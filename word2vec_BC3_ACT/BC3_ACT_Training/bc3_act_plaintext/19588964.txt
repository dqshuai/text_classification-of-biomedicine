Reconstruction of Cu(100) electrode surfaces during hydrogen evolution.

H Matsushima, A Taranovskyy, C Haak, Y Gr√ºnder, OM Magnussen

Electrochemical hydrogen evolution on (100)-oriented copper electrodes is shown to induce a novel surface reconstruction, which substantially influences the rates of this electrochemical reaction. As revealed by in situ video-STM the formation of this phase starts with lateral displacements of Cu surface atoms from lattice positions, resulting in stripe-like structures, followed by expansion of the surface lattice along the stripe direction.
