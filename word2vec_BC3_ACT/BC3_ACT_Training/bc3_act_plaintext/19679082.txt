Structure

Catalytically incompetent by design.

R Gao, AM Stock

Sondermann and colleagues have characterized FimX, a protein with degenerate GGDEF and EAL domains. The study confirms the expected domain folds lacking conserved catalytic residues for c-di-GMP synthesis/degradation, and also defines domain arrangements, providing insight to regulatory mechanisms.
