Analysis of gene transcripts in a crude oil-degrading marine microbial community.

S Kato, K Watanabe

We established a procedure for analyzing gene transcripts in a microbial community of unknown genomic background. Analysis of a crude oil-degrading marine microbial community detected the expression of genes related to the biodegradation of fatty acids and the biosynthesis of glycolipids probably involved in the emulsification of crude oil.
