Identification of a polymorphism in the RING finger of human Bmi-1 that causes its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

J Zhang, KD Sarge

Bmi-1 is a polycomb protein that plays an important role in tumor cell development and maintaining stem cell populations of many cell lineages. Here we identify a polymorphism in human Bmi-1 that changes a cysteine within its RING domain to tyrosine. This C18Y polymorphism is associated with a significant decrease in Bmi-1 level and its elevated ubiquitination, suggesting that it is being destroyed by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Consistent with this, treating cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 significantly increases C18Y Bmi-1 levels. This is the first example of a polymorphism in Bmi-1 that reduces levels of this important protein.
