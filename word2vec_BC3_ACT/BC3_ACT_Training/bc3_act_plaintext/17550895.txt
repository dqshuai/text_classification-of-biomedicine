AtCCMA interacts with AtCcmB to form a novel mitochondrial ABC transporter involved in cytochrome c maturation in Arabidopsis.

ABC transporters make a large and diverse family of proteins found in all phylae. AtCCMA is the nucleotide binding domain of a novel Arabidopsis mitochondrial ABC transporter. It is encoded in the nucleus and imported into mitochondria. Sub-organellar and topology studies find AtCCMA bound to the mitochondrial inner membrane, facing the matrix. AtCCMA exhibits an ATPase activity, and ATP/Mg(2+) can facilitate its dissociation from membranes. Blue Native PAGE shows that it is part of a 480-kDa complex. Yeast two-hybrid assays reveal interactions between AtCCMA and domains of CcmB, the mitochondria-encoded transmembrane protein of a conserved ABC transporter. All these properties designate the protein as the ortholog in plant mitochondria of the bacterial CcmA required for cytochrome c maturation. The transporter that involves AtCCMA defines a new category of eukaryotic ABC proteins because its transmembrane and nucleotide binding domains are encoded by separate genomes.
