Enhanced susceptibility to atherosclerosis from severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) resulting from lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency has been demonstrated in our recent findings which employed a unique mouse model. In the present study we provide further evidence that severe HTG due to LPL deficiency also promotes an atherothrombotic response to arterial injury induced by ferric chloride in a severe combined hyperlipidemic mouse model. Methods and results: A mouse model (LPL(-/-)XApoE(-/-) double knockout, DKO) with severe combined hyperlipidemia was established by crossing ApoE and LPL-deficient mice. The common carotid arteries of ApoE knockout (EKO) and DKO mice were subjected to injury by ferric chloride, and the formation of arterial thrombosis together with various markers were compared in these lesions. DKO mice demonstrated significantly enhanced thrombus formation overlying atherosclerotic plaque after injury, which contained smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and neutral lipid. The area of neointima, mean intima/media ratios, and the percentage of luminal stenosis were significantly greater (P<0.01) in DKO mice. Compared with EKO mice, the expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) were increased in DKO mice. Conclusions: Severe combined hyperlipidemia promotes thrombosis after ferric chloride injury to atherosclerotic vessels and HTG plays a major role in the process.
