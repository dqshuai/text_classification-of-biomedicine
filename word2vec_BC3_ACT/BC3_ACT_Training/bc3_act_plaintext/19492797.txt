Nucleotide-responsive wettability on a smart polymer surface.

G Qing, X Wang, H Fuchs, T Sun

A smart copolymer film that is sensitive to nucleotide species in solution was developed. The film exhibits ann excellent reversible wettability response to nucleotide solutions, which is accompanied by a phase change and the corresponding swell and shrinkage of the copolymer.
