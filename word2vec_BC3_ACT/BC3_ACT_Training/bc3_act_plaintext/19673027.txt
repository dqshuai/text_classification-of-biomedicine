Duodenal obstruction after successful embolization for duodenal diverticular hemorrhage: a case report.

YJ Kwon, JH Kim, SH Kim, BS Kim, HU Kim, EK Choi, IH Jeong

We present a 69-year-old woman with a duodenal obstruction after successful selective transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for a duodenal diverticular hemorrhage. Two weeks after TAE, the patient showed abrupt symptoms of duodenal obstruction. Resolving hematomas after successful selective transcatheter arterial embolization should be thoroughly observed because they might result in duodenal fibrotic encasement featuring inflammatory duodenal wall thickening, duodenal deformity, dysmotility, and finally obstruction.
