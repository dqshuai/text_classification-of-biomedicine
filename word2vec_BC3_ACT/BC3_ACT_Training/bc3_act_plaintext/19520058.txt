Alix and TSG101, known to physically interact with each other, have Pro-rich regions that are bound by ALG-2 Ca2+-dependently. We investigated the role of ALG-2 in the Alix-TSG101 association by pulldown assays using Strep-tagged Alix and its various mutants. The ALG-2-binding site was required for the Ca2+-dependent pulldown of TSG101 using HEK293T cells, whereas the PSAP sequence, a binding motif for the UEV domain of TSG101, was dispensable. Alix-TSG101 association was not observed using ALG-2-knockdown cells but became detectable by addition of the purified recombinant ALG-2 protein in the assay mixtures. Exogenous expression of mGFP-fused ALG-2 also restored the pulldown capability of Strep-Alix, but an alternatively spliced shorter ALG-2 isoform and a dimerization-defective mutant were incompetent. Based on the X-ray crystal structure model showing the presence of one ligand-binding site in each molecule of an ALG-2 dimer, we propose that Ca2+-loaded ALG-2 bridges Alix and TSG101 as an adaptor protein.
