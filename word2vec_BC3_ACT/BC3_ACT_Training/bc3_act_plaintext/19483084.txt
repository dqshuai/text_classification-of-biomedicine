Activation of RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway and the associated changes in actin cytoskeleton induced by thrombin are crucial for activation of NF-kappaB and expression of its target gene ICAM-1 in endothelial cells. However, the events acting downstream of RhoA/ROCK to mediate these responses remain unclear. Here, we show a central role of cofilin-1, an actin-binding protein that promotes actin depolymerization, in linking RhoA/ROCK pathway to dynamic alterations in actin cytoskeleton that are necessary for activation of NF-kappaB and thereby expression of ICAM-1 in these cells. Stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with thrombin resulted in Ser(3) phosphorylation/inactivation of cofilin and formation of actin stress fibers in a ROCK-dependent manner. RNA interference knockdown of cofilin-1 stabilized the actin filaments and inhibited thrombin- and RhoA-induced NF-kappaB activity. Similarly, constitutively inactive mutant of cofilin-1 (Cof1-S3D), known to stabilize the actin cytoskeleton, inhibited NF-kappaB activity by thrombin. Overexpression of wild type cofilin-1 or constitutively active cofilin-1 mutant (Cof1-S3A), known to destabilize the actin cytoskeleton, also impaired thrombin-induced NF-kappaB activity. Additionally, depletion of cofilin-1 was associated with a marked reduction in ICAM-1 expression induced by thrombin. The effect of cofilin-1 depletion on NF-kappaB activity and ICAM-1 expression occurred downstream of IkappaBalpha degradation and was a result of impaired RelA/p65 nuclear translocation and consequently, RelA/p65 binding to DNA. Together, these data show that cofilin-1 occupies a central position in RhoA-actin pathway mediating nuclear translocation of RelA/p65 and expression of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells.
