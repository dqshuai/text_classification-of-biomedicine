Posttranslational modification by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) controls diverse cellular functions of transcription factors and coregulators and participates in various cellular processes including signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. Here, we report that pontin, a component of chromatin-remodeling complexes, is SUMO-modified, and that SUMOylation of pontin is an active control mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of pontin on androgen-receptor target genes in prostate cancer cells. Biochemical purification of pontin-containing complexes revealed the presence of the Ubc9 SUMO-conjugating enzyme that underlies its function as an activator. Intriguingly, 5alpha-dihydroxytestosterone treatments significantly increased the SUMOylation of pontin, and SUMOylated pontin showed further activation of a subset of nuclear receptor-dependent transcription and led to an increase in proliferation and growth of prostate cancer cells. These data clearly define a functional model and provide a link between SUMO modification and prostate cancer progression.
