DNA, whether it is microbe-derived or host-derived, evokes immune responses when exposed to the cytosol of a cell. We previously reported that DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factors (DAI), also referred to as DLM-1/ZBP1, functions as a DNA sensor that activates the innate immune system. In the present study, we examined the regulation of the complex DNA-sensing system by DAI and other molecules. We first show that DAI directly interacts with DNA in vitro and that it requires three DNA-binding domains for full activation in vivo. We also show that the artificially induced dimerization of DAI results in the DNA-independent activation of type I IFN genes, thereby providing a better understanding for the molecular basis of DAI activation. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the presence of additional DNA sensors, either positively or negatively regulating cytosolic DNA-mediated innate immune responses. These results in toto provide insights into the mechanism of DAI activation and reveal the complex regulatory mechanisms underlying DNA-mediated protective and pathologic immune responses.
