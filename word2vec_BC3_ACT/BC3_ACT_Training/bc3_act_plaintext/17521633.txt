Characterization of zinc finger protein 496 that interacts with Jumonji/Jarid2.

MR Mysliwiec, TG Kim, Y Lee

Jumonij (JMJ)/Jarid2 plays important roles in embryonic development and functions as a transcriptional repressor. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we have identified a cofactor of JMJ, the zinc finger protein 496 (Zfp496) that contains a SCAN, KRAB and zinc finger domain. Our molecular analyses indicate that Zfp496 functions as a transcriptional activator. Further, Zfp496 inhibits the transcriptional repression of JMJ and JMJ represses the transcriptional activation of Zfp496. This study demonstrates that JMJ physically and functionally interacts with Zfp496, which will provide important insights into endogenous target gene regulation by both factors.
