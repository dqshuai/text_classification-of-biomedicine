Melanoma-initiating cells: a compass needed.

Y Refaeli, A Bhoumik, DR Roop, ZA Ronai

Most tumours contain a heterogeneous population of cancer cells, which harbour a range of genetic mutations and have probably undergone deregulated differentiation programmes that allow them to adapt to tumour microenvironments. Another explanation for tumour heterogeneity might be that the cells within a tumour are derived from tumour-initiating cells through diverse differentiation programmes. Tumour-initiating cells are thought to constitute one or more distinct subpopulations within a tumour and to drive tumour initiation, development and metastasis, as well as to be responsible for their recurrence after therapy. Recent studies have raised crucial questions about the nature, frequency and importance of melanoma-initiating cells. Here, we discuss our current understanding of melanoma-initiating cells and outline several approaches that the scientific community might consider to resolve the controversies surrounding these cells.
