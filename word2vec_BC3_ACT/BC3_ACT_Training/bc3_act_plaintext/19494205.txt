PURPOSE: Glaucoma may involve disturbances in retinal oxygenation and blood flow. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of glaucoma filtration surgery on retinal vessel oxygen saturation. METHODS: A noninvasive spectrophotometric retinal oximeter was used to measure hemoglobin oxygen saturation in retinal arterioles and venules before and after glaucoma filtration surgery. Twenty-five consecutive patients were recruited, and 19 had adequate image quality. Fourteen underwent trabeculectomy and five glaucoma tube surgery. Twelve had primary open-angle glaucoma and seven had exfoliative glaucoma. IOP decreased from 23 +/- 7 to 10 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean +/- SD, P = 0.0001). RESULTS: Oxygen saturation increased in retinal arterioles from 97% +/- 4% to 99% +/- 6% (n = 19; P = 0.046) after surgery and was unchanged in venules (63% +/- 5% before surgery and 64% +/- 6% after, P = 0.76). There were no significant changes in saturation in the fellow eyes (P > 0.60). The arteriovenous difference was 34% before and 36% after surgery (P = 0.35). CONCLUSIONS: Glaucoma filtration surgery had almost no effect on retinal vessel oxygen saturation.
