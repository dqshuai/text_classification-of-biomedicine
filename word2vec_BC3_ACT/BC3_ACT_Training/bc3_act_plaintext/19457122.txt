Temporal lobe epilepsy is a common form of pharmacoresistant epilepsy, in which epileptogenic foci propagate to other regions of the brain from the area of the initial insult. The present study focused on epileptogenesis, that is, the development of the first foci inducing seizures in amygdala-kindled mice, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy, to find the molecular process promoting the formation of epileptogenic networks. The expression of growth hormone (GH) was up-regulated along neural circuits during the epileptogenesis, while there was no difference in the pituitary gland. The up-regulation was associated with increased phosphorylation/activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and expression of the Serum Response Element-regulated genes, FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene, early growth response 1, and Jun-B oncogene, suggesting that expression of GH leads to GH signaling in the hippocampus and cortex. Furthermore, the administration of the hormone into the hippocampus markedly enhanced the progression of kindling. The administration of an inhibitor of its secretion into the hippocampus elicited a delay in the progression. Our results demonstrate directly that regulation via growth hormone has a robust impact in epileptogenesis.
