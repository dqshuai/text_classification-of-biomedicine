Although microbes have been used in industrial and niche applications for several decades, successful immobilization of microbes while maintaining their usefulness for any desired application has been elusive. Such a functionally bioactive system has distinct advantages over conventional batch and continuous-flow microbial reactor systems that are used in various biotechnological processes. This article describes the use of polyethylene oxide(99)-polypropylene oxide(67)-polyethylene oxide(99) triblock polymer fibers, created via electrospinning, to encapsulate microbes of 3 industrially relevant genera, namely, Pseudomonas, Zymomonas, and Escherichia. The presence of bacteria inside the fibers was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and SEM. Although the electrospinning process typically uses harsh organic solvents and extreme conditions that generally are harmful to bacteria, we describe techniques that overcome these limitations. The encapsulated microbes were viable for several months, and their metabolic activity was not affected by immobilization; thus they could be used in various applications. Furthermore, we have engineered a microbe-encapsulated cross-linked fibrous polymeric material that is insoluble. Also, the microbe-encapsulated active matrix permits efficient exchange of nutrients and metabolic products between the microorganism and the environment. The present results demonstrate the potential of the electrospinning technique for the encapsulation and immobilization of bacteria in the form of a synthetic biofilm, while retaining their metabolic activity. This study has wide-ranging implications in the engineering and use of novel bio-hybrid materials or biological thin-film catalysts.
