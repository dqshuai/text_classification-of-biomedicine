Interactions of DNA with biofilm-derived membrane vesicles.

SR Schooling, A Hubley, TJ Beveridge

The biofilm matrix contributes to the chemistry, structure, and function of biofilms. Biofilm-derived membrane vesicles (MVs) and DNA, both matrix components, demonstrated concentration-, pH-, and cation-dependent interactions. Furthermore, MV-DNA association influenced MV surface properties. This bears consequences for the reactivity and availability for interaction of matrix polymers and other constituents.
