Stimulation of Akt poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in P388D1 cells by 7-ketocholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol.

Akt plays a role in protecting macrophages from apoptosis induced by some oxysterols. Previously we observed enhanced degradation of Akt in P388D1 moncocyte/macrophages following treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) or 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC). In the present report we examine the role of the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway in this process. We show that treatment with 25-OH or 7-KC results in the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated Akt, an effect that is enhanced by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Modification of Akt by the addition of a Gly-Ala repeat (GAr), a domain known to block ubiquitin-dependent targeting of proteins to the proteasome, resulted in a chimeric protein that is resistant to turn-over induced by 25-OH or 7-KC and provides protection from apoptosis induced by these oxysterols. These results uncover a new aspect of oxysterol regulation of Akt in macrophages; oxysterol-stimulated poly-ubiquitination of Akt and degradation by the proteasomal pathway.
