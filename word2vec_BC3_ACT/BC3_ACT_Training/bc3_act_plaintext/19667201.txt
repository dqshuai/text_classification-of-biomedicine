The mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) contains many small cysteine-bearing proteins, and their passage across the outer membrane and subsequent folding require recognition and disulfide bond transfer by an oxidative translocator Tim40/Mia40 in the inner membrane facing the IMS. Here we determined the crystal structure of the core domain of yeast Mia40 (Mia40C4) as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein at a resolution of 3 A. The overall structure of Mia40C4 is a fruit-dish-like shape with a hydrophobic concave region, which accommodates a linker segment of the fusion protein in a helical conformation, likely mimicking a bound substrate. Replacement of the hydrophobic residues in this region resulted in growth defects and impaired assembly of a substrate protein. The Cys296-Cys298 disulfide bond is close to the hydrophobic concave region or possible substrate-binding site, so that it can mediate disulfide bond transfer to substrate proteins. These results are consistent with the growth phenotypes of Mia40 mutant cells containing Ser replacement of the conserved cysteine residues.
