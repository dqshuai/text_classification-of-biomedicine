Novel cellular organization in a gliding mycoplasma, Mycoplasma insons.

RF Relich, AJ Friedberg, MF Balish

Mycoplasmas that are known to exhibit gliding motility possess a differentiated tip structure. This polar organelle mediates cytadherence and gliding motor activity and contains a cytoskeleton-like component that provides structural support. Here, we describe gliding motility and a unique cytoskeleton in Mycoplasma insons, which lacks any obviously differentiated tip structure.
