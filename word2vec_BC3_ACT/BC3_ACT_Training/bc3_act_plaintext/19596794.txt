Leaf trichomes serve as a physical barrier and can also secrete antimicrobial compounds to protect plants from attacks by insects and pathogens. Besides the use of the physical and chemical mechanisms, leaf trichomes might also support plant responses by communicating the extrinsic cues to plant intrinsic signalling pathways. Here we report a role of leaf trichomes in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) hypersensitive cell death (HCD) induced by ParA1, an elicitin protein from a plant-pathogenic oomycete. After localized treatment with ParA1, reactive oxygen species were produced first in the leaf trichomes and then in mesophylls. Reactive oxygen species are a group of intracellular signals that are crucial for HCD to develop and for cells to undergo cell death subsequent to chromatin condensation, a hallmark of HCD. These events were impaired when the production of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was inhibited by catalase or a NADPH-oxidase inhibitor applied to trichomes, suggesting the importance of H(2)O(2) in the pathway of HCD signal transduction from the trichomes to mesophylls. This pathway was no longer activated when leaf trichomes were treated with C51S, a ParA1 mutant protein defective in its interaction with N. tabacum TTG1 (NtTTG1), which is a trichome protein that binds ParA1, rather than C51S, in vitro and in trichome cells. The ParA1-NtTTG1 interaction and the HCD pathway were also abrogated when NtTTG1 was silenced in the trichomes. These observations suggest that NtTTG1 plays an essential role in HCD signal transduction from leaf trichomes to mesophylls.
