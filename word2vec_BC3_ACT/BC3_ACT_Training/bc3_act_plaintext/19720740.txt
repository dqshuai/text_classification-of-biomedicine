Hypoxia induces apoptosis but also triggers adaptive mechanisms to ensure cell survival. Here we show that the prosurvival effects of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in endothelial cells are mediated by neuron-derived orphan receptor 1 (NOR-1). The overexpression of NOR-1 decreased the rate of endothelial cells undergoing apoptosis in cultures exposed to hypoxia, while the inhibition of NOR-1 increased cell apoptosis. Hypoxia upregulated NOR-1 mRNA levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Blocking antibodies against VEGF or SU5614 (a VEGF receptor 2 inhibitor) did not prevent hypoxia-induced NOR-1 expression, suggesting that NOR-1 is not induced by the autocrine secretion of VEGF in response to hypoxia. The reduction of HIF-1 alpha protein levels by small interfering RNAs, or by inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway or mTOR, significantly counteracted hypoxia-induced NOR-1 upregulation. Intracellular Ca(2+) was involved in hypoxia-induced PI3K/Akt activation and in the downstream NOR-1 upregulation. A hypoxia response element mediated the transcriptional activation of NOR-1 induced by hypoxia as we show by transient transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Finally, the attenuation of NOR-1 expression reduced both basal and hypoxia-induced cIAP2 (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2) mRNA levels, while NOR-1 overexpression upregulated cIAP2. Therefore, NOR-1 is a downstream effector of HIF-1 signaling involved in the survival response of endothelial cells to hypoxia.
