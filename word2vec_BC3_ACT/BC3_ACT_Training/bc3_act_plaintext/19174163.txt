Pituitary homeobox 2 (PITX2) is a homeodomain transcription factor that has a substantial role in cell proliferation and differentiation in various tissues. In this report, we have conducted a systematic study, using proteomic and genomic approaches, to characterize PITX2-interacting proteins and PITX2-regulating genes. We identified four novel PITX2-associated protein partners Y box binding factor-1, heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein K, nucleolin and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U in mass spectrometry analysis. We also found that overexpression of PITX2 upregulated 868 genes (2-25-fold) and downregulated 191 genes (2-15-fold) in DNA microarray analysis. These data provide an insightful perspective for further studying PITX2 function and mechanism of action.
