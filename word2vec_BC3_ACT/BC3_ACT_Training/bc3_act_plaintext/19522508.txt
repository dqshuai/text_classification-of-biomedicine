Liquid-phase synthesis of block copolymers containing sequence-ordered segments.

S Pfeifer, Z Zarafshani, N Badi, JF Lutz

Monodisperse sequence-defined oligomers have been synthesized in solution in the absence of protecting groups. These structures have been prepared stepwise using two consecutive chemoselective reactions: 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of terminal alkynes and azides and amidification of carboxylic acids with primary amines. These oligomers were efficiently constructed on either a conventional solid support (commercial Wang resin) or tailor-made soluble polystyrene supports synthesized by atom-transfer radical polymerization. The latter approach was found to be very versatile. Indeed, well-defined soluble macromolecular supports allowed not only the synthesis and cleavage of defined oligomers (i.e., sacrificial support) but also the preparation of noncleavable block copolymers containing sequence-defined segments.
