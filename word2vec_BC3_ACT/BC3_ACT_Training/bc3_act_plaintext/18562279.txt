Akt phosphorylation and nuclear phosphoinositide association mediate mRNA export and cell proliferation activities by ALY.

M Okada, SW Jang, K Ye

Nuclear PI3K and its downstream effectors play essential roles in a variety of cellular activities including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and pre-mRNA splicing. Aly is a nuclear speckle protein implicated in mRNA export. Here we show that Aly is a physiological target of nuclear PI3K signaling, which regulates its subnuclear residency, cell proliferation, and mRNA export activities through nuclear Akt phosphorylation and phosphoinositide association. Nuclear Akt phosphorylates Aly on threonine-219, which is required for its interaction with Akt. Aly binds phosphoinositides, and this action is regulated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation. Phosphoinositide binding but not Akt phosphorylation dictates Aly's nuclear speckle residency. Depletion of Aly results in cell growth suppression and mRNA export reduction. Inhibition of Aly phosphorylation substantially decreases cell proliferation and mRNA export. Furthermore, disruption of phosphoinositide association with Aly also significantly reduces these activities. Thus, nuclear PI3K signaling mediates both cell proliferation and mRNA export functions of Aly.
