Coordination-assisted assembly of 1-D nanostructured light-harvesting antenna.

X Zhang, ZK Chen, KP Loh

An efficient light-harvesting antenna was achieved via self-assembly of two distinct chromophores into nanoscale supramolecular coordination polymers (NSCPs). Efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer is favorable in the self-assembled 1-D nanostructure as a result of fast and efficient exciton migration in the ordered architecture.
