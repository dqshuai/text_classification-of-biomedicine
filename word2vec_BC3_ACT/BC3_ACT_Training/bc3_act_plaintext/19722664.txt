Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of alpha-alkylidene-beta-hydroxy esters via dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation involving Ba-catalyzed direct aldol reaction.

A Yamaguchi, S Matsunaga, M Shibasaki

A Ba-catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) involving a direct aldol/retro-aldol reaction of beta,gamma-unsaturated ester donors is described. A Ba(O-iPr)(2)/BINOL complex promoted the direct aldol reaction/isomerization sequence, and alpha-alkylidene-beta-hydroxy esters were obtained from aryl, heteroaryl, alkenyl, and alkyl aldehydes under simple proton-transfer conditions with 99-87% ee and >20:1 to 15:1 alpha/gamma selectivity.
