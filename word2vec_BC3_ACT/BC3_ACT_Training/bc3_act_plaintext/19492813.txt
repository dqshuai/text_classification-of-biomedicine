Functional screening of the former SmithKline Beecham compound collection against the human calcium receptor (CaR) resulted in the identification of the amino alcohol-based hit 2 (IC(50) = 11 microM). Structure-activity studies of 2 focused on the optimization of the right- and left-hand side aromatic moieties as well as the amino alcohol linker region. Critical to the optimization of this antagonist template was the discovery that the chirality of the C-2 secondary alcohol played a key role in enhancing both CaR potency as well as selectivity over the beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes. These SAR studies ultimately led to the identification of 38 (NPS 2143; SB-262470A), a potent and orally active CaR antagonist. Pharmacokinetic characterization of 38 in the rat revealed that this molecule had a large volume of distribution (11 L/kg), which resulted in a prolonged systemic exposure, protracted increases in the plasma levels of PTH, and an overall lack of net bone formation effect in a rodent model of osteoporosis.
