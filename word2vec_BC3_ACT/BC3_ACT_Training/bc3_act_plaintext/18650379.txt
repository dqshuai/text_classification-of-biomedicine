S-nitrosylation/activation of COX-2 mediates NMDA neurotoxicity.

J Tian, SF Kim, L Hester, SH Snyder

Glutamate/N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated neurotoxicity involves cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. We demonstrate that this neurotoxicity reflects activation of COX-2 by S-nitrosylation after selective binding of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) to COX-2. nNOS, via its PDZ domain, binds COX-2 with the generated NO S-nitrosylating and activating the enzyme. Selective disruption of nNOS-COX-2 binding prevents NMDA neurotoxicity.
