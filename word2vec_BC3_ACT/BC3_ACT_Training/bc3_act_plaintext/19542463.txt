Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are located in the lymphoid follicles of secondary lymphoid tissues and play a pivotal role in the selection of memory B lymphocytes within the germinal center, a major site for HIV-1 infection. Germinal centers are composed of highly activated B cells, macrophages, CD4(+)T cells, and FDCs. However, the physiological role of FDCs in HIV-1 replication remains largely unknown. We demonstrate in our current study that FDCs can efficiently activate HIV-1 replication in latently infected monocytic cells via an intercellular communication network mediated by the P-selectin/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) interaction. Upon coculture with FDCs, HIV-1 replication was significantly induced in infected monocytic cell lines, primary monocytes, or macrophages. These cocultures were found to synergistically induce the expression of P-selectin in FDCs via NF-kappaB activation and its cognate receptor PSGL-1 in HIV-1-infected cells. Consistent with this observation, we find that this response is significantly blocked by antagonistic Abs against PSGL-1 and almost completely inhibited by PSGL-1 small interfering RNA. Moreover, a selective inhibitor for Syk, which is a downstream effector of PSGL-1, blocked HIV-1 replication in our cultures. We have thus elucidated a novel regulatory mechanism in which FDCs are a potent positive bystander that facilitates HIV-1 replication in adjacent infected monocytic cells via a juxtacrine signaling mechanism.
