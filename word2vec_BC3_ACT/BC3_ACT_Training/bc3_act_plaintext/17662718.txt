Protein-protein interactions among human lens acidic and basic beta-crystallins.

BF Liu, JJ Liang

Human lens beta-crystallin contains four acidic (betaA1-->betaA4) and three basic (betaB1-->betaB3) subunits. They oligomerize in the lens, but it is uncertain which subunits are involved in the oligomerization. We used a two-hybrid system to detect protein-protein interactions systematically. Proteins were also expressed for some physicochemical studies. The results indicate that all acidic-basic pairs (betaA-betaB) except betaA4-betaBs pairs show strong hetero-molecular interactions. For acidic or basic pairs, only two pairs (betaA1-betaA1 and betaA3-betaA3) show strong self-association. betaA2 and betaA4 show very weak self-association, which arises from their low solubility. Confocal fluorescence microscopy shows enormous protein aggregates in betaA2- or betaA4-crystallin transfected cells. However, coexpression with betaB2-crystallin decreased both the number and size of aggregates. Circular dichroism indicates subtle differences in conformation among beta-crystallins that may have contributed to the differences in interactions.
