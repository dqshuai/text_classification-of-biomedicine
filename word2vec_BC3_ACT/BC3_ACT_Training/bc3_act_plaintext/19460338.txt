PIWI goes solo in the soma.

SH Reynolds, H Ruohola-Baker

The recently discovered piRNA pathway serves to protect the genome from transposon activity in the germline. Now Li et al. and Malone et al. in a recent issue of Cell show that the piRNAs are made by more than one means and that their defensive function extends into the germline's circumjacent soma.
