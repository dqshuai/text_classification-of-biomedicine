Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and its main receptor, Patched (Ptc), are implicated in both neural development and tumorigenesis. Besides its classic morphogenic activity, Shh is also a survival factor. Along this line, Ptc has been shown to function as a dependence receptor; it induces apoptosis in the absence of Shh, whereas its pro-apoptotic activity is blocked in the presence of Shh. Here we show that, in the absence of its ligand, Ptc interacts with the adaptor protein DRAL (downregulated in rhabdomyosarcoma LIM-domain protein; also known as FHL2). DRAL is required for the pro-apoptotic activity of Ptc both in immortalized cells and during neural tube development in chick embryos. We demonstrate that, in the absence of Shh, Ptc recruits a protein complex that includes DRAL, one of the caspase recruitment (CARD)-domain containing proteins TUCAN (family member, 8) or NALP1 (NLR family, pyrin domain containing 1) and apical caspase-9. Ptc triggers caspase-9 activation and enhances cell death through a caspase-9-dependent mechanism. Thus, we propose that in the absence of its ligand Shh the dependence receptor Ptc serves as the anchor for a caspase-activating complex that includes DRAL, and caspase-9.
