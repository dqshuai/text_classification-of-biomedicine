Functional redundancy of yeast proteins Reh1 and Rei1 in cytoplasmic 60S subunit maturation.

KM Parnell, BL Bass

The biogenesis of the large (60S) ribosomal subunit in eukaryotes involves nucleolar, nucleoplasmic, and cytoplasmic steps. The cytoplasmic protein Rei1, found in all eukaryotes, was previously shown to be necessary for the nuclear reimport of 60S subunit export factor Arx1. In this study we investigate the function of Reh1, a protein with high sequence similarity to Rei1. We demonstrate an overlapping function for Reh1 and Rei1 in the cytoplasmic maturation of the 60S subunit that is independent of Arx1 recycling. We observe that strains lacking both Reh1 and Rei1 accumulate salt-labile 60S subunits, suggesting that Reh1/Rei1 is necessary for the cytoplasmic 60S subunit to adopt its mature, stable form.
