Insulin and muscle contraction increase fatty acid transport into muscle by inducing the translocation of FAT/CD36. We examined (a) whether these effects are additive, and (b) whether other fatty acid transporters (FABPpm, FATP1, FATP4, and FATP6) are also induced to translocate. Insulin and muscle contraction increased glucose transport and plasmalemmal GLUT4 independently and additively (positive control). Palmitate transport was also stimulated independently and additively by insulin and by muscle contraction. Insulin and muscle contraction increased plasmalemmal FAT/CD36, FABPpm, FATP1, and FATP4, but not FATP6. Only FAT/CD36 and FATP1 were stimulated in an additive manner by insulin and by muscle contraction.
