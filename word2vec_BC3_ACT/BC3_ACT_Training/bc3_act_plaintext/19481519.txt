Related mechanisms for mRNA and rRNA quality control.

KD Swisher, R Parker

In this issue of Molecular Cell, Cole et al. (2009) provide evidence that different defects in rRNA function are recognized by distinct RNA quality control systems, and suggest that a stalled ribosome can trigger either no-go decay of the mRNA or degradation of a nonfunctional 18S rRNA.
