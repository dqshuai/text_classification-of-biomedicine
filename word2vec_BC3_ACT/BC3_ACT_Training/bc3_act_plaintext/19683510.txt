MUC1 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein aberrantly overexpressed in various cancer cells. It is thought to serve as a physical barrier from the extracellular environment and also as a receptor for various extracellular molecules. However, little is known about the fate of MUC1 during and after the interaction with these molecules. In the present study, we used anti-MUC1 antibody as an interacting molecule and investigated the cellular trafficking of MUC1. Our results showed that: (1) anti-MUC1 antibody was internalized only in MUC1 expressing cells and triggered internalization and down-regulation of MUC1; (2) the internalization of MUC1 by anti-MUC1 antibody required the cytoplasmic tail of MUC1 and was suppressed by inhibitors of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, and caveola/raft-dependent internalization, but not by an inhibitor of clathrin-dependent internalization. We conclude that antibody-induced internalization of MUC1 involves the macropinocytotic pathway.
