Replication protein A (RPA) is a stable heterotrimeric complex consisting of p70, p32 and p14 subunits. The protein plays a crucial role in SV40 minichromosome replication. Peptides of p70 representing interaction sites for the smaller two subunits, DNA as well as the viral initiator protein large T-antigen (Tag) and the cellular DNA polymerase alpha-primase (Pol) all interfered with the replication process indicating the importance of the different p70 activities in this process. Inhibition by the peptide disrupting protein-protein interactions was observed only during the pre-initiation stage prior to primer synthesis, suggesting the formation of a stable initiation complex between RPA, Tag and Pol at the primer end.
