Cell cycle quiescence can suppress transcription from an ecdysone receptor-based inducible promoter in mammalian cells.

Inducible gene expression is a powerful tool for basic research, gene therapy and biotechnology, whose utility depends in part on consistent levels of induction regardless of metabolic status or physiological context. Here we examined the inducibility of the ecdysone receptor-based RheoSwitch mammalian inducible expression system in proliferating cells and in cell cycle-arrested cells. We found that both contact inhibition and growth arrest subsequent to serum deprivation dramatically reduced the levels of induction of reporter genes that could be achieved in 3T3 fibroblasts but in not NMuMG mammary epithelial cells. These data have implications for the use of the RheoSwitch system in inducible gene expression applications.
