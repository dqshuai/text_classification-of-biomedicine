Cerebral activity during the anesthesia-like state induced by mesopontine microinjection of pentobarbital.

Microinjection of pentobarbital into a restricted region of rat brainstem, the mesopontine tegmental anesthesia area (MPTA), induces a reversible anesthesia-like state characterized by loss of the righting reflex, atonia, antinociception, and loss of consciousness as assessed by electroencephalogram synchronization. We examined cerebral activity during this state using FOS expression as a marker. Animals were anesthetized for 50 min with a series of intracerebral microinjections of pentobarbital or with systemic pentobarbital and intracerebral microinjections of vehicle. FOS expression was compared with that in awake animals microinjected with vehicle. Neural activity was suppressed throughout the cortex whether anesthesia was induced by systemic or MPTA routes. Changes were less consistent subcortically. In the zona incerta and the nucleus raphe pallidus, expression was strongly suppressed during systemic anesthesia, but only mildly during MPTA-induced anesthesia. Dissociation was seen in the tuberomammillary nucleus where suppression occurred during systemic-induced anesthesia only, and in the lateral habenular nucleus where activity was markedly increased during systemic-induced anesthesia but not following intracerebral microinjection. Several subcortical nuclei previously associated with cerebral arousal were not affected. In the MPTA itself FOS expression was suppressed during systemic anesthesia. Differences in the pattern of brain activity in the two modes of anesthesia are consistent with the possibility that anesthetic endpoints might be achieved by alternative mechanisms: direct drug action for systemic anesthesia or via ascending pathways for MPTA-induced anesthesia. However, it is also possible that systemically administered agents induce anesthesia, at least in part, by a primary action in the MPTA with cortical inhibition occurring secondarily.
