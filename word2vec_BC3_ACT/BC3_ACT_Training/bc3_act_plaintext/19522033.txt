AIM: To investigate the protein and mRNA expression of semaphorin 5A and its receptor plexin B3 in gastric carcinoma and explore its role in the invasion and metastasis of gastric carcinoma. METHODS: Expression of semaphorin 5A and its receptor plexin B3 in 48 samples of primary gastric carcinoma, its corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa, and matched regional lymph node metastasis was assayed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: The protein and mRNA expression of semaphorin 5A and its receptor plexin B3 increased gradually in non-neoplastic mucosa, primary gastric carcinoma and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). Moreover, the expression of semaphorin 5A was closely correlated with that of plexin B3. CONCLUSION: Semaphorin 5A and its receptor plexin B3 play an important role in the invasion and metastasis of gastric carcinoma.
