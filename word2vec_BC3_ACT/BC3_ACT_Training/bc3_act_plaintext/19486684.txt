Energetics of ErbB1 transmembrane domain dimerization in lipid bilayers.

One of the most extensively studied receptor tyrosine kinases is EGFR/ErbB1. Although our knowledge of the role of the extracellular domains and ligands in ErbB1 activation has increased dramatically based on solved domain structures, the exact mechanism of signal transduction across the membrane remains unknown. The transmembrane domains are expected to play an important role in the dimerization process, but the contribution of ErbB1 TM domain to dimer stability is not known, with published results contradicting one another. We address this controversy by showing that ErbB1 TM domain dimerizes in lipid bilayers and by calculating its contribution to stability as -2.5 kcal/mol. The stability calculations use two different methods based on FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer, which give the same result. The ErbB1 TM domain contribution to stability exceeds the change in receptor tyrosine kinases dimerization propensities that can convert normal signaling processes into pathogenic processes, and is thus likely important for biological function.
