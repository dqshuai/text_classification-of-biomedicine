Adeno-associated virus infection of murine fibroblasts with help provided by mouse adenovirus.

V Bhrigu, JP Trempe

Adeno-associated virus (AAV-2) replicates to high titers when host cells are coinfected with a helper virus. Here we analyzed the coinfection of AAV-2 and mouse adenovirus (MAV-1) in murine fibroblasts. We observed that AAV-2/MAV-1 coinfected NIH 3T3 cells produced approximately 10-40-fold less AAV-2 DNAse resistant particles than Hela cells. Levels of AAV-2 DNA replication were approximately 30-fold less in 3T3 cells as compared to Hela cells coinfected with human adenovirus (Ad-5). A study of these lower levels of infection in 3T3 cells compared to Hela cells revealed that receptor binding and internalization of AAV-2 in 3T3 and Hela cells was comparable. However, AAV-2 did not enter into the nucleus of mouse cells as efficiently as it does in human cells. Furthermore, viral DNA replication levels of AAV-2 DNA were found to be lower in mouse cells than human cells, indicating limitations in the murine nucleus for viral replication.
