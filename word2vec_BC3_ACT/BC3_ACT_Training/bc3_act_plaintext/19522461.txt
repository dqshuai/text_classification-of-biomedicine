From thiophene [2]rotaxane to polythiophene polyrotaxane.

T Ikeda, M Higuchi, DG Kurth

The polythiophene polyrotaxane was synthesized through electrochemical polymerization of the [2]rotaxane consisting of the electron-rich dumbbell-shaped sexithiophene and the electron-deficient cyclophane of cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene). The optical and electrochemical property of the polythiophene polyrotaxane film was characterized. The material reported herein is attractive not only as a component for constructing the macromolecular machine but also as a new type of insulated molecular wire having donor-acceptor interaction between the macrocycle and the conductive polymer.
