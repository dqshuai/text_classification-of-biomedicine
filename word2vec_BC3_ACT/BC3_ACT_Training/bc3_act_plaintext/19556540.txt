Hypertension of Kcnmb1-/- is linked to deficient K secretion and aldosteronism.

Mice lacking the beta1-subunit (gene, Kcnmb1; protein, BK-beta1) of the large Ca-activated K channel (BK) are hypertensive. This phenotype is thought to result from diminished BK currents in vascular smooth muscle where BK-beta1 is an ancillary subunit. However, the beta1-subunit is also expressed in the renal connecting tubule (CNT), a segment of the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron, where it associates with BK and facilitates K secretion. Because of the correlation between certain forms of hypertension and renal defects, particularly in the distal nephron, it was determined whether the hypertension of Kcnmb1(-/-) has a renal origin. We found that Kcnmb1(-/-) are hypertensive, volume expanded, and have reduced urinary K and Na clearances. These conditions are exacerbated when the animals are fed a high K diet (5% K; HK). Supplementing HK-fed Kcnmb1(-/-) with eplerenone (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) corrected the fluid imbalance and more than 70% of the hypertension. Finally, plasma [aldo] was elevated in Kcnmb1(-/-) under basal conditions (control diet, 0.6% K) and increased significantly more than wild type when fed the HK diet. We conclude that the majority of the hypertension of Kcnmb1(-/-) is due to aldosteronism, resulting from renal potassium retention and hyperkalemia.
