The crystal structure of flavoredoxin from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F was determined at 1.05 A resolution and its ferric reductase activity was examined. The aim was to elucidate whether flavoredoxin has structural similarity to ferric reductase and ferric reductase activity, based on the sequence similarity to ferric reductase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. As expected, flavoredoxin shared a common overall structure with A. fulgidus ferric reductase and displayed weak ferric reductase and flavin reductase activities; however, flavoredoxin contains two FMN molecules per dimer, unlike A. fulgidus ferric reductase, which has only one FMN molecule per dimer. Compared with A. fulgidus ferric reductase, flavoredoxin forms three additional hydrogen bonds and has a significantly smaller solvent-accessible surface area. These observations explain the higher affinity of flavoredoxin for FMN. Unexpectedly, an electron-density map indicated the presence of a Mes molecule on the re-side of the isoalloxazine ring of FMN, and that two zinc ions are bound to the two cysteine residues, Cys39 and Cys40, adjacent to FMN. These two cysteine residues are close to one of the putative ferric ion binding sites of ferric reductase. Based on their structural similarities, we conclude that the corresponding site of ferric reductase is the most plausible site for ferric ion binding. Comparing the structures with related flavin proteins revealed key structural features regarding the discrimination of function (ferric ion or flavin reduction) and a unique electron transport system.
