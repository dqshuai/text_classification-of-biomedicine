cIAP proteins: keystones in NOD receptor signal transduction.

C Reardon, TW Mak

NOD1 and 2 are intracellular sentinels critical to innate immunity. In this issue of Immunity, Bertrand et al. (2009) fill in a gap in the NOD signaling cascade by demonstrating that cIAP1 and 2 function as E3 ubiquitin ligases for the RIP2 signaling molecule.
