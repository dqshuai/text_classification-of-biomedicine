Rpb9 is a small non-essential subunit of yeast RNA polymerase II located on the surface on the enzyme. Deletion of the RPB9 gene shows synthetic lethality with the low fidelity rpb1-E1103G mutation localized in the trigger loop, a mobile element of the catalytic Rpb1 subunit, which has been shown to control transcription fidelity. Similar to the rpb1-E1103G mutation, the RPB9 deletion substantially enhances NTP misincorporation and increases the rate of mismatch extension with the next cognate NTP in vitro. Using pre-steady state kinetic analysis, we show that RPB9 deletion promotes sequestration of NTPs in the polymerase active center just prior to the phosphodiester bond formation. We propose a model in which the Rpb9 subunit controls transcription fidelity by delaying the closure of the trigger loop on the incoming NTP via interaction between the C-terminal domain of Rpb9 and the trigger loop. Our findings reveal a mechanism for regulation of transcription fidelity by protein factors located at a large distance from the active center of RNA polymerase II.
