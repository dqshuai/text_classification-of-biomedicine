Protein interaction platforms: visualization of interacting proteins in yeast.

AM Schmitz, MF Morrison, AO Agunwamba, ML Nibert, CF Lesser

Here we describe the protein interaction platform assay, a method for identifying interacting proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This assay relies on the reovirus scaffolding protein microNS, which forms large focal inclusions in living cells. When a query protein is fused to microNS and potential interaction partners are fused to a fluorescent reporter, interactors can be identified by screening for yeast that display fluorescent foci.
