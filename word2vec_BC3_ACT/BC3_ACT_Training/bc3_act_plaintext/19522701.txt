The complement system plays crucial roles in the immune system, but incorrect regulation causes inflammation and targeting of self-tissue, leading to diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and age-related macular degeneration. In vivo, the initiating complexes of the classical complement and lectin pathways are controlled by SERPING1 [(C1 inhibitor) serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade G, member 1], which inactivates the components C1s and MASP-2 (mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase 2). GAGs (glycosaminoglycan) and DXS (dextran sulfate) are able to significantly accelerate SERPING1-mediated inactivation of C1s, the key effector enzyme of the classical C1 complex, although the mechanism is poorly understood. In the present study we have shown that C1s can bind to DXS and heparin and that these polyanions enhanced C1s proteolytic activity at low concentrations and inhibited it at higher concentrations. The recent determination of the crystal structure of SERPING1 has given rise to the hypothesis that both the serpin (serine protease inhibitor)-polyanion and protease-polyanion interactions might be required to accelerate the association rate of SERPING1 and C1s. To determine what proportion of the acceleration was due to protease-polyanion interactions, a chimaeric mutant of alpha1-antitrypsin containing the P4-P1 residues from the SERPING1 RCL (reactive-centre loop) was produced. Like SERPING1, this molecule is able to effectively inhibit C1s, but is unable to bind polyanions. DXS exerted a biphasic effect on the association rate of C1s which correlated strongly with the effect of DXS on C1s proteolytic activity. Thus, whereas polyanions are able to bind C1s and modulate its activity, polyanion interactions with SERPING1 must also play a vital role in the mechanism by which these cofactors accelerate the C1s-SERPING1 reaction.
