Advances in the basic and clinical science of migraine.

A Charles

Migraine continues to be an elephant in the room of medicine: massively common and a heavy burden on patients and their healthcare providers, yet the recipient of relatively little attention for research, education, and clinical resources. Its visibility is gradually increasing, however, as advances in genetics, imaging, epidemiology, and pharmacology produce a more definitive understanding of the condition, and identify more specific and effective treatments. Rapid evolution of concepts regarding its prevalence, pathophysiology, and clinical management is leading to growing recognition of migraine as a fundamentally important disorder of the nervous system.
