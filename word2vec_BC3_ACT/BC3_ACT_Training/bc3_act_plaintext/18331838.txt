Certain proteins can undergo polyglycylation and polyglutamylation. Polyglutamylases (glutamate ligases) have recently been identified in a family of tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) proteins. However, no polyglycylase (glycine ligase) has yet been reported. Here we identify a polyglycylase in the TTLL proteins by using an anti-poly-glycine antibody. The antibody reacted with a cytoplasmic 60-kDa protein that accumulated in elongating spermatids. Using tandem mass spectrometry of trypsinized samples, immunoprecipitated by the antibody from the TTLL10-expressing cells, we identified the 60-kDa protein as nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1). Recombinant TTLL10 incorporated glycine into recombinant NAP1 in vitro. Mutational analyses indicated that Glu residues at 359 and 360 in the C-terminal part of NAP1 are putative sites for the modification. Thus, TTLL10 is a polyglycylase for NAP1.
