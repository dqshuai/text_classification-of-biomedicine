Regulating the regulator: an RNA decoy acts as an OFF switch for the regulation of an sRNA.

P Mandin, S Gottesman

Many bacterial small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) pair with mRNA targets, stimulating or inhibiting mRNA stability and/or translation. Regulation of these sRNAs is usually due to tight transcriptional regulation of synthesis.In this issue of Genes & Development and a related paper in Molecular Microbiology, Figueroa-Bossi and colleagues (pp. 2004-2015) and Overgaard and colleagues report a novel regulatory mechanism in which induction of a competing mRNA acts to titrate away the sRNA, allowing expression of an otherwise strongly inhibited target gene.
