TRAIL receptor mediates inflammatory cytokine release in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner.

In the present article, we report that DR4 or DR5 overexpression dramatically activates the release of the inflammatory cytokines IL-8, TNF-alpha, CCL20, MIP-2 and MIP-1beta in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner in 293T, MDA-MB-231 and HCT-116 cells. We showed that death receptor-mediated signals were extracellular domain-independent, whereas the effect of overexpression of the DR4 intracellular domain was much less potent. The TRADD-TRAF2-NIK-IKKalpha/beta signaling cascade, which plays an essential role in TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation, was found to be involved in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor-mediated signal transduction. The FADD-caspase signaling pathway, which has been reported to be mostly related to apoptosis, was identified as being essential for DR4 or DR5 overexpression-mediated NF-kappaB activation and cytokine secretion and crosstalks with the TRADD-TRAF2-NIK-IKKalpha/beta signaling cascade. Furthermore, a DR5 agonistic antibody (AD5-10) triggered the inflammatory cytokine release. These data, together with previous reports, provide strong evidence that TRAIL and TRAIL receptors play an important role in inflammation.
