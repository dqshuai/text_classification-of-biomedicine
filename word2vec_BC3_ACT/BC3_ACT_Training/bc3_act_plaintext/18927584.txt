Blm10 binds to pre-activated proteasome core particles with open gate conformation.

A Lehmann, K Jechow, C Enenkel

Blm10 is bound to the yeast proteasome core particle, a crucial protease of eukaryotic cells [corrected]. Two gates, at both ends of the CP, control the access of protein substrates to the catalytic cavity of the CP. Normally, substrate access is auto-inhibited by a closed gate conformation unless regulatory complexes are bound to the CP and translocate protein substrates in an ATP-dependent manner. Here, we provide evidence that Blm10 recognizes pre-activated open gate CPs, which are assumed to exist in an equilibrium with inactive closed gate CP. Consequently, single-capped Blm10-CP shows peptide hydrolysis activity. Under conditions of disturbed CP assembly, as well as in open gate mutants, pre-activated CP or constitutively active CP, respectively, prevail. Then, Blm10 sequesters disordered and open gate CP by forming double-capped Blm10(2)-CP in which peptide hydrolysis activity is repressed. We conclude that Blm10 distinguishes between gate conformations and regulates the activation of CP.
