IL-17-producing T helper cells (Th17) have been recently identified as a previously undescribed subset of helper T cells. Here, we demonstrate that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) has an important regulatory function in the commitment of Th17 cells. Ahr was robustly induced under Th17-polarizing conditions. Ahr-deficient naïve T cells showed a considerable loss in the ability to differentiate into Th17 cells when induced by TGF-beta plus IL-6. We were able to demonstrate that Ahr interacts with Stat1 and Stat5, which negatively regulate Th17 development. Whereas Stat1 activation returned to its basal level in Ahr wild type naïve T cells 24 h after stimulation with TGF-beta plus IL-6, Stat1 remained activated in Ahr-deficient naïve T cells after stimulation. These results indicate that Ahr participates in Th17 cell differentiation through regulating Stat1 activation, a finding that constitutes additional mechanisms in the modulation of Th17 cell development.
