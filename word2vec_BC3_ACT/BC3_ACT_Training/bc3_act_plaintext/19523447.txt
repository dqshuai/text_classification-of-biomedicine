Structural and functional similarities between two bacterial chromosome compacting machineries.

JH Lim, BH Oh

Chromosomes are condensed in all forms of life. SMC-based condensins are the key mediators in this process, but their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Two different condensin complexes have been identified in prokaryotic organisms: MukB-MukE-MukF and SMC-ScpA-ScpB. This review focuses on comparison between the two machineries based on structural, biochemical and other related information in the light of their structure and function.
