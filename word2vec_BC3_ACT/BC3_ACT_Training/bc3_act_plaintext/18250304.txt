Acquisition of additional genetic and/or epigenetic abnormalities other than the BCR/ABL fusion gene is believed to cause disease progression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) from chronic phase to blast crisis (BC). To gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of progression to BC, we screened DNA samples from CML patients during blast transformation for mutations in a number of transcription factor genes that are critical for myeloid-lymphoid development. In 85 cases of CML blast transformation, we identified two new mutations in the coding region of GATA-2, a negative regulator of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell differentiation. A L359V substitution within zinc finger domain (ZF) 2 of GATA-2 was found in eight cases with myelomonoblastic features, whereas an in-frame deletion of 6 aa (delta341-346) spanning the C-terminal border of ZF1 was detected in one patient at myeloid BC with eosinophilia. Further studies indicated that L359V not only increased transactivation activity of GATA-2 but also enhanced its inhibitory effects on the activity of PU.1, a major regulator of myelopoiesis. Consistent with the myelomonoblastic features of CML transformation with the GATA-2 L359V mutant, transduction of the GATA-2 L359V mutant into HL-60 cells or BCR/ABL-harboring murine cells disturbed myelomonocytic differentiation/proliferation in vitro and in vivo, respectively. These data strongly suggest that GATA-2 mutations may play a role in acute myeloid transformation in a subset of CML patients.
