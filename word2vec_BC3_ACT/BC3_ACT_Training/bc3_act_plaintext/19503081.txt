'Injecting' yeast.

D Riveline, P Nurse

Yeast is a powerful genetic model system, but its rigid cell wall has prohibited microinjection. Using microfabricated channels to constrain the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we sheared local regions of individual cells with a piezoelectric unit. The cells remained viable, we detected actin patches in the cell after introduction of fluorescent phalloidin into the medium, and the cytokinetic ring was disrupted after injection of the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin.
