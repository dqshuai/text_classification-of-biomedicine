Miltefosine promotes IFN-gamma-dominated anti-leishmanial immune response.

Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite, resides and replicates as amastigotes within macrophages. The parasite inflicts the disease visceral leishmaniasis by suppressing host cell function. Neither a therapeutic vaccine nor an effective anti-leishmanial drug to reverse the immunosuppression is available. Although miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine or HPC) is a promising orally bioavailable anti-leishmanial drug, its efficacy is seriously compromised by contra-indications in pregnant women. Further rational redesigning of the drug requires studies on its mechanism of action, which is unknown at present. Because miltefosine is proposed to have immunomodulatory functions, we examined whether miltefosine exerts its anti-leishmanial functions by activating macrophages. We observed that miltefosine's anti-leishmanial function was significantly compromised in IFN-gamma-deficient macrophages suggesting the importance of endogenous IFN-gamma in miltefosine-induced anti-leishmanial functions of macrophages. Miltefosine induced IFN-gamma, neutralization of which reduced the anti-leishmanial functions of macrophages. IFN-gamma responsiveness is reduced in L. donovani-infected macrophages but is significantly restored by miltefosine, as it enhances IFN-gamma receptors and IFN-gamma induced STAT-1 phosphorylation but reduced activation of SHP-1, the phosphatase implicated in the down-regulation of STAT-1 phosphorylation. Miltefosine induced protein kinase C-dependent and PI3K-dependent p38MAP kinase phosphorylation and anti-leishmanial function. Miltefosine promotes p38MAP kinase-dependent anti-leishmanial functions and IL-12-dependent Th1 response. Leishmania donovani-infected macrophages induced Th2 response but miltefosine treatment reversed the response to Th1-type. Thus, our data define for the first time the mechanistic basis of host cell-dependent anti-leishmanial function of miltefosine.
