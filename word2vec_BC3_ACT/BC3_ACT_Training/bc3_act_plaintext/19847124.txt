The ER body, a new organelle in Arabidopsis thaliana, requires NAI2 for its formation and accumulates specific beta-glucosidases.

Plants develop various ER-derived structures with specific functions. The ER body found in Arabidopsis thaliana is a spindle-shaped structure. ER bodies accumulate in epidermal cells in seedlings or are induced by wounding. The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the ER body remained obscure. We isolated an ER body-deficient mutant in Arabidopsis seedlings, which we termed nai2. The NAI2 gene encodes a member of a unique protein family. NAI2 localizes to the ER body and the downregulation of NAI2 elongates ER bodies and reduces their number. ER bodies specifically accumulate high levels of PYK10/BGLU23, which is a beta-glucosidase that bears an ER retention signal. Additionally, in the nai2 mutant, PYK10 protein is diffuse throughout the ER and the PYK10 protein level is reduced. These observations indicate that NAI2 is a key factor for the formation of ER bodies and for the accumulation of PYK10 in the ER bodies of Arabidopsis. We also found that BGLU18, which encodes another beta-glucosidase with an ER retention signal, is induced at the site of wounding. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the BGLU18 protein is exclusively localized in ER bodies formed directly at the wounding site of cotyledons. These results suggest that BGLU18 is a component of the ER body in wounded leaves of Arabidopsis.
