Molecular imaging probes have potential for in vivo identification of apoptosis and other intracellular processes. TcapQ, a cell-penetrating, near-infrared fluorescent peptide probe designed to be optically silent through intramolecular fluorescence quenching and activated by effector caspases, has been previously described and validated in vitro. Herein, using NMDA-induced apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), representing an in vivo rat model of glaucoma, we assessed the ability of TcapQ to image single-cell apoptosis through effector caspase activity. Following intravitreal injection, intracellular TcapQ activation occurred specifically in RGCs, identified individual apoptotic cells, showed a clear dose-response relationship with NMDA, and colocalized with TUNEL labeling in the retina. There was a significant diminution of probe activation following pretreatment with a specific inhibitor of caspase-3. Stereospecificity was also exhibited by the lack of intracellular fluorescence upon administration of the noncleavable isomer, dTcapQ. TcapQ has potential utility in detecting and monitoring single-cell apoptosis in glaucoma in vivo.
