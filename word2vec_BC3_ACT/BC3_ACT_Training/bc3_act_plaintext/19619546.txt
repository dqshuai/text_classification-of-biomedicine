Transglutaminase 2 and nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity are correlated in epithelial membranes and are abnormal in cystic fibrosis.

Tissue transglutaminase (tgase2) is a multifunctional enzyme that crosslinks proteins but also acts as a G-protein, differential functions regulated by calcium and GTP. In the epithelial cell membrane, we show that manipulation of tgase2 function by monodansylcadaverine or retinoic acid (RA) alters the activity of a membrane-bound protein kinase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK, nm23-H1/H2) that is known to control G-protein function. We find that NDPK function is abnormally low in cystic fibrosis but can be restored by RA treatment in vitro. Our data suggest that tgase2 is overexpressed in cystic fibrosis and affects NDPK function.
