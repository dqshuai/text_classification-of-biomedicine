Procyanidin oligomers with different degrees of polymerization (up to nonamers) were efficiently purified from the bark of Jatoba (Hymenaea courbaril) by using a recently developed chromatographic separation method. Purification relied on a hydrogen bonding interaction between phenolic hydroxyl groups of the procyanidins and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated resin in a packed column. The individual procyanidins were identified by using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and verified by a thiolytic degradation analysis. Our results demonstrate that Jatoba bark contained a large amount of procyanidins from monomer to nonamers or higher polymers composed of only B-type linked units (flavan-3-ol units linked through C-4 to C-8 (or C-6)) of epicatechin (EC) without gallate esters.
