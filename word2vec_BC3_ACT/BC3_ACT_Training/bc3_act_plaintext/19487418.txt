Tracking the culprit: HIV-1 evolution and immune selection revealed by single-genome amplification.

ZL Brumme, BD Walker

Early control of HIV-1 infection is determined by a balance between the host immune response and the ability of the virus to escape this response. Studies using single-genome amplification now reveal new details about the kinetics and specificity of the CD8(+) T cell response and the evolution of the virus during early HIV infection.
