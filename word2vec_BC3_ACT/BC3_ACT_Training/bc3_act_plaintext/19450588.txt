Thermodynamics and kinetics for base pair opening in the DNA decamer duplexes containing cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer.

The cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) is one of the major classes of cytotoxic and carcinogenic DNA photoproducts induced by UV light. Hydrogen exchange rates of the imino protons were measured for various CPD-containing DNA duplexes to better understand the mechanism for CPD recognition by XPC-hHR23B. The results here revealed that double T.G mismatches in a CPD lesion significantly destabilized six consecutive base pairs compared to other DNA duplexes. This flexibility in a DNA duplex caused at the CPD lesions with double T.G mismatches might be the key factor for damage recognition by XPC-hHR23B.
