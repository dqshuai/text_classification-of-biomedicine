A series of novel imidazoline derivatives was synthesized and evaluated as neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y5 receptor antagonists. Optimization of previously reported imidazoline leads, 1a and 1b, was attempted by introduction of substituents at the 5-position on the imidazoline ring and modification of the bis(4-fluorphenyl) moiety. A number of potent derivatives without human ether-a-go-go related gene potassium channel (hERG) activity were identified. Selected compounds, including 2a, were shown to have excellent brain and CSF permeability. Compound 2a displayed a suitable pharmacokinetic profile for chronic in vivo studies and potently inhibited D-Trp(34)NPY-induced acute food intake in rats. Oral administration of 2a resulted in a potent reduction of body weight in a diet-induced obese mouse model.
