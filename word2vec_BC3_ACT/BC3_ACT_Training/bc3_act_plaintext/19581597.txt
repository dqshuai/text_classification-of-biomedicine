Expression of immediate-early genes reveals functional compartments within ocular dominance columns after brief monocular inactivation.

Visual inputs from the 2 eyes in most primates activate alternating bands of cortex in layer 4C of primary visual cortex, thereby forming the well-studied ocular dominance columns (ODCs). In addition, the enzymatic reactivity of cytochrome oxidase (CO) reveals "blob" structures within the supragranular layers of ODCs. Here, we present evidence for compartments within ODCs that have not been clearly defined previously. These compartments are revealed by the activity-dependent mRNA expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs), zif268 and c-fos, after brief periods of monocular inactivation (MI). After a 1-3-h period of MI produced by an injection of tetrodotoxin, IEGs were expressed in a patchy pattern that included infragranular layers, as well as supragranular layers, where they corresponded to the CO blobs. In addition, the expressions of IEGs in layer 4C were especially high in narrow zones along boundaries of ODCs, referred to here as the "border strips" of the ODCs. After longer periods of MI (>5 h), the border strips were no longer apparent. When either eyelid was sutured, changes in IEG expression were not evident in layer 4C; however, the patchy pattern of the expression in the infragranular and supragranular layers remained. These changes of IEG expression after MI indicate that cortical circuits involving the CO blobs of the supragranular layers include aligned groups of neurons in the infragranular layers and that the border strip neurons of layer 4C are highly active for a 3-h period after MI.
