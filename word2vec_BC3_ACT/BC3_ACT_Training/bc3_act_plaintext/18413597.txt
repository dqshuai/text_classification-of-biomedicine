Adenovirus E1A drives oncogenesis by targeting key regulatory pathways that are critical for cellular growth control. The interaction of E1A with p400 is essential for many E1A activities, but the downstream target of this interaction is unknown. Here, we present evidence that the oncoprotein transcription factor Myc is the target of this interaction. We show that E1A stabilizes Myc protein via p400 and promotes the coassociation of Myc and p400 at Myc target genes, leading to their transcriptional induction. We also show that E1A requires Myc for its ability to activate Myc-dependent gene expression and induce apoptosis, and that forced expression of Myc is sufficient to rescue the activity of an E1A-mutant defective in p400 binding. Together, these findings establish that Myc, via p400, is an essential downstream target of E1A.
