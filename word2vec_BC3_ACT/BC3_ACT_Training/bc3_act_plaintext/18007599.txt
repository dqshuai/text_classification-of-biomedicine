In the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) play important roles as intermediates. Primary siRNAs are produced from trigger dsRNAs by an RNaseIII-related enzyme called Dicer; in some organisms, secondary siRNAs are also produced by processes involving RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs), which act on target mRNAs. Using a cell-free assay system prepared from Caenorhabditis elegans, we analyzed the production and activity of secondary siRNAs. In this cell-free system, RdRP activity acts on mRNA-derived templates to produce small RNAs. The RRF-1 complex is predominantly responsible for the RdRP activity, and synthesizes secondary-type siRNA molecules in a Dicer-independent manner. Notably, secondary-type siRNAs induce a prominent Slicer activity to cleave target mRNAs far more effectively than primary-type siRNAs. An Argonaute protein, CSR-1, is responsible for the Slicer activity induced by secondary-type siRNAs. Secondary rather than primary siRNAs may play a major role in the destabilization of target transcripts during RNAi in C. elegans.
