A variety of novel syn-2-alkoxy-3-amino-3-arylpropan-1-ols was prepared through LiAlH(4)-promoted reductive ring-opening of cis-3-alkoxy-4-aryl-beta-lactams in Et(2)O. The latter gamma-aminoalcohols were easily converted into cis-5-alkoxy-4-aryl-1,3-oxazinanes using formaldehyde in THF. Both series of compounds were evaluated against a chloroquine sensitive strain of Plasmodium falciparum (D10), revealing micromolar potency for almost all representatives. Eleven compounds exhibited antimalarial activity with IC(50) values of <or=30 microM, and the majority of these compounds did not show cytotoxicity at the concentrations tested.
