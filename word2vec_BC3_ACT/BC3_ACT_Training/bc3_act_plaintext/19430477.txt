Little is known of how and where bacterial recognition triggers the induction of type I interferon. Whether the type of recognition receptor used in these responses is determined by the subcellular location of bacteria is not understood. Here we show that phagosomal bacteria such as group B streptococcus, but not cytosolic bacteria, potently induced interferon in conventional dendritic cells by a mechanism that required Toll-like receptor 7, the adaptor MyD88 and the transcription factor IRF1, all of which localized together with bacterial products in degradative vacuoles bearing lysosomal markers. Thus, this cell type-specific recognition pathway links lysosomal recognition of bacterial RNA with a robust, host-protective interferon response.
