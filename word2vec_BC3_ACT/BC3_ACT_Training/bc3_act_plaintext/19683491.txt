PCI complexes: Beyond the proteasome, CSN, and eIF3 Troika.

E Pick, K Hofmann, MH Glickman

The bipartite PCI domain serves as the principal scaffold for proteasome lid, CSN, and eIF3, complexes that influence protein life span. PCI domains are also found in newly identified complexes directing nucleic acid regulation. The breadth of functions associated with the extended PCI family is a factor of shared subunits, among them a common factor Sem1/DSS1 that facilitates complex assembly.
