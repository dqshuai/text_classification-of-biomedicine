We created a protein library consisting of 647 Arabidopsis transcription factors (TFs) using a wheat cell-free system. The quality of proteins in the library was checked by binding assay of bZIP family proteins. Screening of TFs binding to 5'-regulatory regions of FLC and LFY was conducted using the library, and MYB67 and GBF1 were found to be binding factors.
