AIM: To identify multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) features most predictive of serous cystadenomas (SCAs), correlating with histopathology, and to study the impact of cyst size and MDCT technique on reader performance. METHODS: The MDCT scans of 164 patients with surgically verified pancreatic cystic lesions were reviewed by two readers to study the predictive value of various morphological features for establishing a diagnosis of SCAs. Accuracy in lesion characterization and reader confidence were correlated with lesion size (<or= 3 cm or >or= 3 cm) and scanning protocols (dedicated vs routine). RESULTS: 28/164 cysts (mean size, 39 mm; range, 8-92 mm) were diagnosed as SCA on pathology. The MDCT features predictive of diagnosis of SCA were microcystic appearance (22/28, 78.6%), surface lobulations (25/28, 89.3%) and central scar (9/28, 32.4%). Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that only microcystic appearance was significant for CT diagnosis of SCA (P = 0.0001). The sensitivity, specificity and PPV of central scar and of combined microcystic appearance and lobulations were 32.4%/100%/100% and 68%/100%/100%, respectively. The reader confidence was higher for lesions > 3 cm (P = 0.02) and for MDCT scans performed using thin collimation (1.25-2.5 mm) compared to routine 5 mm collimation exams (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Central scar on MDCT is diagnostic of SCA but is seen in only one third of SCAs. Microcystic morphology is the most significant CT feature in diagnosis of SCA. A combination of microcystic appearance and surface lobulations offers accuracy comparable to central scar with higher sensitivity.
