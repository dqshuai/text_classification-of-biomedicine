Escape behaviour: reciprocal inhibition ensures effective escape trajectory.

KT Sillar

When a zebrafish makes a fast escape response, Mauthner cells directly activate contralateral spinal interneurons which feed reciprocal inhibition to motorneurons on the stimulated side. Ablation of these interneurons in transgenic animals impairs escape responses, indicating their crucial role in survival.
