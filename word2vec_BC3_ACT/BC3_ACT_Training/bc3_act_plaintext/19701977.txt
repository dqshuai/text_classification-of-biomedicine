Combined hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinoma (cHCC-CC) is a rare tumor type containing unequivocal elements of both hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma that are intimately mixed. Although these tumors are usually considered to be more related to hepatocellular carcinoma than to cholangiocarcinoma, they sometimes, in contrast to hepatocellular carcinoma, contain a significant amount of fibrous stroma. This might in some cases explain atypical radiological features. We report a case of a cHCC-CC in a 47-year-old female that resembled focal nodular hyperplasia on Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Correlation of imaging and serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein and CA19.9 can help to make the correct diagnosis preoperatively.
