Fast and simple acquisition of solid-state 14N NMR spectra with signal enhancement via population transfer.

LA O'Dell, RW Schurko

A new approach for the acquisition of static, wideline (14)N NMR powder patterns is outlined. The method involves the use of frequency-swept pulses which serve two simultaneous functions: (1) broad-band excitation of magnetization and (2) signal enhancement via population transfer. The signal enhancement mechanism is described using numerical simulations and confirmed experimentally. This approach, which we call DEISM (Direct Enhancement of Integer Spin Magnetization), allows high-quality (14)N spectra to be acquired at intermediate field strengths in an uncomplicated way and in a fraction of the time required for previously reported methods.
