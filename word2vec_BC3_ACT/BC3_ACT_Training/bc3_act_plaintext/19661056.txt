The spatial organization of Ras proteins into nanoclusters on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is essential for high fidelity signaling through the MAPK pathway. Here we identify two selective regulators of K-Ras nanoclustering from a proteomic screen for K-Ras interacting proteins. Nucleophosmin (NPM) and nucleolin are predominantly localized to the nucleolus but also have extranuclear functions. We show that a subset of NPM and nucleolin localizes to the inner leaflet of plasma membrane and forms specific complexes with K-Ras but not other Ras isoforms. Active GTP-loaded and inactive GDP-loaded K-Ras both interact with NPM, although NPM-K-Ras binding is increased by growth factor receptor activation. NPM and nucleolin both stabilize K-Ras levels on the plasma membrane, but NPM concurrently increases the clustered fraction of GTP-K-Ras. The increase in nanoclustered GTP-K-Ras in turn enhances signal gain in the MAPK pathway. In summary these results reveal novel extranucleolar functions for NPM and nucleolin as regulators of K-Ras nanocluster formation and activation of the MAPK pathway. The study also identifies a new class of K-Ras nanocluster regulator that operates independently of the structural scaffold galectin-3.
