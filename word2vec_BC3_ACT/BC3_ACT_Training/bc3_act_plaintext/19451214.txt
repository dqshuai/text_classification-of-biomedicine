Initiating chromosome replication in E. coli: it makes sense to recycle.

AC Leonard, JE Grimwade

Initiating new rounds of Escherichia coli chromosome replication requires DnaA-ATP to unwind the replication origin, oriC, and load DNA helicase. In this issue of Genes & Development, Fujimitsu and colleagues (pp. 1221-1233) demonstrate that two chromosomal sites, termed DARS (DnaA-reactivating sequences), recycle inactive DnaA-ADP into DnaA-ATP. Fujimitsu and colleagues propose these sites are necessary to attain the DnaA-ATP threshold during normal growth and are important regulators of initiation timing in bacteria.
