Functional conversion of fatty acyl-CoA synthetase to firefly luciferase by site-directed mutagenesis: a key substitution responsible for luminescence activity.

We demonstrated that firefly luciferase has a catalytic function of fatty acyl-CoA synthesis [Oba, Y., Ojika, M. and Inouye, S. (2003) Firefly luciferase is a bifunctional enzyme: ATP-dependent monooxygenase and a long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase. FEBS Lett. 540, 251-254] and proposed that the evolutionary origin of beetle luciferase is a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (FACS) in insect. In this study, we performed the functional conversion of FACS to luciferase by replacing a single amino acid to serine. This serine residue is conserved in luciferases and possibly interacts with luciferin. The mutants of FACSs in non-luminous click beetle Agrypnus binodulus (AbLL) and Drosophila melanogaster (CG6178) gave luminescence enhancement, suggesting that the serine residue is a key substitution responsible for luminescence activity.
