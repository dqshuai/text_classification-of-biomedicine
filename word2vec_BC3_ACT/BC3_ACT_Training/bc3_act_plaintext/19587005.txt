We studied the factors that control IL-17 production in human Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. CD4(+) cells from healthy tuberculin reactors produced IL-17 in response to autologous M. tuberculosis-stimulated monocytes, and most IL-17(+) cells were Ag experienced, CD4(+)CD62L(-). IL-17 production by CD4(+) cells was inhibited by anti-IL-23, but not by Abs to IL-1, IL-6, or TGF-beta. Anti-NKG2D reduced IL-17 production and the frequency of CD4(+)CD62(-) IL-17(+) cells, suggesting that NKG2D stimulates IL-17 production. CD4(+)NKG2D(+) cells did not produce IL-17. Monocytes and alveolar macrophages from healthy donors produced IL-23 in response to M. tuberculosis. Addition of CD4(+) cells markedly enhanced IL-23 production by M. tuberculosis-stimulated monocytes, and this was inhibited by anti-NKG2D and by Abs to UL-16 binding protein (ULB)1, a ligand for NKG2D on APCs. We conclude that binding of NKG2D to UL-16 binding protein (ULB)1 contributes to IL-23-dependent IL-17 production by CD4(+) cells in human M. tuberculosis infection.
