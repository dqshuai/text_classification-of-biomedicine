Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a multifunctional transmembrane protein which has a short cytoplasmic region with no particular functional domain, and is considered to act as a co-receptor for both VEGFs and semaphorins. However, the molecular mechanisms by which NRP1 carries out such versatile functions are still poorly understood. Here we identified protein kinase CK2 holoenzyme as a novel NRP1 binding protein by our combined purification strategy using epitope-tag immunoprecipitation followed by reverse-phase column chromatography. Further we showed that CK2 binds to the extracellular domain of NRP1 which is also phosphorylated by CK2 both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings of novel molecular interactions and modification of NRP1 may provide a new clue to understand the diverse functions of NRP1.
