Cardiotrophin-1 maintains the undifferentiated state in skeletal myoblasts.

Skeletal myogenesis is potently regulated by the extracellular milieu of growth factors and cytokines. We observed that cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), a member of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines, is a potent regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation. The normal up-regulation of myogenic marker genes, myosin heavy chain (MyHC), myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), and myocyte enhancer factor 2s (MEF2s) were inhibited by CT-1 treatment. CT-1 also represses myogenin (MyoG) promoter activation. CT-1 activated two signaling pathways: signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), a component of the extracellular signal-regulated MAPK (ERK) pathway. In view of the known connection between CT-1 and STAT3 activation, we surprisingly found that pharmacological blockade of STAT3 activity had no effect on the inhibition of myogenesis by CT-1 suggesting that STAT3 signaling is dispensable for myogenic repression. Conversely, MEK inhibition potently reversed the inhibition of myotube formation and attenuated the repression of MRF transcriptional activity mediated by CT-1. Taken together, these data indicate that CT-1 represses skeletal myogenesis through interference with MRF activity by activation of MEK/ERK signaling. In agreement with these in vitro observations, exogenous systemic expression of CT-1 mediated by adenoviral vector delivery increased the number of myonuclei in normal post-natal mouse skeletal muscle and also delayed skeletal muscle regeneration induced by cardiotoxin injection. The expression pattern of CT-1 in embryonic and post-natal skeletal muscle and in vivo effects of CT-1 on myogenesis implicate CT-1 in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state in muscle progenitor cells.
