Lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3) is a multifunctional enzyme possessing lysyl hydroxylase, collagen galactosyltransferase, and glucosyltransferase (GGT) activities. We report here an important role for LH3 in the organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cytoskeleton. Deposition of ECM was affected in heterozygous LH3 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF(+/-)) and in skin fibroblasts collected from a member of a Finnish epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) family known to be deficient in GGT activity. We show the GGT deficiency to be due to a transcriptional defect in one LH3 allele. The ECM abnormalities also lead to defects in the arrangement of the cytoskeleton in both cell lines. Ultrastructural abnormalities were observed in the skin of heterozygous LH3 knock-out mice indicating that even a moderate decrease in LH3 has deleterious consequences in vivo. The LH3 null allele in the EBS family member and the resulting abnormalities in the organization of the extracellular matrix, similar to those found in MEF(+/-), may explain the correlation between the severity of the phenotype and the decrease in GGT activity reported in this family.
