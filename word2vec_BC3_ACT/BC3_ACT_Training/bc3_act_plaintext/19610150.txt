We report a rare case of a 74-year-old man with metachronous gallbladder cancer and bile duct cancer who underwent curative resection twice, with the operations nine years apart. At the age of 65 years, the patient underwent a cholecystectomy and resection of the liver bed for gallbladder cancer. This was a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, with negative resection margins (T2N0M0, stage IB). Nine years later, during a follow-up examination, abdominal computed tomography and MRCP showed an enhanced 1.7 cm mass in the hilum that extended to the second branch of the right intrahepatic bile duct. We diagnosed this lesion as a perihilar bile duct cancer, Bismuth type IIIa, and performed bile duct excision, right hepatic lobectomy and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. The histological diagnosis was a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with one regional lymph node metastasis (T1N1M0, stage IIB). Twelve months after the second operation, the patient is well, with no signs of recurrence. This case is compared with 11 other cases of metachronous biliary tract cancer published in the world medical literature.
