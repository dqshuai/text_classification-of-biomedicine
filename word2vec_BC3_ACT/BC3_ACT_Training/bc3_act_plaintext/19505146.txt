Hydrogen sulfide gravimetric isotherm adsorption measurements were carried out on MIL-53(Al, Cr, Fe), MIL-47(V), MIL-100(Cr), and MIL-101(Cr) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). A two-step adsorption mechanism related to a breathing effect was observed for MIL-53 terephthalate-based MOFs. Methane adsorption measurements highlighted the regenerability of MIL-53(Al, Cr) and MIL-47(V) MOFs after H(2)S treatment, whereas MIL-100 and MIL-101 CH(4) adsorption capacities were significantly decreased.
