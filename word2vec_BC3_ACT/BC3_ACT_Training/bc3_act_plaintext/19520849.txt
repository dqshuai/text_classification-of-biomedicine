Role of pICLn in methylation of Sm proteins by PRMT5.

GS Pesiridis, E Diamond, GD Van Duyne

pICln is an essential, highly conserved 26-kDa protein whose functions include binding to Sm proteins in the cytoplasm of human cells and mediating the ordered and regulated assembly of the cell's RNA-splicing machinery by the survival motor neurons complex. pICln also interacts with PRMT5, the enzyme responsible for generating symmetric dimethylarginine modifications on the carboxyl-terminal regions of three of the canonical Sm proteins. To better understand the role of pICln in these cellular processes, we have investigated the properties of pICln and pICln.Sm complexes and the effects that pICln has on the methyltransferase activity of PRMT5. We find that pICln is a monomer in solution, binds with high affinity (K(d) approximately 160 nm) to SmD3-SmB, and forms 1:1 complexes with Sm proteins and Sm protein subcomplexes. The data support an end-capping model of pICln binding that supports current views of how pICln prevents Sm oligomerization on illicit RNA substrates. We have found that by co-expression with pICln, recombinant PRMT5 can be produced in a soluble, active form. PRMT5 alone has promiscuous activity toward a variety of known substrates. In the presence of pICln, however, PRMT5 methylation of Sm proteins is stimulated, but methylation of histones is inhibited. We have also found that mutations in pICln that do not affect Sm protein binding can still have a profound effect on the methyltransferase activity of the PRMT5 complex. Together, the data provide insights into pICln function and represent an important starting point for biochemical analyses of PRMT5.
