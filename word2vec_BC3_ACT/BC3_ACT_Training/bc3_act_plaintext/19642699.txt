Calixarene-capped Co(32) clusters are constructed by a sodalite Co(II)(24) cage and an encapsulated Co(III)(8) cube. The spherical units are arranged into three isomeric structures, two of which are stacked by the bcc lattices and the third of which is assembled by the cubic closest packing of the spherical units.
