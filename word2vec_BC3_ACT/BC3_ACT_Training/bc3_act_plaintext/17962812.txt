Ligand-independent activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 by low-density lipoprotein.

Elevated serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is a risk factor for atherosclerotic disorders. However, prominent atherosclerosis, which has been observed in LDL receptor (LDLR)-knockout mice, has diminished the significance of LDLR as a cause of atherosclerosis, while elaborate studies have focused on the receptors for denatured LDL. Here we report that native LDL (nLDL) activates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 1 (VEGFR1) but not VEGFR2 through LDLR and is as potent as VEGF in macrophage migration. Binding and co-endocytosis of VEGFR1 and LDLR were enhanced by nLDL, which is concomitant with ubiquitination-mediated degradation of VEGFR1. We propose that LDLR-mediated use of VEGFR1 by nLDL could be a potential therapeutic target in atherosclerotic disorders.
