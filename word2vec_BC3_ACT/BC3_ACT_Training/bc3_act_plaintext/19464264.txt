Intriguing similarities between two novel odorant-binding proteins of locusts.

Two novel odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) of locust, LmigOBP2 and LmigOBP3 are very different from each other and from the previously reported LmigOBP1 in their amino acid sequences. Moreover, OBP3 contains three additional cysteines, a fact not previously recorded in standard length OBPs. However, these two proteins exhibit remarkably similar binding affinities to a set of organic compounds. Such behaviour is supported by three-dimensional models, showing very similar folding for LmigOBP2 and LmigOBP3, but clearly different for LmigOBP1. Also several amino acid residues lining the binding pockets of the three proteins appear conserved in LmigOBP2 and LmigOBP3, but not in LmigOBP1. Western blot experiments revealed the presence of LmigOBP2 in antennae, mouth parts and cerci, but could not detected LmigOBP3 in any of these tissues. In immunocytochemistry, antibodies against LmigOBP2 strongly stained the outer lymph of sensilla chaetica of the antennae, in contrast with LmigOBP1, previously reported in sensilla basiconica.
