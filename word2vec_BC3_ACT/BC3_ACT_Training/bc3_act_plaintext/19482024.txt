High-fat diet induced adiposity and insulin resistance in mice lacking the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase.

Myotonic dystrophy 1 (MD1) is caused by a CTG expansion in the 3'-unstranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene. MD1 patients frequently present insulin resistance and increased visceral adiposity. We examined whether DMPK deficiency is a genetic risk factor for high-fat diet-induced adiposity and insulin resistance using the DMPK knockout mouse model. We found that high-fat fed DMPK knockout mice had significantly increased body weights, hypertrophic adipocytes and whole-body insulin resistance compared with wild-type mice. This nutrient-genome interaction should be considered by physicians given the cardiometabolic risks and sedentary lifestyle associated with MD1 patients.
