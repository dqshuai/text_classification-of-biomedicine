A series of novel pyridyl analogues 1-18 of antiprotozoal drug 1,5-bis(4-amidinophenoxy)pentane (pentamidine) has been synthesized and tested for in vitro activities against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, Plasmodium falciparum, and Leishmania donovani, and for cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. Antiprotozoal properties of compounds 1-18 depended on the placement of cationic moieties on the pyridine rings as well as the nature of substituents on the amidine groups. Diamidine 6 with cationic moieties adjacent to pyridine nitrogen atoms was the most promising compound in the series showing superior in vitro activities against T. brucei rhodesiense, P. falciparum, and L. donovani compared to pentamidine. An oral prodrug of diamidine 6, diamidoxime 9, administered at 25 mg/kg daily for 4 days, exhibited excellent antitrypanosomal efficacy in vivo curing all infected animals in the STIB900 acute mouse model of trypanosomiasis.
