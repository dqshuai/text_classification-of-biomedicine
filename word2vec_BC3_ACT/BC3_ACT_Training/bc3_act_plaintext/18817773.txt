Plants use sugars as signaling molecules and possess mechanisms to detect and respond to changes in sugar availability, ranging from the level of secondary signaling molecules to altered gene transcription. G-protein-coupled pathways are involved in sugar signaling in plants. The Arabidopsis thaliana regulator of G-protein signaling protein 1 (AtRGS1) combines a receptor-like seven transmembrane domain with an RGS domain, interacts with the Arabidopsis Galpha subunit (AtGPA1) in a d-glucose-regulated manner, and stimulates AtGPA1 GTPase activity. We determined that AtRGS1 interacts with additional components, genetically defined here, to serve as a plasma membrane sensor for d-glucose. This interaction between AtRGS1 and AtGPA1 involves, in part, the seven-transmembrane domain of AtRGS1.
