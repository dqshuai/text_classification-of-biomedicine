Heparin-induced circular dichroism of chloroquine.

FE Stanley, AM Warner, SM Gutierrez, AM Stalcup

Circular dichroism (CD) and UV/Visible absorption (UV/Vis) spectroscopy techniques were used to investigate the interaction between heparin and chloroquine, an antimalarial drug that has shown potential as an anti-prion agent. CD spectra of rac-chloroquine upon addition of heparin provide evidence of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding, support recent findings suggesting that interactions between heparin and antimalarial drugs are largely due to electrostatic interactions, and represent the first reported GAG-induced CD signal of a bicyclic, aromatic compound. The association constant ( approximately 10(3)M(-1)) between chloroquine and heparin was calculated from a UV titration curve and provided additional insight into the nature of the association between these two compounds.
