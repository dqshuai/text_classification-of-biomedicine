MouseCyc: a curated biochemical pathways database for the laboratory mouse.

AV Evsikov, ME Dolan, MP Genrich, E Patek, CJ Bult

Linking biochemical genetic data to the reference genome for the laboratory mouse is important for comparative physiology and for developing mouse models of human biology and disease. We describe here a new database of curated metabolic pathways for the laboratory mouse called MouseCyc http://mousecyc.jax.org. MouseCyc has been integrated with genetic and genomic data for the laboratory mouse available from the Mouse Genome Informatics database and with pathway data from other organisms, including human.
