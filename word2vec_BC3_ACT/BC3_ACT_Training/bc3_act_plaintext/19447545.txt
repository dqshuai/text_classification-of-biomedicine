Chimeric adenoviral vectors possessing fiber derived from human adenovirus subgroup B (Ad35) have been developed for their high infection efficiency in cell types which are refractory to adenovirus serotype 5 (Subgroup C). The present study constructed an E1B-deleted chimeric oncolytic adenovirus, SG235-TRAIL, which carries a human TRAIL gene expression cassette and whose fiber shaft and knob domains are from serotype Ad35. It was found that SG235-TRAIL preferentially replicated in gastric cancer cell lines, SGC-7901 and BGC-823 compared to in normal human fibroblast BJ cells. Also, when compared with a replication-deficient chimeric vector Ad5/35-TRAIL, SG235-TRAIL mediated a higher level of the transgene expression via viral replication in the cancer cells. Further, because of the more efficient cell-entry and infection, SG235-TRAIL induced stronger cell apoptosis than the Ad5 CRAD vector, ZD55-TRAIL. In addition, SG235-TRAIL in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug, taxol, produced a synergistic cytotoxic effect in cancer cells in vitro without causing significant toxicity to normal cells. In the gastric tumor xenograft mouse model, intratumoral SG235-TRAIL injection produced a significant antitumor effect 14 days after treatment. Pathological examination demonstrated TRAIL expression and associated apoptosis in majority of SG235-TRAIL-treated tumor cells. These results suggest that SG235-TRAIL is a potential novel, efficient anti-cancer agent, and in combination with taxol, it would be even more useful with considerably low toxic side effects.
