Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium elicits acute neutrophil influx in the human intestinal mucosa within 1 or 2 days after infection, resulting in inflammatory diarrhea. In contrast, no overt symptoms are observed within the first 1 or 2 weeks after infection with S. enterica serotype Typhi. Here we show that introduction of the capsule-encoding viaB locus of serotype Typhi reduced the ability of serotype Typhimurium to elicit acute intestinal inflammation in a streptomycin-pretreated mouse model. Serotype Typhimurium requires a functional invasion-associated type III secretion system (type III secretion system 1 [T3SS-1]) to elicit cecal inflammation within 48 h after infection of streptomycin-pretreated mice, and the presence of the viaB locus reduced its invasiveness for human intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. However, a reduced activity of T3SS-1 could not account for the ability of the viaB locus to attenuate cecal inflammation, because introduction of the viaB locus into an invasion-deficient serotype Typhimurium strain (invA mutant) resulted in a significant reduction of pathology and inflammatory cytokine expression in the cecum 5 days after infection of mice. We conclude that a T3SS-1-independent mechanism contributes to the ability of the viaB locus to reduce intestinal inflammation.
