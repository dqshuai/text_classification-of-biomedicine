Sulfatases are unique in requiring an essential post-translational modification of a critical active-site cysteinyl or seryl residue to 3-oxoalanine usually called C alpha-formylglycine (FGly). This post-translational modification is catalyzed anaerobically by anaerobic Sulfatase Maturating Enzyme (anSME), a member of the radical AdoMet superfamily. Using a new labeled substrate, we demonstrate that anSME uses a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical to catalyze direct H-atom abstraction from the substrate. We thus established that anSMEs are the first radical AdoMet enzymes catalyzing a post-translational modification involving C(beta) H-atom abstraction from an active site cysteinyl or seryl residue. This mechanistic study allowed us to decipher the first steps of the mechanism of this new radical AdoMet enzyme family.
