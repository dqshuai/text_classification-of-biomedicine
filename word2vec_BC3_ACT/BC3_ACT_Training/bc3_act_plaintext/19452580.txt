AIM: To investigate the pattern of mucin expression and concentration in bile obtained during endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) in relation to gallstone disease. METHODS: Bile samples obtained at ERC from 29 consecutive patients, 17 with and 12 without gallstone disease were evaluated for mucin content by gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-4B column. Dot blot analysis for bile mucin apoproteins was performed with antibodies to Mucin 1 (MUC1), MUC2, MUC3, MUC5AC, MUC5B and MUC6. Staining intensity score (0-3) was used as a measure of antigen expression. RESULTS: MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC5AC, MUC5B and MUC6 were demonstrated in 34.4%, 34.4%, 51.7%, 51.7%, 55.1% and 27.5% of bile samples, respectively. The staining intensity scores were 0.62 +/- 0.94, 0.58 +/- 0.90, 0.79 +/- 0.97, 1.06 +/- 1.22, 1.20 +/- 1.26 and 0.41 +/- 0.73, respectively. Mean mucin concentration measured in bile by the Sepharose CL-4B method was 22.8 +/- 24.0 mg/mL (range 3.4-89.0 mg/mL). Mean protein concentration was 8.1 +/- 4.8 mg/mL (range 1.7-23.2 mg/mL). CONCLUSION: High levels of MUC3, MUC5AC and MUC5B are expressed in bile aspirated during ERC examination. A specific pattern of mucin gene expression or change in mucin concentration was not found in gallstone disease.
