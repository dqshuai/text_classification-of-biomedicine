Traction stresses and translational distortion of the nucleus during fibroblast migration on a physiologically relevant ECM mimic.

Cellular traction forces, resulting in cell-substrate physical interactions, are generated by actin-myosin complexes and transmitted to the extracellular matrix through focal adhesions. These processes are highly dynamic under physiological conditions and modulate cell migration. To better understand the precise dynamics of cell migration, we measured the spatiotemporal redistribution of cellular traction stresses (force per area) during fibroblast migration at a submicron level and correlated it with nuclear translocation, an indicator of cell migration, on a physiologically relevant extracellular matrix mimic. We found that nuclear translocation occurred in pulses whose magnitude was larger on the low ligand density surfaces than on the high ligand density surfaces. Large nuclear translocations only occurred on low ligand density surfaces when the rear traction stresses completely relocated to a posterior nuclear location, whereas such relocation took much longer time on high ligand density surfaces, probably due to the greater magnitude of traction stresses. Nuclear distortion was also observed as the traction stresses redistributed. Our results suggest that the reinforcement of the traction stresses around the nucleus as well as the relaxation of nuclear deformation are critical steps during fibroblast migration, serving as a speed regulator, which must be considered in any dynamic molecular reconstruction model of tissue cell migration. A traction gradient foreshortening model was proposed to explain how the relocation of rear traction stresses leads to pulsed fibroblast migration.
