Second messenger signaling: multiple receptors for NAADP.

AH Guse

The second messenger NAADP appears to have an essential role as a universal trigger of Ca(2+) signaling. Following on from previously published NAADP receptor candidates, recent work now describes the identification of a novel NAADP-sensitive Ca(2+) channel.
