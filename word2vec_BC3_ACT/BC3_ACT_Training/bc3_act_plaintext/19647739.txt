Adipocytes play important roles in lipid metabolism but also in the control of inflammatory processes. Based on our previous findings of heat shock protein (Hsp) 60-induced activation of preadipocytes we investigated whether the capacity of heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) to interact with adipocytes and to stimulate their proinflammatory activity is determined by the differentiation state of the cells. Hsp60 bound to adipocytes and stimulated the release of inflammatory mediators independent of their differentiation state. Hsp60-adipocyte interactions revealed basic characteristics of a receptor-mediated process. Our findings characterize Hsp60 binding and Hsp60-induced release of proinflammatory mediators as fundamental properties of adipocytes independent of their differentiation state.
