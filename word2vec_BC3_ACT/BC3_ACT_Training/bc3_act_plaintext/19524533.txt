RVB1/RVB2: running rings around molecular biology.

S Jha, A Dutta

RVB1/RVB2 (also known as Pontin/Reptin, TIP49/TIP48, RuvbL1/RuvbL2, ECP54/ECP51, INO80H/INO80J, TIH1/TIH2, and TIP49A/TIP49B) are two highly conserved members of the AAA+ family that are present in different protein and nucleoprotein complexes. Recent studies implicate the RVB-containing complexes in many cellular processes such as transcription, DNA damage response, snoRNP assembly, cellular transformation, and cancer metastasis. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of RVB-containing complexes and their role in these pathways.
