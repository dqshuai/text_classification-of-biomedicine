The chemically modified thanatins with the methyl group (CH(3)), ethyl group (C(2)H(5)), and normal-octyl group (C(8)H(17)) at the side-chain of cysteine residues were synthesized. The octyl group modified form exhibited 8-fold higher antimicrobial activity against Micrococcus luteus than wild type thanatin. It was found that there was an equilateral correlation between antimicrobial activity and side-chain hydrophobicity at the cysteine residues in thanatin.
