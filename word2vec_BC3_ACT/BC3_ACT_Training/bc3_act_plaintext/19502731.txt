Grape seed proanthocyanidin extracts (GSPEs) have been reported to be effective in treating arteriosclerosis, while little is known about therapeutic agents against diabetic macrovascular complications. We used streptozocin to induce diabetic rats. GSPEs (250 mg/kg of body weight) were administrated to diabetic rats for 24 weeks. Aortic blood pressure and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were determined in anesthetized rats. Serum glycated hemoglobin and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were determined. An electronic microscope was used to observe the changes in aortic ultrastructure. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the receptor of advanced glycation end product (RAGE) protein expression in aortic tissue. GSPEs significantly decreased aortic PWV, blood pressure, and aortic medial thickness (P<0.05), and inhibited the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. GSPEs significantly reduced the AGEs (P<0.05) and the expression of RAGE in aortas of diabetic rats. GSPEs play an important role against diabetic macrovascular complications. This study may provide a new recognition of natural medicine for the treatment of diabetic macrovascular complications.
