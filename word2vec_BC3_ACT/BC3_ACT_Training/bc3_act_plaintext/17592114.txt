Zebrafish Csrp1 is a member of the cysteine- and glycine-rich protein (CSRP) family and is expressed in the mesendoderm and its derivatives. Csrp1 interacts with Dishevelled 2 (Dvl2) and Diversin (Div), which control cell morphology and other dynamic cell behaviors via the noncanonical Wnt and JNK pathways. When csrp1 message is knocked down, abnormal convergent extension cell movement is induced, resulting in severe deformities in midline structures. In addition, cardiac bifida is induced as a consequence of defects in cardiac mesoderm cell migration. Our data highlight Csrp1 as a key molecule of the noncanonical Wnt pathway, which orchestrates cell behaviors during dynamic morphogenetic movements of tissues and organs.
