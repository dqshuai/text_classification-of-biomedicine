Development and diversification of retinal amacrine interneurons at single cell resolution.

TJ Cherry, JM Trimarchi, MB Stadler, CL Cepko

The vertebrate retina uses diverse neuronal cell types arrayed into complex neural circuits to extract, process, and relay information from the visual scene to the higher order processing centers of the brain. Amacrine cells, a class of interneurons, are thought to mediate much of the processing of the visual signal that occurs within the retina. Although amacrine cells display extensive morphological diversity, the molecular nature of this diversity is largely unknown. Furthermore, it is not known how this diversity arises during development. Here, we have combined in vivo genetic labeling, single cell genome-wide expression profiling, and classical birthdating to (i) identify specific molecular types of amacrine cells, (ii) demonstrate the molecular diversity of the amacrine cell class, and (iii) show that amacrine cell diversity arises at least in part through temporal patterning.
