Dynasore, a small molecule inhibitor of dynamin, was used to probe the role of dynamin in the endocytosis of wild-type and mutant CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). Internalization of both wild-type and 'temperature-corrected' DeltaF508 CFTR was markedly inhibited by a short exposure to dynasore, implicating dynamin as a key element in the endocytic internalization of both wild-type and mutant CFTR. The inhibitory effect of dynasore was readily reversible upon washout of dynasore from the growth media. Corr-4 ({2-(5-chloro-2-methoxy-phenylamino)-4'-methyl-[4,5']-bithiazolyl-2'-yl}-phenyl-methanonone), a pharmacological corrector of DeltaF508 CFTR biosynthesis, caused a marked increase in the cell surface expression of mutant CFTR. Co-incubation of DeltaF508 CFTR expressing cells with Corr-4 and dynasore caused a significantly greater level of cell surface CFTR than that observed in the presence of Corr-4 alone. These results argue that inhibiting the endocytic internalization of mutant CFTR provides a novel therapeutic target for augmenting the benefits of small molecule correctors of mutant CFTR biosynthesis.
