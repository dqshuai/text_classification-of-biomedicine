Structural and functional mapping of the archaeal multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex.

CD Hausmann, M Ibba

Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus contains a multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) of LysRS, LeuRS and ProRS. Elongation factor (EF) 1A also associates to the MSC, with LeuRS possibly acting as a core protein. Analysis of the MSC revealed that LysRS and ProRS specifically interact with the idiosyncratic N- and C- termini of LeuRS, respectively. EF-1A instead interacts with the inserted CP1 proofreading domain, consistent with models for post-transfer editing by class I synthetases such as LeuRS. Together with previous genetic data, these findings show that LeuRS plays a central role in mediating interactions within the archaeal MSC by acting as a core scaffolding protein.
