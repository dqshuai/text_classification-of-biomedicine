Protective effect of selenoarginine against oxidative stress in D-galactose-induced aging mice.

A Liu, Y Ma, Z Zhu

The protective effect of selenoarginine against oxidation resistance was investigated in D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging mice. The mice were divided into four groups (n=15): a normal group, a model group, a lowdose selenoarginine group (8.35 microg of Se/kg b.w./d), and a high dose selenoarginine group (16.78 microg of Se/kg b.w./d). The aging model was induced by s.c. injection D-galactose dissolved in 0.9% normal saline of a dose of 150 mg/kg/d for 6 weeks. The mice in the normal group received s.c. injection of sterile normal saline at the same dose and frequency. The results showed that oxidative stress in the liver, kidney, and brain tissues and the serum of the mice was induced by D-galactose, but selenoarginine had an obviously protective effect against D-galactose-induced aging mice. Lowdose selenoarginine performed better than high dose selenoarginine. The protective effect of selenoarginine on D-galactose-induced aging mice can be attributed to elevation of the activity of antioxidase and enhanced antioxidant defenses.
