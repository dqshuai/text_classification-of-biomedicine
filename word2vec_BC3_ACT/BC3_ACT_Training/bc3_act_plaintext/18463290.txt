Activation of the MEK/ERK/Elk-signaling cascade is a mechanism for relaying mitogenic and stress stimuli for gene activation. MEK1 is the proximate kinase for activation of ERK1/2, and nuclear targeting of ERK1/2 is obligatory for Elk1 transcriptional activity. Human biliverdin reductase (hBVR) is a recently described Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase in the MAPK insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)-signaling cascade. Using 293A cells and in vitro experiments, we detail the formation of a ternary complex of MEK/ERK/hBVR, activation of MEK1 and ERK1/2 kinase activities by hBVR, and phosphorylation of hBVR by ERK1/2. hBVR is nearly as effective as IGF1 in activating ERK; intact hBVR ATP-binding domain is necessary for Elk1 activation, whereas protein-protein interaction is the basis for hBVR activation of MEK1 and ERK. The two MAPK docking consensus sequences present in hBVR, F(162)GFP and K(275)KRILHCLGL (C- and D-box, respectively), are ERK interactive sites; interaction at each site is critical for ERK/Elk1 activation. Transfection with mutant hBVR-P(165) or peptides corresponding to the C- or D-box blocked activation of ERK by IGF1. Transfection with D-box mutant hBVR prevented the activation of ERK by wild-type protein and dramatically decreased Elk1 transcriptional activity. hBVR is a nuclear transporter of ERK; experiments with hBVR nuclear export signal (NES) and nuclear localization signal (NLS) mutants demonstrated its critical role in the nuclear localization of IGF-stimulated ERK for Elk1 activation. These findings, together with observations that si-hBVR blocked activation of ERK and Elk1 by IGF1 and prevented formation of ternary complex between MEK/ERK/hBVR, define the critical role of hBVR in ERK signaling and nuclear functions of the kinase.
