Quantitative analysis of gene expression in a single cell by qPCR.

K Taniguchi, T Kajiyama, H Kambara

We developed a quantitative PCR method featuring a reusable single-cell cDNA library immobilized on beads for measuring the expression of multiple genes in a single cell. We used this method to analyze multiple cDNA targets (from several copies to several hundred thousand copies) with an experimental error of 15.9% or less. This method is sufficiently accurate to investigate the heterogeneity of single cells.
