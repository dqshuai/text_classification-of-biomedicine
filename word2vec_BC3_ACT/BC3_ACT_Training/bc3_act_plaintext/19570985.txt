There is increasing evidence that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) contributes to inflammation independent of its angiogenic functions. Targeting some of the components in endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) effectively inhibits VEGF-induced inflammation, but little is known about how VEGF regulates WPB exocytosis. In this study, we showed that VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2), but not VEGFR1, is responsible for VEGF-induced release of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a major marker of WPBs. This is in good contrast to VEGF-stimulated interleukin-6 release from endothelium, which is selectively mediated through VEGFR1. We further demonstrated that VEGFR2-initiated phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLCgamma1)/calcium signaling is important but insufficient for full vWF release, suggesting the possible participation of another effector pathway. We found that cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling is required for full vWF release. Importantly, a single mutation of Tyr(1175) in the C terminus of VEGFR2, a tyrosine residue crucial for embryonic vasculogenesis, abolished vWF release, concomitant with defective activations of both PLCgamma1 and PKA. These data suggest that Tyr(1175) mediates both PLCgamma1-dependent and PKA-dependent signaling pathways. Taken together, our results not only reveal a novel Tyr(1175)-mediated signaling pathway but also highlight a potentially new therapeutic target for the management of vascular inflammation.
