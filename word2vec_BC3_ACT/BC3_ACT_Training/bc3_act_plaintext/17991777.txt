Influenza viruses infect vertebrates, including mammals and birds. Influenza virus reverse-genetics systems facilitate the study of the structure and function of viral factors. In contrast, less is known about host factors involved in the replication process. Here, we developed a replication and transcription system of the negative-strand RNA genome of the influenza virus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which depends on viral RNAs, viral RNA polymerases, and nucleoprotein (NP). Disruption of SUB2 encoding an orthologue of human RAF-2p48/UAP56, a previously identified viral RNA synthesis stimulatory host factor, resulted in reduction of the viral RNA synthesis rate. Using a genome-wide set of yeast single-gene deletion strains, we found several host factor candidates affecting viral RNA synthesis. We found that among them, Tat-SF1, a mammalian homologue of yeast CUS2, was a stimulatory host factor in influenza virus RNA synthesis. Tat-SF1 interacted with free NP, but not with NP associated with RNA, and facilitated formation of RNA-NP complexes. These results suggest that Tat-SF1 may function as a molecular chaperone for NP, as does RAF-2p48/UAP56. This system has proven useful for further studies on the mechanism of influenza virus genome replication and transcription.
