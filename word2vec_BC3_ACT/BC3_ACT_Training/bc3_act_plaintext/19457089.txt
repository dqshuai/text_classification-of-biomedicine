Antipsychotics are established drugs in schizophrenia treatment which, however, are not free of side effects. Lipid rafts are critical for normal brain function. Several G protein-coupled receptors, such as somatostatin (SRIF) receptors, have been shown to localize to lipid rafts. The aim of this study was to investigate whether haloperidol treatment affects the composition and functionality of lipid rafts in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Haloperidol inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis, leading to a marked reduction in cell cholesterol content and to an accumulation of sterol intermediates, particularly cholesta-8,14-dien-3beta-ol. These changes were accompanied by a loss of flotillin-1 and Fyn from the lipid rafts. We next studied the functionality of the SRIF receptor. Treatment with haloperidol reduced the inhibitory effect of SRIF on adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity. On the other side, haloperidol decreased basal AC activity but increased forskolin-stimulated AC activity. Addition of free cholesterol to the culture medium abrogated the effects of haloperidol on lipid raft composition and SRIF signaling whereas the AC response to forskolin remained elevated. The results show that haloperidol, by affecting cholesterol homeostasis, ultimately alters SRIF signaling and AC activity, which might have physiological consequences.
