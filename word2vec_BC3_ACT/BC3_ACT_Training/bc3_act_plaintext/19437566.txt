AIM: To compare creatinine clearance (Ccr) with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in preoperative renal function tests in patients undergoing hepatectomy. METHODS: The records of 197 patients undergoing hepatectomy between August 2006 and August 2008 were studied, and preoperative Ccr, a three-variable equation for eGFR (eGFR3) and a five-variable equation for eGFR (eGFR5) were calculated. Abnormal values were defined as Ccr < 50 mL/min, eGFR3 and eGFR5 < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). The maximum increases in the postoperative serum creatinine (post Cr) level and postoperative rate of increase in the serum Cr level (post Cr rate) were compared. RESULTS: There were 37 patients (18.8%) with abnormal Ccr, 31 (15.7%) with abnormal eGFR3, and 40 (20.3%) with abnormal eGFR5. Although there were no significant differences in the post Cr rate between patients with normal and abnormal Ccr, eGFR3 and eGFR5 values, the post Cr level was significantly higher in patients with eGFR3 and eGFR5 abnormality than in normal patients (P < 0.0001). Post Cr level tended to be higher in patients with Ccr abnormality (P = 0.0936 and P = 0.0875, respectively). CONCLUSION: eGFR5 and the simpler eGFR3, rather than Ccr, are recommended as a preoperative renal function test in patients undergoing hepatectomy.
