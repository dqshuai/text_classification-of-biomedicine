Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease characterized by the influx of macrophages and T cells and IL-17 may connect innate and adaptive immune responses involved in atherogenesis. We investigated the role of IL-17 receptor signaling in atherosclerosis and transplanted LDLr deficient recipient mice with IL-17R deficient bone marrow. Induction of atherosclerosis by Western-type diet induced a 46% reduction in lesion size in the aortic root and the plaque composition revealed no significant changes in collagen content and neutrophil counts, but a reduction in mast cell number and an increase in macrophage number. In addition, we observed a decrease in anti-oxLDL antibodies of the IgG class upon IL-17R BMT, while introduction of IL-17R deficient bone marrow resulted in a reduced IL-6 production and an increased IL-10 production. In conclusion, signaling via the IL-17 receptor in bone marrow derived cells enhances the process of atherosclerosis.
