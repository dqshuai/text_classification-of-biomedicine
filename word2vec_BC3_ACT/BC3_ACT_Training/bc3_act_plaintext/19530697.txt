Discovery of 2-[5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-1-(2,4-dichloro-phenyl)-4-ethyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]-1,5,5-trimethyl-1,5-dihydro-imidazol-4-thione (BPR-890) via an active metabolite. A novel, potent and selective cannabinoid-1 receptor inverse agonist with high antiobesity efficacy in DIO mice.

By using the active metabolite 5 as an initial template, further structural modifications led to the identification of the titled compound 24 (BPR-890) as a highly potent CB1 inverse agonist possessing an excellent CB2/1 selectivity and remarkable in vivo efficacy in diet-induced obese mice with a minimum effective dose as low as 0.03 mg/kg (po qd) at the end of the 30-day chronic study. Current SAR studies along with those of many existing rimonabant-mimicking molecules imply that around the pyrazole C3-position, a rigid and deep binding pocket should exist for CB1 receptor. In addition, relative to the conventional carboxamide carbonyl, serving as a key hydrogen-bond acceptor during ligand-CB1 receptor interaction, the corresponding polarizable thione carbonyl might play a more critical role in stabilizing the Asp366-Lys192 salt bridge in the proposed CB1-receptor homology model and inducing significant selectivity for CB1R over CB2R.
