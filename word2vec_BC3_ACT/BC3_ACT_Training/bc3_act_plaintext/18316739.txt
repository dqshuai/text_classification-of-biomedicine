We have designed MI-219 as a potent, highly selective and orally active small-molecule inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 interaction. MI-219 binds to human MDM2 with a K(i) value of 5 nM and is 10,000-fold selective for MDM2 over MDMX. It disrupts the MDM2-p53 interaction and activates the p53 pathway in cells with wild-type p53, which leads to induction of cell cycle arrest in all cells and selective apoptosis in tumor cells. MI-219 stimulates rapid but transient p53 activation in established tumor xenograft tissues, resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and complete tumor growth inhibition. MI-219 activates p53 in normal tissues with minimal p53 accumulation and is not toxic to animals. MI-219 warrants clinical investigation as a new agent for cancer treatment.
