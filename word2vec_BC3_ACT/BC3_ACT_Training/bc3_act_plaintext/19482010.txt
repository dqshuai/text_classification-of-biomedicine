Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from several adult human tissues are reported to be a promising tool for regenerative medicine. In order to broaden the array of tools for therapeutic application, we isolated a new population of cells from adult human testis termed gonadal stem cells (GSCs). GSCs express CD105, CD166, CD73, CD90, STRO-1 and lack hematopoietic markers CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR which are characteristic identifiers of MSCs. In addition, GSCs express pluripotent markers Oct4, Nanog, and SSEA-4. GSCs propagated for at least 64 population doublings and exhibited clonogenic capability. GSCs have a broad plasticity and the potential to differentiate into adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic cells. These studies demonstrate that GSCs are easily obtainable stem cells, have growth kinetics and marker expression similar to MSCs, and differentiate into mesodermal lineage cells. Therefore, GSCs may be a valuable tool for therapeutic applications.
