Here, we demonstrated photoinduced NO generation from a 2,6-dimethylnitrobenzene-based compound (Flu-DNB) via a two-photon excitation (TPE) process. After pulse laser irradiation to a solution of Flu-DNB, oxidation products of NO were observed. This is the first account of a non-nitrosyl-chelated metal ion containing NO donor which can be controlled by the TPE technique.
