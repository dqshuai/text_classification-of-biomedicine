Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been extensively studied because of their functional attributes in development and diseases. However, relatively few in vivo functional studies have been reported on the roles of MMPs in postembryonic organ development. Amphibian metamorphosis is a unique model for studying MMP function during vertebrate development because of its dependence on thyroid hormone (T3) and the ability to easily manipulate this process with exogenous T3. The MMP stromelysin-3 (ST3) is induced by T3, and its expression correlates with cell death during metamorphosis. We have previously shown that ST3 is both necessary and sufficient for larval epithelial cell death in the remodeling intestine. To investigate the roles of ST3 in other organs and especially on different cell types, we have analyzed the effect of transgenic overexpression of ST3 in the tail of premetamorphic tadpoles. We report for the first time that ST3 expression, in the absence of T3, caused significant muscle cell death in the tail of premetamorphic transgenic tadpoles. On the other hand, only relatively low levels of epidermal cell death were induced by precocious ST3 expression in the tail, contrasting what takes place during natural and T3-induced metamorphosis when ST3 expression is high. This cell type-specific apoptotic response to ST3 in the tail suggests distinct mechanisms regulating cell death in different tissues. Furthermore, our analyses of laminin receptor, an in vivo substrate of ST3 in the intestine, suggest that laminin receptor cleavage may be an underlying mechanism for the cell type-specific effects of ST3.
