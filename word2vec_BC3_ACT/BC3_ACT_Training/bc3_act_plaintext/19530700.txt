In this paper, a peptide substrate (Pep8) of TSSK1 is identified. Using Pep8 as a substrate, two homogeneous and efficient assays for TSSK1 inhibitors screening have been developed, including luminescent kinase assay and LC-MS-based high-throughput assay. Two classes of compounds were identified that are able to efficiently inhibit phosphorylation catalyzed by TSSK1.
