Rab GTPases are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking. We sought to elucidate the roles of Rab GTPases in Xenopus gastrulation, and found that a Xenopus homolog of Rab40 (XRab40) is required for normal gastrulation. XRab40 is localized at the Golgi apparatus and interacts with ElonginB/C and Cullin5 to form a ubiquitin ligase. XRab40/XCullin5 functions cooperatively and regulates the ubiquitination and localization of Rap2 GTPase. Furthermore, XRab40/XCullin5 regulates the membrane localization of Dishevelled (Dsh), a key signaling molecule in the Wnt pathway, through Rap2 and its effector Misshapen/Nck-interacting kinase (XMINK). XMINK interacts with Dsh, and is translocated to the plasma membrane by Wnt activation. We propose a novel signaling cascade consisting of XRab40/XCullin5, Rap2 and XMINK, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of the noncanonical Wnt pathway.
