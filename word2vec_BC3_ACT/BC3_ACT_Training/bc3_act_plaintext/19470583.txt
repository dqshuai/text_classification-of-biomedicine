Integrin alpha9beta1 mediates enhanced cell migration through nitric oxide synthase activity regulated by Src tyrosine kinase.

SK Gupta, NE Vlahakis

Integrins are important mediators of cell adhesion and migration, which in turn are essential for diverse biological functions, including wound healing and cancer metastasis. The integrin alpha9beta1 is expressed on numerous mammalian tissues and can mediate accelerated cell migration. As the molecular signaling mechanisms that transduce this effect are poorly defined, we investigated the pathways by which activated integrin alpha9beta1 signals migration. We found for the first time that specific ligation of integrin alpha9beta1 rapidly activates Src tyrosine kinase, with concomitant tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and activation of Rac-1. Furthermore, activation of integrin alpha9beta1 also enhanced NO production through activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Inhibition of Src tyrosine kinase or NOS decreased integrin-alpha9beta1-dependent cell migration. Src appeared to function most proximal in the signaling cascade, in a FAK-independent manner to facilitate iNOS activation and NO-dependent cell migration. The cytoplasmic domain of integrin alpha9 was crucial for integrin-alpha9beta1-induced Src activation, subsequent signaling events and cell migration. When taken together, our results describe a novel and unique mechanism of coordinated interactions of the integrin alpha9 cytoplasmic domain, Src tyrosine kinase and iNOS to transduce integrin-alpha9beta1-mediated cell migration.
