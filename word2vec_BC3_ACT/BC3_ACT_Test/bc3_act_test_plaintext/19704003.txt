Mrd1p is required for release of base-paired U3 snoRNA within the preribosomal complex.

In eukaryotes, ribosomes are made from precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA) and ribosomal proteins in a maturation process that requires a large number of snoRNPs and processing factors. A fundamental problem is how the coordinated and productive folding of the pre-rRNA and assembly of successive pre-rRNA-protein complexes is achieved cotranscriptionally. The conserved protein Mrd1p, which contains five RNA binding domains (RBDs), is essential for processing events leading to small ribosomal subunit synthesis. We show that full function of Mrd1p requires all five RBDs and that the RBDs are functionally distinct and needed during different steps in processing. Mrd1p mutations trap U3 snoRNA in pre-rRNP complexes both in base-paired and non-base-paired interactions. A single essential RBD, RBD5, is involved in both types of interactions, but its conserved RNP1 motif is not needed for releasing the base-paired interactions. RBD5 is also required for the late pre-rRNP compaction preceding A(2) cleavage. Our results suggest that Mrd1p modulates successive conformational rearrangements within the pre-rRNP that influence snoRNA-pre-rRNA contacts and couple U3 snoRNA-pre-rRNA remodeling and late steps in pre-rRNP compaction that are essential for cleavage at A(0) to A(2). Mrd1p therefore coordinates key events in biosynthesis of small ribosome subunits.
