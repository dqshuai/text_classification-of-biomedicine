MicroRNAs as regulators of death receptors signaling.

M Garofalo, GL Condorelli, CM Croce, G Condorelli

Death receptors, belonging to the TNF receptor superfamily, induce apoptosis through two different pathways, one involving the effector caspases directly (type I cells or mitochondria-independent death), the other one amplifying the death signal through the mitochondrial pathway (type II cells or mitochondria-dependent death). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that regulate the stability or translational efficiency of targeted messenger RNAs. MiRNAs are involved in many cellular processes that are altered in cancer, such as differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. In this review we will discuss recent findings implicating miRNAs as regulators of death receptors and pro- and antiapoptotic genes involved in programmed cell death pathways.
