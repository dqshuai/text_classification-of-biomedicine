RATIONALE: Myocardial infiltrating macrophages play an important role in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis in male BALB/c mice following coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection. Interestingly, comparable macrophage numbers were observed in the myocardium of female mice during acute myocarditis. OBJECTIVE: Given CVB3 infection causes severe myocarditis in male but not female mice, we postulated that macrophages infiltrating the myocardium of female mice may display distinct functional properties that contribute to differential susceptibility to CVB3 myocarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we found that myocardial infiltrating macrophages from CVB3-infected male mice expressed high levels of classically activated macrophages (M1) markers, including inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and CD16/32, whereas those of females showed enhanced expression of arginase 1, interleukin-10, macrophage mannose receptor (MMR) and macrophage galactose type C-type lectin (MGL) that were associated with alternatively activated macrophage (M2) phenotype. Moreover, distinct myocardial-derived cytokines were found to play a critical role in differential macrophage polarization between sexes after CVB3 infection. Adoptive transfer of ex vivo programmed M1 macrophages, as expectedly, significantly increased myocarditis in both male and female mice. Strikingly, transfer of M2 macrophages into susceptible male mice remarkably alleviated myocardial inflammation by modulating local cytokine profile and promoting peripheral regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this study may facilitate the understanding of the mechanism underlying gender bias in susceptibility to CVB3 myocarditis and the development of therapeutic strategies based on macrophage polarization for inflammatory heart disease.
