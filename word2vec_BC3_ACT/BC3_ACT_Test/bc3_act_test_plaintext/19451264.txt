Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells constitute a distinct subset of T lymphocytes exhibiting important immune-regulatory functions. Although various steps of their differentiation have been well characterized, the factors controlling their development remain poorly documented. Here, we show that TGF-beta controls the differentiation program of iNKT cells. We demonstrate that TGF-beta signaling carefully and specifically orchestrates several steps of iNKT cell development. In vivo, this multifaceted role of TGF-beta involves the concerted action of different pathways of TGF-beta signaling. Whereas the Tif-1gamma branch controls lineage expansion, the Smad4 branch maintains the maturation stage that is initially repressed by a Tif-1gamma/Smad4-independent branch. Thus, these three different branches of TGF-beta signaling function in concert as complementary effectors, allowing TGF-beta to fine tune the iNKT cell differentiation program.
