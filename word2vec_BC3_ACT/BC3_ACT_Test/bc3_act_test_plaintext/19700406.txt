Glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit gene family.

JC Hutton, RM O'Brien

Glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose and inorganic phosphate. It is a multicomponent system located in the endoplasmic reticulum that comprises several integral membrane proteins, namely a catalytic subunit (G6PC) and transporters for G6P, inorganic phosphate, and glucose. The G6PC gene family contains three members, designated G6PC, G6PC2, and G6PC3. The tissue-specific expression patterns of these genes differ, and mutations in all three genes have been linked to distinct diseases in humans. This minireview discusses the disease association and transcriptional regulation of the G6PC genes as well as the biological functions of the encoded proteins.
