Limited role for the bilirubin-biliverdin redox amplification cycle in the cellular antioxidant protection by biliverdin reductase.

In mammalian cells, heme is degraded by heme oxygenase to biliverdin, which is then reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase (BVR). Both bile pigments have reducing properties, and bilirubin is now generally considered to be a potent antioxidant, yet it remains unclear how it protects cells against oxidative damage. A presently popular explanation for the antioxidant function of bilirubin is a redox cycle in which bilirubin is oxidized to biliverdin and then recycled by BVR. Here, we reexamined this putative BVR-mediated redox cycle. We observed that lipid peroxidation-mediated oxidation of bilirubin in chloroform, a model of cell membrane-bound bilirubin, did not yield biliverdin, a prerequisite for the putative redox cycle. Similarly, H(2)O(2) did not oxidize albumin-bound bilirubin to biliverdin, and in vitro oxidation of albumin or ligandin-bound bilirubin by peroxyl radicals gave modest yields of biliverdin. In addition, decreasing cellular BVR protein and activity in HeLa cells using RNA interference did not alter H(2)O(2)-mediated cell death, just as BVR overexpression failed to enhance protection of these cells against H(2)O(2)-mediated damage, irrespective of whether bilirubin or biliverdin were added to the cells as substrate for the putative redox cycle. Similarly, transformation of human BVR into hmx1 (heme oxygenase) mutant yeast did not provide protection against H(2)O(2) toxicity above that seen in hmx1 mutant yeast expressing human heme oxygenase-1. Together, these results argue against the BVR-mediated redox cycle playing a general or important role as cellular antioxidant defense mechanism.
