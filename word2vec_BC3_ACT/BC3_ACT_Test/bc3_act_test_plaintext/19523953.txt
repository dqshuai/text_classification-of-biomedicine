Biosensor-based label-free assays of amyloid growth.

Uncontrolled fibrous protein aggregation is implicated in a range of aberrant biological phenomena. Much effort has consequently been directed towards establishing quantitative in vitro assays of this process with the aim of probing amyloid growth in molecular detail as well as elucidating the effect of additional species on this reaction. In this paper, we discuss some recent approaches based on label-free technologies focussed on achieving these objectives. Several biosensor techniques have been developed to monitor biomolecular assembly without the requirement for fluorophore marker molecules; in particular quartz crystal microbalance and surface plasmon resonance measurements provide advantageous alternatives to traditional spectroscopic methods and are currently receiving increasing attention in the context of amyloid growth assays.
