Neuron

Baby got brain: Fgf10 sets rostral cortical size.

TN Phoenix, S Temple

Brain growth occurs throughout embryogenesis and early postnatal life, but its foundation is laid in the primitive neuroepithelium. In this issue of Neuron, Sahara and O'Leary identify Fgf10 as a key regulator of the neuroepithelial to radial glial transition and subsequently of size of the rostral forebrain.
