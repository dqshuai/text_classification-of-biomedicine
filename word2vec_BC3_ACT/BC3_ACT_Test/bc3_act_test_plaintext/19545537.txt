Solid-liquid interface method (SLIM): a new crystallization method for proteins.

E Brostromer, J Nan, LF Li, XD Su

Despite impressive advances in theories, methods and technologies, crystallization still remains a serious bottleneck in structural determination of macromolecules. Here we present a novel solid-liquid interface method (SLIM) for protein crystallization, based on the pre-adding and drying of a crystallization reagent, and thereafter the dispensing of a protein solution to the dried media to initiate crystallization from the solid-liquid interface. Not only quick and easy to perform, the method also allows for a less concentrated protein solution for setting up crystallization trials.
