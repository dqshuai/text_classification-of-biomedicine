Neuron

A nonvisual look at the functional organization of visual cortex.

MV Peelen, S Kastner

In this issue of Neuron, Mahon et al. show that the ventral visual cortex of congenitally blind individuals, who have never experienced the visual world, has an object-category organization similar to that found in sighted individuals. Here, we discuss the implications of this finding for our understanding of the "visual" cortex.
