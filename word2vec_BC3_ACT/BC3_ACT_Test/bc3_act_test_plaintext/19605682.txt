Interpreting spatial information and regulating mitosis in response to spindle orientation.

DJ Burke

The spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) is a regulatory mechanism that ensures accurate segregation of chromosomes in polarized cells during mitosis. In this issue of Genes & Development, Chan and Amon (pp. 1639-1649) identify a phosphoprotein phosphatase (Rts1-PP2A) as a new member of the checkpoint in budding yeast and define its role in interpreting spatial information during mitosis.
