Histone acetylation and deacetylation are important for gene regulation. The histone acetyltransferase, Gcn5, is an activator of transcriptional initiation that is recruited to gene promoters. Here, we map genome-wide Gcn5 occupancy and histone H3K14ac at high resolution. Gcn5 is predominantly localized to coding regions of highly transcribed genes, where it collaborates antagonistically with the class-II histone deacetylase, Clr3, to modulate H3K14ac levels and transcriptional elongation. An interplay between Gcn5 and Clr3 is crucial for the regulation of many stress-response genes. Our findings suggest a new role for Gcn5 during transcriptional elongation, in addition to its known role in transcriptional initiation.
