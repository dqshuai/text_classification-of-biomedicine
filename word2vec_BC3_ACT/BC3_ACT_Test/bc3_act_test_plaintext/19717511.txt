LPS-induced sepsis results in oxidative modification and inactivation of carboxypeptidase B1 (CPB1). In this study, immunoprecipitated CPB1 was probed for tyrosine nitration using monoclonal nitrotyrosine-specific Abs in a murine model of LPS-induced sepsis. Tyrosine nitration of CPB1 was significantly reduced in the presence of NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors and the xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor allopurinol and in NOS-3 knockout (KO) mice. CPB1 tyrosine nitration and loss of activity by the concerted action of NOS-3 and XO were also confirmed in vitro using both the NO donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine and peroxynitrite. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry data indicated five sites of tyrosine nitration in vitro including Tyr(248), the tyrosine at the catalytic site. The site- and protein-specific nitration of CPB1 and the possible high nitration yield to inactivate it were elucidated by confocal microscopy. The studies indicated that CPB1 colocalized with NOS-3 in the cytosol of sinus-lining cells in the red pulp of the spleen. Further analysis of CPB1-immunoprecipitated samples indicated immunoreactivity to a monoclonal NOS-3 Ab, suggesting protein complex formation with CPB1. XO and NOS inhibitors and NOS-3 KO mice injected with LPS had decreased levels of C5a in spleens of septic mice, indicating peroxynitrite as a possible cause for CPB1 functional alteration. Thus, CPB1 colocalization, coupling, and proximity to NOS-3 in the sinus-lining cells of spleen red pulp could explain the site-specific tyrosine nitration and inactivation of CPB1. These results open up new avenues for the investigation of several enzymes involved in inflammation and their site-specific oxidative modifications by protein-protein interactions as well as their role in sepsis.
