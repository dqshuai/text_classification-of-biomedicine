Although the pathogenic role of B cells and CD4 T cells has been studied extensively, less is known about the role of CD8 T cells in autoimmunity and self-tolerance. To evaluate the role of CD8 T cells in autoimmunity and its modulation using self-peptides, we used mice expressing soluble OVA (sOVA) under control of the keratin-14 promoter. Spontaneous autoimmunity occurred when sOVA mice were crossed with OT-I mice, whose CD8 T cells carry a Valpha2/Vbeta5-transgenic TCR with specificity for the OVA(257-264) peptide. Eighty-three percent of OVA/OT-I mice died during the first 2 wk of life due to multiple organ inflammation. In contrast, preventive or therapeutic OVA(257-264) peptide injections induced a dose-dependent increase in survival. Healthy survivors exhibited reductions in peripheral CD8 T cells, CD8 coreceptor, and Valpha2 expression. Furthermore, CD8 T cells from healthy mice were anergic and could not be activated by exogenous IL-2. A block in IL-2/IL-7 signaling via the STAT5 pathway provided the basis for low surface expression of the CD8 coreceptor and failure of IL-2 to break CD8 T cell anergy. Thus, the soluble TCR ligand triggered multiple tolerance mechanisms in these sOVA/OT-I mice, making this treatment approach a potential paradigm for modulating human autoimmune diseases.
