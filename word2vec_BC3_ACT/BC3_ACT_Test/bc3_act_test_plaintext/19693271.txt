OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the prevalence and correlates of active trachoma in Ankober, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted during July 2007. A total of 507 children (ages 1-9 years), from 232 households were included in the study. All children were examined for trachoma by ophthalmic nurses using the WHO simplified clinical grading system. Interviews and observations were used to assess risk factors. Logistic regression procedures were used to determine associations between potential risk factors and signs of active trachoma. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of active trachoma was found to be 53.9% (95%CI 49.6%-58.2%). Presence of fly-eye (fly contact with the eyelid margin during eye examination) (Odds Ratio (OR) = 4.03 95% CI 1.40-11.59), absence of facial cleanliness (OR = 7.59; 95%CI 4.60-12.52), an illiterate mother (OR = 5.88; 95%CI 2.10-15.95), lack of access to piped water (OR = 2.19; 95%CI 1.14-6.08), and lack of access to latrine facilities (OR = 4.36; 95%CI 1.49-12.74) were statistically significantly associated with increased risk of active trachoma. CONCLUSION: Active trachoma among children 1-9 years of age in Ankober is highly prevalent and significantly associated with a number of risk factors including access to water and latrine facilities. Trachoma prevention programs that include improved access to water and sanitation, active fly control, and hygiene education are recommended to lower the burden of trachoma in Ankober, Ethiopia.
