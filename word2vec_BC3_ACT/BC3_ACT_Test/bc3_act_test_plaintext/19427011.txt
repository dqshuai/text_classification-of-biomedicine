D RNA 3Yalpha (D3Yalpha), a defective (D) RNA 3 derived from the Y strain of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV-Y), was further characterized in combination with different helper viruses in the genus Cucumovirus. Interestingly, Nicotiana benthamiana plants inoculated with CMV-D8 and D3Yalpha developed systemic symptoms which were different from those induced by CMV-D8. To elucidate the potential effects of D RNA 3 on virus infection on the basis of the original combination of CMV-Y and D3Yalpha, a point mutation was made in the coat protein gene, which determined symptoms, of either CMV-Y RNA 3 (Y3) or D3Yalpha. Symptoms induced on N. benthamiana and N. tabacum plants, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the ratio of RNA 3 to D RNA 3 was associated with the differences of symptoms in the leaf tissues. Furthermore, analysis of in situ hybridization suggested that there were spatial effects between coat proteins of Y3 and D3Yalpha in the infected leaves.
