Citation analysis: Maintenance of h-index and use of e-index.

MV Dodson

Citation analysis numbers are being used as measures of faculty productivity and/or impact.

During this time of budgetary uncertainty it is more vital than ever to incorporate citation analysis into annual review packages or any departmental report that relies on such faculty data. The focus of this paper is to describe the next step in this process.
