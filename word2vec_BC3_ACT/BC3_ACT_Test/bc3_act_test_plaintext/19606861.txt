Pd(II)-catalyzed amination of C-H bonds using single-electron or two-electron oxidants.

TS Mei, X Wang, JQ Yu

Pd(II)-catalyzed intramolecular amination of arenes is developed using either a one- or two-electron oxidant. The reaction protocol tolerates a wide range of deactivating groups including acetyl, cyano, and nitro groups. This catalytic reaction allows expedient syntheses of broadly useful substituted indolines or indoles.
