Identification and characterization of Rhizot, a novel LTR retrotransposon of Rhizopus oryzae and R. delemar.

A Abe, K Asano, T Sone

A novel retrotransposon Rhizot was identified in Rhizopus oryzae and R. delemar. Rhizot has a unique structure that consists of a pol ORF similar to non-LTR (long terminal repeat) retorotransposons between two LTRs. Rhizot was distributed in all Rhizopus species tested. The Rhizot pol gene was transcribed in the liquid culture, and was induced by UV and oxidative stress.
