In the last years, proteomic investigation provided a powerful tool in molecular characterization of complex allergen sources with relevant implications in both diagnosis and immunotherapic treatment of allergies. We followed a proteomic approach to characterize ryegrass (Lolium perenne) pollen, a common cause of seasonal allergic diseases affecting an increasing part of world population. Peptide shotgun experiments performed on nanoLiquid Ultra Pressure Chromatography coupled with fast Q-TOF MS-MS/MS acquisition protocols (MS(E)) and 2-DE immunoblot combined with MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis allowed the detection of all previously identified ryegrass allergens. Comparative analysis of immunoblot highlighted a class of patients characterized by a more complex 2-DE pattern associated with increased levels of IgE antibodies and by higher susceptibility to multiple sensitization toward different allergen sources. Cluster analysis revealed that all these patients recognized profilin, considered the main cross-reactive allergen in grass pollen. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of other IgE reactive components in ryegrass pollen that might be involved in polysensitization, such as cyclophilin, fructosyltransferase and legumin-like protein.
