Lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), a member of beta2-integrin family, exerts multiple roles in host T cell immunity and has been identified as a useful drug-development target for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Applying the findings that primary resting T cells absorb nanometric membrane vesicles derived from antigen presenting cells (APC) via dual receptor/ligand interactions of T cell receptor (TCR) with cognate peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complex (pMHC) and LFA-1 with its ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and that signaling cascades triggered by TCR/pMHC interaction take a part in the vesicle-absorption, we established a cell-based high throughput assay for systematic investigation, via isolation of small molecules modulating the level of vesicle-absorption, of molecular mechanisms underlying the T cell absorption of APC-derived vesicles, i.e., structural basis of TCR/pMHC and LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions and TCR-mediated LFA-1 activation. As primary T cells along with physiological ligands expressed in biological membrane are used and also individual cells in assay samples are analyzed by flow cytometry, results obtained using the assay system hold superior physiological and therapeutic relevance as well as statistical precision.
