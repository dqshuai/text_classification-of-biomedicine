Bax activation by Bim?

PE Czabotar, PM Colman, DC Huang

The mechanism by which the cell death mediator Bax becomes activated to cause mitochondrial damage, a key step for the intrinsic pathway to apoptosis, remain highly contentious. Although some data support a role for certain BH3-only proteins, such as Bim or tBid, to directly activate Bax, others have led to the conclusion that BH3-only proteins act indirectly by antagonizing the prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, thereby allowing Bax activation to proceed. A recent paper in Nature by Gavathiotis et al. provides the first biophysical evidence for a direct interaction between a BH3 domain, that of Bim, with Bax. Here, we review these intriguing observations and discuss their implications for our understanding of how the BH3-only proteins initiate apoptosis.
