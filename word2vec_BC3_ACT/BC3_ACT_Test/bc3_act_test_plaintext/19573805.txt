Reflections on miR-ing effects in metastasis.

N Dumont, TD Tlsty

In a recent issue of Cell, Valastyan et al. demonstrate that miR-31 can regulate multiple steps in the metastatic cascade independent of confounding effects on primary tumor development. These data have potential to provide biomarkers for prognosis and novel targets for intervention in this most lethal aspect of malignancy.
