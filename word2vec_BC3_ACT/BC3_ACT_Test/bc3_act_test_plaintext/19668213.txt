Insights into anaphase promoting complex TPR subdomain assembly from a CDC26-APC6 structure.

The multisubunit anaphase promoting complex (APC) is an essential cell-cycle regulator. Although CDC26 is known to have a role in APC assembly, its molecular function has remained unclear. Biophysical, structural and genetic studies presented here reveal that CDC26 stabilizes the structure of APC6, a core TPR protein required for APC integrity. Notably, CDC26-APC6 association involves an intermolecular TPR mimic composed of one helix from each protein.
