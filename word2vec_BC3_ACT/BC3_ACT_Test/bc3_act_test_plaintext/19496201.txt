An ileal perforation resulting from a migrated biliary stent is a rare complication of endoscopic stent placement for benign or malignant biliary tract disease. We describe the case of a 59-year-old woman with a history of abdominal surgery in which a migrated biliary stent resulted in an ileal perforation. Patients with comorbid abdominal pathologies, including colonic diverticuli, parastomal hernia, or abdominal hernia, may be at increased risk of perforation from migrated stents.
