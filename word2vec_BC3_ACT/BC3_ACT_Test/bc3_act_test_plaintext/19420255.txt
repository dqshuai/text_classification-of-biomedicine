Understanding how emotion is generated, how conflicting emotions are regulated, and how emotional states relate to sophisticated behaviors is a crucial challenge in brain research. Model animals showing selective emotion-related phenotypes are highly useful for examining these issues. Here, we describe a novel mouse model that withdraws in approach-avoidance conflicts. X11-like (X11L)/Mint2 is a neuronal adapter protein with multiple protein-protein interaction domains that interacts with several proteins involved in modulating neuronal activity. X11L-knock-out (KO) mice were subordinate under competitive feeding conditions. X11L-KO mice lost significantly more weight than cohoused wild-type mice without signs of decreased motivation to eat or physical weakness. In a resident-intruder test, X11L-KO mice showed decreased intruder exploration behavior. Moreover, X11L-KO mice displayed decreased marble-burying, digging and burrowing behaviors, indicating aberrant ethological responses to attractive stimuli. In contrast, X11L-KO mice were indistinguishable from wild-type mice in the open field, elevated plus maze, and light/dark transition tests, which are often used to assess anxiety-like behavior. Neurochemical analysis revealed a monoamine imbalance in several forebrain regions. The defective ethological responses and social behaviors in X11L-KO mice were rescued by the expression of X11L under a Camk2a promoter using the Tet-OFF system during development. These findings suggest that X11L is involved in the development of neuronal circuits that contribute to conflict resolution.
