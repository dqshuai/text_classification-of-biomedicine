Expression of a CD200 transgene is necessary for induction but not maintenance of tolerance to cardiac and skin allografts.

CD200, a type 2 transmembrane molecule of the Ig supergene family, can induce immunosuppression in a number of biological systems, as well as promote increased graft acceptance, following binding to its receptors (CD200Rs). Skin and cardiac allograft acceptance are readily induced in transgenic mice overexpressing CD200 under control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter, both of which are associated with increased intragraft expression of mRNAs for a number of genes associated with altered T cell subset differentiation, including GATA-3, type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13), GITR, and Foxp3. Interestingly, some 12-15 days after grafting, induction of transgenic CD200 expression can be stopped (by doxycycline withdrawal), without obvious significant effect on graft survival. However, neutralization of all CD200 expression (including endogenous CD200 expression) by anti-CD200 mAb caused graft loss, as did introduction of an acute inflammatory stimulus (LPS, 10 microg/mouse, delivered by i.p. injection). We conclude that even with apparently stably accepted tissue allografts, disruption of the immunoregulatory balance by an intense inflammatory stimulus can cause graft loss.
