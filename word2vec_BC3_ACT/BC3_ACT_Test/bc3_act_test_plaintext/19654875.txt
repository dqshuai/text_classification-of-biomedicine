BACKGROUND: Metastasis is the most pivotal cause of mortality in cancer patients. Immune tolerance plays a crucial role in tumor progression and metastasis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, we investigated the potential roles and mechanisms of TLR2 signaling on tumor metastasis in a mouse model of intravenously injected B16 melanoma cells. Multiple subtypes of TLRs were expressed on B16 cells and several human cancer cell lines; TLR2 mediated the invasive activity of these cells. High metastatic B16 cells released more heat shock protein 60 than poor metastatic B16-F1 cells. Importantly, heat shock protein 60 released by tumor cells caused a persistent activation of TLR2 and was critical in the constitutive activation of transcription factor Stat3, leading to the release of immunosuppressive cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, targeting TLR2 markedly reduced pulmonary metastases and increased the survival of B16-bearing mice by reversing B16 cells induced immunosuppressive microenvironment and restoring tumor-killing cells such as CD8(+) T cells and M1 macrophages. Combining an anti-TLR2 antibody and a cytotoxic agent, gemcitabine, provided a further improvement in the survival of tumor-bearing mice. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that TLR2 is an attractive target against metastasis and that targeting immunosuppressive microenvironment using anti-TLR2 antibody is a novel therapeutic strategy for combating a life-threatening metastasis.
