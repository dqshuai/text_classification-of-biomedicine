Targeted mass spectrometric analysis of N-terminally truncated isoforms generated via alternative translation initiation.

Alternative translation initiation is a mechanism whereby functionally altered proteins are produced from a single mRNA. Internal initiation of translation generates N-terminally truncated protein isoforms, but such isoforms observed in immunoblot analysis are often overlooked or dismissed as degradation products. We identified an N-terminally truncated isoform of human Dok-1 with N-terminal acetylation as seen in the wild-type. This Dok-1 isoform exhibited distinct perinuclear localization whereas the wild-type protein was distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Targeted analysis of blocked N-terminal peptides provides rapid identification of protein isoforms and could be widely applied for the general evaluation of perplexing immunoblot bands.
