Cell death: a new Par-4 the TRAIL.

LS Hart, WS El-Deiry

The protein Par-4 acts in the cytoplasm to trigger cell death signaling via caspase activation and the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. Burikhanov et al. (2009) now provide surprising evidence that Par-4 can also promote apoptosis from outside the cell, after its secretion in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress.
