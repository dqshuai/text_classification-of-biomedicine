We reported previously that tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells (TcR-I) become tolerant in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. In this study, we show that CD4(+) TcR transgenic (TcR-II) T cells transferred into TRAMP mice became activated in lymph nodes, trafficked to the prostate, and initially functioned as T(H)1 cells. Although a single cotransfer of TcR-II cells delayed TcR-I cell tolerization, repeated transfer of TcR-II cells was required to prevent TcR-I cell tolerization and significantly slowed progression of TRAMP prostate tumors. After transfer of TcR-II cells, dendritic cells within the tumor expressed higher levels of costimulatory molecules and displayed an enhanced ability to stimulate proliferation of naive T cells. Blockade of CD40-CD40L interactions during TcR-II transfer resulted in a profound reduction in dendritic cell stimulatory capacity and a partial loss of TcR-I effector functions and tumor immunity. These data show that sustained provision of activated tumor-specific CD4(+) T cells alters the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, ultimately leading to the control of tumor growth. These findings will assist in the design of more effective immunotherapeutic approaches for cancer.
