Direct antigen presentation and gap junction mediated cross-presentation during apoptosis.

MHC class I molecules present peptides from endogenous proteins. Ags can also be presented when derived from extracellular sources in the form of apoptotic bodies. Cross-presentation of such Ags by dendritic cells is required for proper CTL responses. The fate of Ags in cells initiated for apoptosis is unclear as is the mechanism of apoptosis-derived Ag transfer into dendritic cells. Here we show that novel Ags can be generated by caspases and be presented by MHC class I molecules of apoptotic cells. Since gap junctions function until apoptotic cells remodel to form apoptotic bodies, transfer and cross-presentation of apoptotic peptides by neighboring and dendritic cells occurs. We thus define a novel phase in classical Ag presentation and cross-presentation by MHC class I molecules: presentation of Ags created by caspase activities in cells in apoptosis.
