Kr√ºppel-like factor 6 (Klf6) belongs to a family of zinc finger transcription factors known to play a role in development and tumor suppression. Although Klf6 is highly mutated in prostate cancer, its function in prostate development is unknown. We have generated a prostate-specific Klf6-deficient mouse model and report here a novel role for Klf6 in the regulation of prostate branching morphogenesis. Importantly, our study reveals a novel relationship between Klf6 and the Shh pathway. Klf6-deficiency leads to elevated levels of hedgehog pathway components (Shh, Ptc, and Gli) and loss of their localized expression, which in turn causes impaired lateral branching.
