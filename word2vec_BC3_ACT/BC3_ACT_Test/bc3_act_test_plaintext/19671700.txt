Protein C-mannosylation is the attachment of alpha-mannopyranose to tryptophan via a C-C linkage. This post-translational modification typically occurs within the sequence motif WXXW, which is frequently present in thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs). TSRs are especially numerous in and a defining feature of the ADAMTS superfamily. We investigated the presence and functional significance of C-mannosylation of ADAMTS-like 1/punctin-1, which contains four TSRs (two with predicted C-mannosylation sites), using mass spectrometry, metabolic labeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and expression in C-mannosylation-defective Chinese hamster ovary cell variants. Analysis of tryptic fragments of recombinant human punctin-1 by mass spectrometry identified a peptide derived from TSR1 containing the (36)WDAWGPWSECSRTC(49) sequence of interest modified with two mannose residues and a Glc-Fuc disaccharide (O-fucosylation). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and MS/MS/MS analysis demonstrated the characteristic cross-ring cleavage of C-mannose and identified the modified residues as Trp(39) and Trp(42). C-Mannosylation of TSR1 of the related protease ADAMTS5 was also identified. Metabolic labeling of CHO-K1 cells or Lec35.1 cells demonstrated incorporation of d-[2,6-(3)H]mannose in secreted punctin-1 from CHO-K1 cells but not Lec35.1 cells. Quantitation of punctin-1 secretion in Lec35.1 cells versus CHO-K1 cells suggested decreased secretion in Lec35.1 cells. Replacement of mannosylated Trp residues in TSR1 with either Ala or Phe affected punctin secretion efficiency. These data demonstrate that TSR1 from punctin-1 carries C-mannosylation in close proximity to O-linked fucose. Together, these modifications appear to provide a quality control mechanism for punctin-1 secretion.
