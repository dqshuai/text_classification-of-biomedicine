The convergent synthesis, electrochemical characterization, and photophysical studies of phthalocyanine-fullerene hybrids 3-5 bearing an orthogonal geometry (Chart ) are reported. These donor-acceptor arrays have been assembled through metal coordination of linear fullerene mono- and bispyridyl ligands to ruthenium(II) phthalocyanines. The hybrid [Ru(CO)(C(60)Py)Pc] (3) and the triad [Ru(2)(CO)(2)(C(60)Py(2))Pc(2)] (5) were prepared by treatment of the phthalocyanine 6 with the mono- and hexakis-substituted C(60)-pyridyl ligands 1 and 2, respectively. The triad [Ru(C(60)Py)(2)Pc] (4) was prepared in a similar manner from the monosubstituted C(60)-pyridyl ligand 1 and the phthalocyanine precursor 7. The simplicity of this versatile synthetic approach allows to determine the influence of the donor and acceptor ratio in the radical ion pair state lifetime. The chemical, electrochemical, and photophysical characterization of the phthalocyanine-fullerene hybrids 3-5 was conducted using (1)H and (13)C NMR, UV/vis, and IR spectroscopies, as well as mass spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry, femtosecond transient absorption studies, and nanosecond laser flash photolysis experiments. Arrays 3-5 exhibit electronic coupling between the two electroactive components in the ground state, which is modulated by the axial CO and 4-pyridylfulleropyrrolidine ligands. With respect to the excited state, we have demonstrated that RuPc/C(60) electron donor-acceptor hybrids are a versatile platform to fine-tune the outcome and dynamics of charge transfer processes. The use of ruthenium(II) phthalocyanines instead of the corresponding zinc(II) complexes allows the suppression of energy wasting and unwanted charge recombination, affording radical ion pair state lifetimes on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds for the C(60)-monoadduct-based complexes 3 and 4. For the hexakis-substituted C(60) unit 2, the reduction potential is shifted cathodically, thus raising the radical ion pair state energy. However, the location of the RuPc triplet excited state is not high enough, and still offers a rapid deactivation of the radical ion pair state.
