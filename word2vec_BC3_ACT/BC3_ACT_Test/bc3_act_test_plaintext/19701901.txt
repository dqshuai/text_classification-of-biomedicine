ZINC FINGER FUSION REVEALS SECRET UNDER MS PROBING: pp. 3979-3988Zinc fingers seem to be stuck into or onto a lot of places that turn out to be rather interesting lately. One in particular is the ZNF198-FGFR1 fusion kinase. As a fusion product, it is constitutively activated, a tyrosine kinase and linked to a particular atypical myeloproliferative disease. Phosphorylation targets include SSBP2, ABL, FLJ14235, CALM, TRIM4 and PLC-gamma. Autophosphorylation of FGFR1 at positions Y653/654, inside the kinase domain, appears to be essential for activation of the kinase. Another critical phosphorylation site is ABL at Y412, previously shown to be essential for full activation of the kinase function. Kasyapa et al. found or confirmed a number of interactions that identify the intersection of several leukemogenesis processes. NIGHT AND DAY, DAY AND NIGHT? CHANGING SHIFTS AND PROTEOMES: pp. 4017-4028Rats that must change their work shift twice a week have been observed to increase food intake and put on fat. The same phenomena are reported for human workers and their families. Mishra et al. applied proteomic tools and techniques to clarify the regulatory mechanisms of the response. 2-DE and LC-MS/MS using a linear ion trap identified >650 hypothalamic spots, 200 of which were overlapping control/experimental, and 5 showed significant volume differences. Links between light/dark cycling, diet, obesity and insulin resistance are evaluated by the authors. MAD COW DISEASE SAYS "HERE.": pp. 4029-4035Developing antibodies against your own proteins is generally not considered to be a good idea. It provokes the B lymphocytes something fierce. It's a different case if the protein is the glial fibrillary acidic protein that stirs up the system - GFAP is the prion protein, expressed in the brain, that leads to "mad cow disease" the formal name for "bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)". Since people don't care for BSE in their beefsteaks, it is beneficial to detect the presence of BSE as early as possible. What Nomura et al. observed was that measureable anti-GFAP autoantibody can be found in serum by dot blot and GFAP antigen measured by 2-DWestern blots. Forty-four percent of BSE cattle exhibited both. The test does not require the sacrifice of an animal.
