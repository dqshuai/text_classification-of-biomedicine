A bioinspired iron-based catalyst with semiconductor photocatalytic functions in combination with a high surface area holds promise for synthetic chemistry via combining photocatalysis with organosynthesis. Here exemplified for phenol synthesis, Fe-g-C(3)N(4)/SBA-15 is able to oxidize benzene to phenol with H(2)O(2) even without the aid of strong acids or alkaline promoters. By taking advantage of both catalysis and photocatalysis functions of g-C(3)N(4) nanoparticles, the yield of the phenol can be markedly promoted.
