Role of auxin-responsive genes in biotic stress responses.

C Ghanashyam, M Jain

Although the phytohormone auxin has been implicated primarily in developmental processes, some recent studies suggest its involvement in stress/defense responses as well. Recently, we identified auxin-responsive genes and reported their comprehensive transcript profiling during various stages of development and abiotic stress responses in crop plant rice. The analysis revealed tissue-specific and overlapping expression profiles of auxin-responsive genes during various stages of reproductive development. In addition, a large number of auxin-responsive genes were also found to be differentially expressed under various abiotic stress conditions. Here, we further analyze the expression profiles of auxin-responsive genes during various biotic stress conditions. Several auxin-responsive genes showed response to biotic stress as well. Our analysis provides evidence for role of auxin in plant defense responses and suggests cross-talk between auxin, abiotic stress and biotic stress signaling pathways.
