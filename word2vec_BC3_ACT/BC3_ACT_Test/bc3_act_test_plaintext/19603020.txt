KJ Johnson, JA Ross, JN Poynter, AM Linabery, LL Robison, XO Shu

METHODS: Maternally reported congenital abnormalities (CAs) were examined in a case-control study of 278 cases of paediatric germ cell tumours (GCTs) and 423 controls. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Germ cell tumours were significantly associated with cryptorchidism in males (OR=10.8, 95% CI: 2.1-55.1), but not with any other specific CA in either sex.
