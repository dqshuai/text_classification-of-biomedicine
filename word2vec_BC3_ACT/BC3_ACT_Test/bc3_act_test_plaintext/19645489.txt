Allylic C-H amination for the preparation of syn-1,3-amino alcohol motifs.

GT Rice, MC White

A highly selective and general Pd/sulfoxide-catalyzed allylic C-H amination reaction en route to syn-1,3-amino alcohol motifs is reported. Key to achieving this reactivity under mild conditions is the use of electron-deficient N-nosyl carbamate nucleophiles that are thought to promote functionalization by furnishing higher concentrations of anionic species in situ. The reaction is shown to be orthogonal to classical C-C bond-forming/-reduction sequences as well as nitrene-based C-H amination methods.
