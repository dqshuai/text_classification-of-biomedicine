Oxidation of Amplex Red by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) gives rise to an intensely colour product, resorufin. This reaction has been frequently employed for measurements based on enzyme-coupled reactions that detect hydrogen peroxide as a final reaction product. In the current study, we show that the presence of dietary antioxidants at biological concentrations in the reaction medium produced interferences in the Amplex Red/HRP catalyzed reaction that result in an over quantification of the hydrogen peroxide produced. The interference observed showed a dose-dependent manner, and a possible mechanism of interaction of dietary antioxidants with HRP in the Amplex Red-coupled-fluorescent assay is proposed.
