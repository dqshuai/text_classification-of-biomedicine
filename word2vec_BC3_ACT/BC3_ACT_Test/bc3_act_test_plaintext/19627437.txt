Tonic autoinhibition contributes to the heterogeneity of evoked dopamine release in the rat striatum.

KF Moquin, AC Michael

Electrically evoked dopamine release as measured by voltammetry in the rat striatum is heterogeneous in both amplitude and temporal profile. Previous studies have attributed this heterogeneity to variations in the density of dopamine (DA) terminals at the recording site. We reach the alternate conclusion that the heterogeneity of evoked DA release derives from variations in the extent to which DA terminals are autoinhibited. We demonstrate that low-amplitude, slow evoked DA responses occur even though recording electrodes are close to DA terminals. Moreover, the D(2) agonist and antagonist, quinpirole and raclopride, respectively, affect the slow responses in a manner consistent with the known functions of pre-synaptic D(2) autoreceptors. Recording sites that exhibit autoinhibited responses are prevalent in the dorsal striatum. Autoinhibition preceded electrical stimulation, which is consistent with our prior reports that the striatum contains a tonic pool of extracellular DA at basal concentrations that exceed the affinity of D(2) receptors. We conclude that the striatum contains DA terminals operating on multiple time courses, determined at least in part by the local variation in autoinhibition. Thus, we provide direct, real-time observations of the functional consequence of tonic and phasic DAergic signaling in vivo.
