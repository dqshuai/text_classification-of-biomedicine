Knocking in the NLRP3 inflammasome.

SE Girardin

Mutations in the human NLRP3 gene cause interleukin-1beta-related autoinflammatory syndromes. In this issue of Immunity, Brydges et al. (2009) and Meng et al. (2009) report the characterization of Nlrp3 gene-targeted mice harboring mutations mimicking those causing disease in humans.
