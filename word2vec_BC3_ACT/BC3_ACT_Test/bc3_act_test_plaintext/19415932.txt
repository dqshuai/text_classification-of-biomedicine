The photoinduced electron-transfer process in Disperse Red 1 end-capped poly[9,9-bis(4-diphenylaminophenyl)-2,7-fluorene], a promising material for electronic and optoelectronic devices, is reported here. The charge-separated configuration was found to be long-lived, with a lifetime of up to 2.2 ms in the polar benzonitrile, as inferred from time-resolved absorption measurements.
