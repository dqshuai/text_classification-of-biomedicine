Engulfment of axon debris by microglia requires p38 MAPK activity.

The clearance of debris after injuries to the nervous system is a critical step for restoration of the injured neural network. Microglia are thought to be involved in elimination of degenerating neurons and axons in the central nervous system (CNS), presumably restoring a favorable environment after CNS injuries. However, the mechanism underlying debris clearance remains elusive. Here, we establish an in vitro assay system to estimate phagocytosis of axon debris. We employed a Wallerian degeneration model by cutting axons of the cortical explants. The cortical explants were co-cultured with primary microglia or the MG5 microglial cell line. The cortical neurites were then transected. MG5 cells efficiently phagocytosed the debris, whereas primary microglia showed phagocytic activity only when they were activated by lipopolysaccharide or interferon-beta. When MG5 cells or primary microglia were co-cultured with degenerated axons, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was activated in these cells. Engulfment of axon debris was blocked by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, indicating that p38 MAPK is required for phagocytic activity. Receptors that recognize dying cells appeared not to be involved in the process of phagocytosis of the axon debris. In addition, the axons undergoing Wallerian degeneration did not release lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting that degeneration of the severed axons and apoptosis may represent two distinct self-destruction programs. We observed regrowth of the severed neurites after axon debris was removed. This finding suggests that axon debris, in addition to myelin debris, is an inhibitory factor for axon regeneration.
