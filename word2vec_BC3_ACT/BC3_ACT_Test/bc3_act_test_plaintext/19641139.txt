Lymphocytes in the development of lung inflammation: a role for regulatory CD4+ T cells in indirect pulmonary lung injury.

Although roles for myelocytes have been suggested in the pathophysiology of indirect acute lung injury (ALI not due to a direct insult to the lung), the contribution of various regulatory lymphoid subsets is unknown. We hypothesized a role for lymphocytes in this process. Using a sequential model of indirect ALI induced in mice by hemorrhagic shock followed 24 h later by polymicrobial sepsis; we observed a specific and nonredundant role for each lymphocyte subpopulation in indirect ALI pathophysiology. In particular, we showed that CD4(+) T cells are specifically recruited to the lung in a dendritic cell-independent but IL-16-dependent process and diminish neutrophil recruitment through increased IL-10 production. Most importantly, this appears to be mediated by the specific subpopulation of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. Although indirect ALI has constantly been described as a proinflammatory pathology mediated by cells of the innate immune system, we now demonstrate that cells of the adaptive immune response play a major role in its pathophysiology as well. Most importantly, we also describe for the first time the nature of the regulatory mechanisms activated in the lung during indirect ALI, with CD4(+) regulatory T cells being central to the control of neutrophil recruitment via increased IL-10 production.
