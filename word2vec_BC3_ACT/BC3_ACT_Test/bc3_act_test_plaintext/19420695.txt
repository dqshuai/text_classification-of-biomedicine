A homologous transformation system was developed using the endogenous ATP-sulfurylase gene, AasC, as a selectable marker in Aspergillus aculeatus. Spontaneous mutation was proved to be beneficial in isolating AasC-deficient mutants. Molecular analysis of sC(+) transformants revealed that the frequency of single copy integration at ATP-sulfurylase locus was more than 40%.
