Resolution/deracemization of chiral alpha-amino acids using resolving reagents with flexible stereogenic centers.

This work has demonstrated that a previously unexplored approach to separation of enantiomers via formation of diastereomeric derivatives with three stereogenic centers has obvious practical potential and deserves further systematic study. The design reported here is based on the unusual application of a configurationally unstable stereogenic nitrogen, which plays a key role in setting up the stereochemical match between the three stereogenic centers in the corresponding products.
