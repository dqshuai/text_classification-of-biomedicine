Biofuel cell logically controlled by antigen-antibody recognition: towards immune-regulated bioelectronic devices.

TK Tam, G Strack, M Pita, E Katz

A switchable biofuel cell logically controlled by immune signals was developed as a model prototype for future adaptive implantable bioelectronic devices regulated by immune reactions. The cell demonstrated NOR Boolean logic operation in situ controlled by antibody signals.
