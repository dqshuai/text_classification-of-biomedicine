ASMase: the tailor of cytotoxic T cell granule exocytosis.

C Bogdan

Deficiency in acid sphingomyelinase causes lysosomal storage of sphingomyelin, mediates resistance to stress-induced apoptosis and alters susceptibility to certain infections. New work links acid sphingomyelinase to the granule exocytosis of cytotoxic T cells.
