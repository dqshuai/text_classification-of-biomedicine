Comment on "Remeasuring the double helix".

NB Becker, R Everaers

Mathew-Fenn et al. (Reports, 17 October 2008, p. 446) reported unexpected distance fluctuations in short end-labeled DNA constructs and interpreted them as evidence for cooperative DNA stretching modes. We show that when accounting for a subtle linker leverage effect, their data can be understood within standard noncooperative DNA elasticity.
