Shape-dependent confinement in ultrasmall zero-, one-, and two-dimensional PbS nanostructures.

Spatial dimensionality affects the degree of confinement when an electron-hole pair is squeezed from one or more dimensions approaching the bulk exciton Bohr radius (a(B)) limit. The electron-hole interaction in zero-dimensional (0D) dots, one-dimensional (1D) rods/wires, and two-dimensional (2D) wells/sheets should be enhanced by the increase in confinement dimensions in the order 0D > 1D > 2D. We report the controlled synthesis of PbS nanomaterials with 0D, 1D, and 2D forms retaining at least one dimension in the strongly confined regime far below a(B) (approximately 10 nm for PbS) and provide evidence through varying the exciton-phonon coupling strength that the degree of confinement is systematically weakened by the loss of confinement dimension. Geometry variations show distinguishable far-field optical polarizations, which could find useful applications in polarization-sensitive devices.
