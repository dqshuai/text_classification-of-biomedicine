What's in a covalent bond? On the role and formation of covalently bound flavin cofactors.

DP Heuts, NS Scrutton, WS McIntire, MW Fraaije

Many enzymes use one or more cofactors, such as biotin, heme, or flavin. These cofactors may be bound to the enzyme in a noncovalent or covalent manner. Although most flavoproteins contain a noncovalently bound flavin cofactor (FMN or FAD), a large number have these cofactors covalently linked to the polypeptide chain. Most covalent flavin-protein linkages involve a single cofactor attachment via a histidyl, tyrosyl, cysteinyl or threonyl linkage. However, some flavoproteins contain a flavin that is tethered to two amino acids. In the last decade, many studies have focused on elucidating the mechanism(s) of covalent flavin incorporation (flavinylation) and the possible role(s) of covalent protein-flavin bonds. These endeavors have revealed that covalent flavinylation is a post-translational and self-catalytic process. This review presents an overview of the known types of covalent flavin bonds and the proposed mechanisms and roles of covalent flavinylation.
