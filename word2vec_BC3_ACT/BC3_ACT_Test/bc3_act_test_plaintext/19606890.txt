Double-strand break formation during nucleotide excision repair of a DNA interstrand cross-link.

JT Sczepanski, AC Jacobs, B Van Houten, MM Greenberg

The DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL) resulting from the C4'-oxidized abasic site (C4-AP) is a unique clustered lesion comprised of a cross-link adjacent to a nick. The ICL is a substrate for the UvrABC nucleotide excision repair system. The strand containing the nick is preferentially incised, but the nick influences the cleavage sites. Moreover, in approximately 15% of the molecules, the strand opposite the nick is incised, resulting in a more toxic double-strand break. This is the first example in which an interstrand cross-link is converted by nucleotide excision misrepair into a more deleterious double-strand break.
