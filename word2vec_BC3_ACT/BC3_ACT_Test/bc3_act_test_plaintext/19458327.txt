PURPOSE: The final step in the retinoid visual cycle is catalyzed by 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenases (11-cis-RDHs) that oxidize 11-cis-retinol (11cROL) to 11-cis-retinaldehyde (11cRAL). Genetic studies in mice indicate that the full repertoire of 11-cis-RDH enzymes remains to be identified. This study was conducted to characterize the 11-cis-RDH activity of RDH10 in vitro and specifically to determine whether RDH10 can functionally and physically interact with visual cycle proteins. METHODS: Human RDH10 was expressed in COS1 cells to measure its 11-cis-RDH activity in the presence or absence of purified recombinant cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP). The RPE visual cycle was reconstituted in HEK-293A cells by co-expressing RDH10, CRALBP, RPE-specific 65-kDa protein (RPE65) and lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT). The cells were subsequently treated with all-trans-retinol (atROL), and retinoid profiles were quantified by HPLC. Immunocytochemical and co-immunoprecipitation analyses were performed to determine whether RDH10 physically interacts with other visual cycle proteins. RESULTS: RDH10 oxidized 11cROL to generate 11cRAL in vitro in the presence of CRALBP. RDH10 can use both NAD(+) and NADP(+) as cofactors for 11-cis-RDH activity, although NAD(+) cofactor confers more robust activity. In a cell culture model co-expressing RDH10 with RPE65, LRAT and CRALBP, the visual chromophore 11cRAL was generated from atROL. Immunohistochemistry showed that RDH10 co-localizes with RPE65 and CRALBP in vivo in primary bovine RPE cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that RDH10 physically interacts with CRALBP and RPE65. CONCLUSIONS: RDH10 may function in the RPE retinoid visual cycle as an 11-cis-RDH, and thereby partially compensate for the loss of RDH5 function in patients with fundus albipunctatus.
