K Lindemann, LJ Vatten, M EllstrÃ¸m-Engh, A Eskild

BACKGROUND: Obesity increases the risk of uterine cancer, but results by histological type have differed. METHODS: We followed 36,755 women for 17.8 years for uterine cancers. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Body mass index (BMI) was positively associated with uterine cancers as a whole, particularly for endometrioid adenocarcinomas, for which the relative risk for very obese women (BMI: > or = 40 kg m(-2)) compared with lean (BMI: 20-24 kg m(-2)) women, was 11.1 (95% confidence interval: 5.2-23.8).
