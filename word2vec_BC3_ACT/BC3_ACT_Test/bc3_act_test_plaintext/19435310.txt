Generation and trapping of a terminal chlorophosphinidene complex.

MP Duffy, F Mathey

The system (1-chloro-3,4-dimethylphosphole)pentacarbonyltungsten + dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate generates (chlorophosphinidene)pentacarbonyltungsten at 60-70 degrees C via the 7-phosphanorbornadiene complex. This phosphinidene reacts with alkynes, alkenes, and conjugated dienes to give the corresponding chlorophosphirene, chlorophosphirane, and chlorophospholene complexes. A single isomer has been obtained in the cyclohexene case.
