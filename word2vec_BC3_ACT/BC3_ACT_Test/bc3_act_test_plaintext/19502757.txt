The full-length cDNA sequence of a new pheromone-binding protein (AscrPBP2) was determined from a geometrid moth, Ascotis selenaria cretacea, which secreted a Type II sex pheromone, and an antiserum against its recombinant protein overexpressed in Escherichia coli was prepared. In addition to this antiserum against AscrPBP2, antibodies against AscrPBP1 and general odorant-binding proteins of Bombyx mori were used in Western blotting experiments to analyze the proteins in the antennae of several lepidopteran species secreting Type II sex pheromone components.
