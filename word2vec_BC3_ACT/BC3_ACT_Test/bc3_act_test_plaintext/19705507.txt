Celiac disease can be triggered by upper abdominal surgery, such as vagotomy, oesophagectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy, and gastrojejunal anastomosis. Here we report a case of a 24 year-old woman who developed celiac disease after an ileal resection for perforated Meckel's diverticula. This is the first reported celiac case that has been triggered, not by upper abdominal surgery, but after ileal resection for Meckel's diverticula.
