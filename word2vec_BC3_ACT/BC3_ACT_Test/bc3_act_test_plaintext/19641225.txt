Syndecan-2, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, is a critical mediator in the tumorigenesis of colon carcinoma cells. We explored the function of syndecan-2 in melanoma, one of the most invasive types of cancers, and found that the expression of this protein was elevated in tissue samples from both nevus and malignant human melanomas but not in melanocytes of the normal human skin tissues. Similarly, elevated syndecan-2 expression was observed in various melanoma cell lines. Overexpression of syndecan-2 enhanced migration and invasion of melanoma cells, whereas the opposite was observed when syndecan-2 levels were knocked down using small inhibitory RNAs. Syndecan-2 expression was enhanced by fibroblast growth factor-2, which is known to stimulate melanoma cell migration; however, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone decreased syndecan-2 expression and melanoma cell migration and invasion in a melanin synthesis-independent manner. Furthermore, syndecan-2 overexpression rescued the migration defects induced by alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone treatment. Together, these data strongly suggest that syndecan-2 plays a crucial role in the migratory potential of melanoma cells.
