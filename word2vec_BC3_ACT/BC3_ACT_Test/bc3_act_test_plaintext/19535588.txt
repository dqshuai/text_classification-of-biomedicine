Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) is predominantly synthesized and secreted by astrocytes in adult brain. Our previous study showed that activation of classical dopamine receptor D(1) or D(2) elicits FGF-2 biosynthesis and secretion in astrocytes. Here, we report that astrocytic FGF-2 expression is also regulated by phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked D(1)-like receptor. SKF83959, a selective PI-linked D(1)-like receptor agonist, upregulates the levels of FGF-2 protein in striatal astrocyte cultures in classical dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptor-independent manner. The conditional medium derived from SKF83959-activated astrocytes promoted the number of TH(+) neurons in vitro. Treatment of astrocytes with SKF83959 increased intracellular calcium in two phases. Inhibition of intracellular calcium oscillation by inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) inhibitors blocked the SKF83959-induced increase in FGF-2 expression. Moreover, intraperitoneal administration of SKF83959 reversed l-methyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropypridine (MPTP)-induced reduction in FGF-2 expression in both the striatum and ventral midbrain and resulted in marked protection of dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. These results indicate that IP3/Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase is an uncharted intracellular signaling pathway that is crucial for the regulation of FGF-2 synthesis in astrocytes. PI-linked D(1)-like receptor plays an important role in the regulation of astrocytic FGF-2 expression and neuroprotection which may provide a potential target for the drug discovery in Parkinson's disease.
