Metastasis-promoting immunity: when T cells turn to the dark side.

D Pardoll

While the role of endogenous T cells in antitumor immunity is being debated, little is known about whether and how T cells promote tumorigenesis. In this issue of Cancer Cell, DeNardo and colleagues demonstrate that IL-4-producing T cells enhance metastasis by programming macrophages to produce factors that enhance tumor invasion.
