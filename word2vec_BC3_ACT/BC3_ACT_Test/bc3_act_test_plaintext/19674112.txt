Structure and potential function of gamma-aminobutyrate type A receptor-associated protein.

J Mohrl√ºder, M Schwarten, D Willbold

The gamma-aminobutyrate type A receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) is a ubiquitin-like modifier, and is implicated in a variety of membrane trafficking and fusion events that are crucial to synaptic plasticity, autophagy and apoptosis. However, important aspects of GABARAP function and regulation remain poorly understood. We review the current state of knowledge about GABARAP, highlighting newly-identified GABARAP ligands, and discuss the possible physiological relevance of each ligand interaction.
