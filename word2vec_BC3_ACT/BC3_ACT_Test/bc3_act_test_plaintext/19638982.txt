Role of miRNAs in the progression of malignant melanoma.

DW Mueller, AK Bosserhoff

Analysis of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and function is an area of research that started only recently but has subsequently accelerated tremendously. This is because of the impressive impact of miRNA-mediated gene regulation and the obvious potential of those tiny RNA molecules in future diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In this review, recent progress to reveal the role of miRNAs in the tumourigenesis of malignant melanoma, as well as future prospects of melanoma-related miRNA research, will be addressed.
