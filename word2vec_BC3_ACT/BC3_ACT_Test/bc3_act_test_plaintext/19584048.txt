Hypochlorous acid converts the gamma-glutamyl group of glutathione disulfide to 5-hydroxybutyrolactam, a potential marker for neutrophil activation.

In healthy cells, glutathione disulfide (GSSG) is rapidly reduced back to glutathione (GSH) by glutathione reductase to maintain redox status. The ratio of GSH/GSSG has been used as an indicator of oxidative stress. However, hypochlorous acid (HOCl) generated by the myeloperoxidase-H(2)O(2)-Cl(-) system of neutrophils converts GSH to irreversible oxidation products. Although several such products have been identified, yields of these compounds are very low in biological systems, and they cannot account quantitatively for thiol loss. In the current studies, we use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to demonstrate that HOCl and chloramines oxidize GSSG to two irreversible products in high yield. The products, termed M-45 and M-90, are, respectively, 45 or 90 atomic mass units lighter than GSSG. The reaction pathway involves chloramine and aldehyde intermediates, and converts the gamma-glutamyl residues of GSSG to 5-hydroxybutyrolactam. Importantly, M-45 and M-90 were resistant to reduction by glutathione reductase. Moreover, the monohydroxylbutyrolactam M-45 accounted for >90% of the endogenous GSH oxidation products generated by activated neutrophils. Because the reaction pathway involves chlorinating intermediates, hydroxylbutyrolactams are likely to be specific products of HOCl, which is generated only by myeloperoxidase. Therefore, our observations implicate M-45 as a potential biomarker for myeloperoxidase activity in vivo.
