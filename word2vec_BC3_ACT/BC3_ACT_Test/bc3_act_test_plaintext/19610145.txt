AIM: To compare the outcomes of laparoscopic and open splenectomy and azygoportal devascularization for portal hypertension. METHODS: From June 2006 to March 2009, laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (LSD) were performed on 28 patients with cirrhosis, bleeding due to portal hypertension, and secondary hypersplenism. Success was achieved in 26 patients. Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative variables of the patients were compared. RESULTS: Success of laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection was achieved in all but two patients (7.14%) who required open splenectomy and azygoportal devascularization (OSD). The operation time was significantly longer in patients undergoing LSD than in those undergoing OSD (235 +/- 36 min vs 178 +/- 47 min, P < 0.05). The estimated intraoperative blood loss was much more in patients receiving OSD than in those receiving LSD (420 +/- 50 mL vs 200 +/- 30 mL, P < 0.01). The proportion of patients undergoing laparoscopic and open splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection who received transfusion of packed red blood cells during or after the operation was 23.08% and 38.46%, respectively (P < 0.05). The time of first oral intake was faster in patients after LSD than in those after OSD (1.5 +/- 0.7 d vs 3.5 +/- 1.6 d, P < 0.05). The hospital stay of patients after LSD was shorter than that of patients after OSD (6.5 +/- 2.3 d vs 11.7 +/- 4.5 d, P < 0.05). The pain requiring medication was less severe in patients after LSD than in those after OSD (7.69% vs 73.08%, P < 0.001). The overall complication rate was lower in patients after LSD than in those after OSD (19.23% vs 42.31%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection are the feasible, effective, and safe surgical procedure, and are advantageous over minimally invasive surgery for bleeding portal hypertension and hypersplenism.
