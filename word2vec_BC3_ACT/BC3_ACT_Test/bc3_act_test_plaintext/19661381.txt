Low-temperature phase transitions and the associated quantum critical points are a major field of research, but one in which experimental information about thermodynamics is sparse. Thermodynamic information is vital for the understanding of quantum many-body problems. We show that combining measurements of the magnetocaloric effect and specific heat allows a comprehensive study of the entropy of a system. We present a quantitative measurement of the entropic landscape of Sr3Ru2O7, a quantum critical system in which magnetic field is used as a tuning parameter. This allows us to track the development of the entropy as the quantum critical point is approached and to study the thermodynamic consequences of the formation of a novel electronic liquid crystalline phase in its vicinity.
