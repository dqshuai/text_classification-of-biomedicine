Eicosanoids are essential mediators of the inflammatory response and contribute both to the initiation and the resolution of inflammation. Leukocyte-type 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO) represents a major enzyme involved in the generation of a subclass of eicosanoids, including the anti-inflammatory lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)). Nevertheless, the impact of 12/15-LO on chronic inflammatory diseases such as arthritis has remained elusive. By using two experimental models of arthritis, the K/BxN serum-transfer and a TNF transgenic mouse model, we show that deletion of 12/15-LO leads to uncontrolled inflammation and tissue damage. Consistent with these findings, 12/15-LO-deficient mice showed enhanced inflammatory gene expression and decreased levels of LXA(4) within their inflamed synovia. In isolated macrophages, the addition of 12/15-LO-derived eicosanoids blocked both phosphorylation of p38MAPK and expression of a subset of proinflammatory genes. Conversely, 12/15-LO-deficient macrophages displayed significantly reduced levels of LXA(4), which correlated with increased activation of p38MAPK and an enhanced inflammatory gene expression after stimulation with TNF-alpha. Taken together, these results support an anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective role of 12/15-LO and its products during chronic inflammatory disorders such as arthritis.
