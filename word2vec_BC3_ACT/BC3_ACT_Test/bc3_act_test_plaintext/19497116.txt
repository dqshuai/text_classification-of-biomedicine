BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality of hemodialysis (HD) patients. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological and clinical features of HCV and HBV infections in six different HD units in Kosova.Five hundred and eighty-three end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients on maintenance HD from six HD centers in Kosova (358 female, 225 male, mean age 54,8 years (16-66) were included in this study. Data from databank of the National Blood Bank in Prishtina, as well as the data from the databank of the Transfusion Centers in Regional hospitals in Prizren, Peja, Gjilan, Mitrovica and Gjakova were taken in this study. Clinical data such as age, sex, HBsAg and anti-HCV antibody and primary causes of ESKD were examined.Serological markers for HBV and HCV were determined with immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The T-test and x2 test were used to analyze the significance of the results. Among our HD patients HBsAg and anti-HCV antibody prevalence rate was 12%, respectively 43%. Chronic nephritis was a more frequent cause of ESKD among our HD patients. With unknown etiology were 23, 5% from them. CONCLUSION: HBV and HCV prevalence in our HD patients is still high. These data emphasize the need for stricter adherence to infection control, barrier precaution and preventive behaviors with all patients.
