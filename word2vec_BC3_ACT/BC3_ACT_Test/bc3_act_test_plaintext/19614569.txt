Membrane proteins in nanotechnology.

P Curnow

Integral membrane proteins are important biological macromolecules with structural features and functionalities that make them attractive targets for nanotechnology. I provide here a broad review of current activity in nanotechnology related to membrane proteins, including their application as nanoscale sensors, switches, components of optical devices and as templates for self-assembled arrays.
