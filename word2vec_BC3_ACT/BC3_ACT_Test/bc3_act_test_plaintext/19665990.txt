TRIM31 interacts with p52(Shc) and inhibits Src-induced anchorage-independent growth.

Tripartite motif-containing protein (TRIM) family proteins are involved in a broad range of biological processes and, consistently, their alterations result in diverse pathological conditions such as genetic diseases, viral infection and cancer development. In this study, we found that one of the TRIM family proteins, TRIM31, is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and interacts with p52(Shc), one of the signal transducers. We also found by a binding assay that almost the whole region other than the RING domain is required for the binding to p52(Shc) but found by pulse-chase analysis that overexpression of TRIM31 does not affect the stability of p52(Shc). Moreover, we found that overexpression of TRIM31 suppresses anchorage-independent cell growth induced by the active form of c-Src. These results suggest that TRIM31 attenuates c-Src signaling via p52(Shc) under anchorage-independent growth conditions and is potentially associated with growth activity of cells in the gastrointestinal tract.
