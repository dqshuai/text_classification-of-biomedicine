A strong correlation between fusogenicity and membrane insertion depth of the HIV fusion peptide.

W Qiang, Y Sun, DP Weliky

Fusion between the membrane of HIV and the membrane of a host cell is a crucial step in HIV infection and is catalyzed by the binding of the fusion peptide domain (HFP) of the HIV gp41 protein to the host cell membrane. The HFP by itself induces vesicle fusion and is a useful model system to understand the fusion peptide/host cell membrane interaction. This article reports an experimental correlation between the membrane locations of different HFP constructs and their fusogenicities. The constructs were the HFP monomer with Val-2 to Glu-2 mutation (HFPmn_mut), wild type HFP monomer (HFPmn), and wild type HFP trimer (HFPtr). All constructs have predominant beta sheet structure in membranes with physiologically relevant cholesterol content. HFPmn_mut does not fuse vesicles, HFPmn has moderate fusion rate, and HFPtr has the putative oligomerization state of HIV gp41 and a very rapid fusion rate. The HFP membrane locations were probed with solid-state NMR measurements of distances between labeled carbonyl ((13)CO) nuclei in the HFP backbone and lipid nuclei in the surface or interior regions of the membrane bilayer. HFPmn_mut is located at the membrane surface, HFPmn is inserted into a single membrane leaflet, and HFPtr is the most deeply inserted construct with contact with the center of the membrane. These results show a clear positive correlation between the insertion depths and the fusion activities of the HFP constructs. Other disease-causing enveloped viruses contain fusion peptides and this correlation may be a general structure-function model for these peptides.
