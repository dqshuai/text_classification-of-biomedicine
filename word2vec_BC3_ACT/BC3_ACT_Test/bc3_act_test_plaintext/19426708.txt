Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) hold great promise for regenerative medicine and transplantation therapy due to their self-renewal and pluripotent properties. We report that 2D thin film scaffolds composed of biocompatible polymer grafted carbon nanotubes (CNTs), can selectively differentiate human embryonic stem cells into neuron cells while maintaining excellent cell viability. According to fluorescence image analysis, neuron differentiation efficiency of poly(acrylic acid) grafted CNT thin films is significant greater than that on poly(acrylic acid) thin films. When compared with the conventional poly-L-ornithine surfaces, a standard substratum commonly used for neuron culture, this new type thin film scaffold shows enhanced neuron differentiation. No noticeable cytotoxic effect difference has been detected between these two surfaces. The surface analysis and cell adhesion study have suggested that CNT-based surfaces can enhance protein adsorption and cell attachment. This finding indicates that CNT-based materials are excellent candidates for hESCs' neuron differentiation.
