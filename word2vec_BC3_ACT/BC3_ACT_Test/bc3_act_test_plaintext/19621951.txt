Thermal effects of water intrusion in hydrophobic nanoporous materials.

T Karbowiak, C Paulin, A Ballandras, G Weber, JP Bellat

Liquid water intrusion in hydrophobic nanoporous silicalite-1, a pure siliceous zeolite, in isothermal conditions under high pressure produces an endothermic effect. After intrusion, confined water in zeolite pores is in a different state from that of the liquid bulk water. Such forced intrusion also chemically modifies the material and tends to render it slightly more hydrophilic.
