Full-term cord blood (TCB) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC/HPCs) are used for stem cell transplantation and are well characterized. However, the properties of preterm cord blood (PCB) HSC/HPCs remain unclear. In the present study, we compared HSC/HPCs from TCB and PCB with respect to their expression of surface markers, homing capacity and ability to repopulate HSCs in the NOD/Shi-scid mice bone marrow. The proportion of CD34+CD38- cells was significantly higher in PCB. On the other hand, the engraftment rate of TCB CD34+ cells into NOD/Shi-scid mice was significantly higher than PCB CD34+ cells. The expression of VLA4 was stronger among TCB CD34+ cells than PCB CD34+ cells. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the proportion of CD34+CXCR4+ cells and gestational age. These data suggest that the homing ability of HSCs increases during gestation, so that TCB may be a better source of HSCs for transplantation than PCB.
