Blood as a reactive species generator and redox status regulator during exercise.

MG Nikolaidis, AZ Jamurtas

The exact origin of reactive species and oxidative damage detected in blood is largely unknown. Blood interacts with all organs and tissues and, consequently, with many possible sources of reactive species. In addition, a multitude of oxidizable substrates are already in blood. A muscle-centric approach is frequently adopted to explain reactive species generation, which obscures the possibility that sources of reactive species and oxidative damage other than skeletal muscle may be also at work during exercise. Plasma and blood cells can autonomously produce significant amounts of reactive species at rest and during exercise. The major reactive species generators located in blood during exercise may be erythrocytes (mainly due to their quantity) and leukocytes (mainly due to their drastic activation during exercise). Therefore, it is plausible to assume that oxidative stress/damage measured frequently in blood after exercise or any other experimental intervention derives, at least in part, from the blood.
