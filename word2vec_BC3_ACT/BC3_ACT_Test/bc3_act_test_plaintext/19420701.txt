Synthetic studies of natural 10-membered lactones, mueggelone, microcarpalide, and sch 642305, which have interesting bioactivities.

A number of 10-membered lactones have been isolated as secondary metabolites, and many of them have interesting and potent activities. Because of synthetic and biological interests, many synthetic studies of these compounds have been made. This review summarizes synthetic approaches to three natural 10-membered lactones, mueggelone, microcarpalide, and Sch 642305. Mueggelone is an inhibitor of fish development, microcarpalide is a microfilament disrupting agent, and Sch 642305 is an inhibitor of bacterial DNA primase.
