The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is widely used for the production of proteins and as a model organism for studying peroxisomal biogenesis and methanol assimilation. P. pastoris strains capable of human-type N-glycosylation are now available, which increases the utility of this organism for biopharmaceutical production. Despite its biotechnological importance, relatively few genetic tools or engineered strains have been generated for P. pastoris. To facilitate progress in these areas, we present the 9.43 Mbp genomic sequence of the GS115 strain of P. pastoris. We also provide manually curated annotation for its 5,313 protein-coding genes.
