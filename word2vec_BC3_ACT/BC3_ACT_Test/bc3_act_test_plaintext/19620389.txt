Analysis of synthetic lethality reveals genetic interactions between the GTPase Snu114p and snRNAs in the catalytic core of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae spliceosome.

Conformational changes of snRNAs in the spliceosome required for pre-mRNA splicing are regulated by eight ATPases and one GTPase Snu114p. The Snu114p guanine state regulates U4/U6 unwinding during spliceosome activation and U2/U6 unwinding during spliceosome disassembly through the ATPase Brr2p. We investigated 618 genetic interactions to identify an extensive genetic interaction network between SNU114 and snRNAs. Snu114p G domain alleles were exacerbated by mutations that stabilize U4/U6 base pairing. G domain alleles were made worse by U2 and U6 mutations that stabilize or destabilize U2/U6 base pairing in helix I. Compensatory mutations that restored U2/U6 base pairing in helix I relieved synthetic lethality. Snu114p G domain alleles were also worsened by mutations in U6 predicted to increase 5' splice site base pairing. Both N-terminal and G domain alleles were exacerbated by U5 loop 1 mutations at positions involved in aligning exons while C-terminus alleles were synthetically lethal with U5 internal loop 1 mutations. This suggests a spatial orientation for Snu114p with U5. We propose that the RNA base pairing state is directly or indirectly sensed by the Snu114p G domain allowing the Snu114p C-terminal domain to regulate Brr2p or other proteins to bring about RNA/RNA rearrangements required for splicing.
