Looking forward in pharmaceutical process chemistry.

IW Davies, CJ Welch

Core activities of process chemistry involve the synthesis of drug candidates at a scale that supports clinical evaluations and the creation of a manufacturing process that is safe, robust, and cost effective. Innovative problem solving has always been a key element in process chemistry and will be increasingly important for addressing emerging challenges in science, globalization, and commoditization. The acquisition and creation of platform chemical technologies that enable rapid problem solving through the use of high-throughput experimentation will continue to be an important focus going forward. Linking and deploying platforms throughout the discovery-development continuum is expected to enable drug discovery. Increasing collaboration with academia will also become more important for accessing technical solutions and providing the next generation of innovative problem solvers.
