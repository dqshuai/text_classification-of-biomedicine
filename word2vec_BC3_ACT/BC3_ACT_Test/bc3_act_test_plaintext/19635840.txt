Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase 3 regulates Golgi complex structure and function.

JA Schmidt, WJ Brown

Recent studies have suggested that the functional organization of the Golgi complex is dependent on phospholipid remodeling enzymes. Here, we report the identification of an integral membrane lysophosphatidic acid-specific acyltransferase, LPAAT3, which regulates Golgi membrane tubule formation, trafficking, and structure by altering phospholipids and lysophospholipids. Overexpression of LPAAT3 significantly inhibited the formation of Golgi membrane tubules in vivo and in vitro. Anterograde and retrograde protein trafficking was slower in cells overexpressing LPAAT3 and accelerated in cells with reduced expression (by siRNA). Golgi morphology was also dependent on LPAAT3 because its knockdown caused the Golgi to become fragmented. These data are the first to show a direct role for a specific phospholipid acyltransferase in regulating membrane trafficking and organelle structure.
