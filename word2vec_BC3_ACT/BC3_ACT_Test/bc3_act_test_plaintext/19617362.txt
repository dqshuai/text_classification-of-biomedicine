Isoprenoids are essential for fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus.

W Lorenzen, MW Ring, G Schw√§r, HB Bode

It was recently shown that Myxococcus xanthus harbors an alternative and reversible biosynthetic pathway to isovaleryl coenzyme A (CoA) branching from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA. Analyses of various mutants in these pathways for fatty acid profiles and fruiting body formation revealed for the first time the importance of isoprenoids for myxobacterial development.
