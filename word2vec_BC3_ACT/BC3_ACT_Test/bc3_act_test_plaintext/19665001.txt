The microtubule-targeting agent T0070907 induces proteasomal degradation of tubulin.

G Harris, KL Schaefer

Current microtubule-targeting agents interfere with the regulated assembly of microtubules from alpha/beta tubulin heterodimers but do not markedly alter tubulin levels. Previously, we showed that the compound T0070907 interferes with microtubule function by reversibly decreasing alpha and beta tubulin protein levels by more than 50% in multiple CRC cell lines. Since tubulin levels are generally relatively stable, and cells lack regulatory networks to respond to decreased tubulin levels by increasing synthesis, our result suggested the possibility of cancer therapies that act directly on tubulin homeostasis. The aim of this study was to determine whether T0070907 caused tubulin loss by increasing the degradation rate, and determine the proteases responsible for any increased degradation. T0070907 increased tubulin degradation rates in HT-29 cells. The proteasomal inhibitors MG132, epoxomicin, lactacystin, and ALLN suppressed T0070907-mediated tubulin loss, although epoxomicin and lactacystin were less effective than MG132, even at concentrations that completely inhibited TNFalpha-induced IkappaBalpha degradation. Inhibitors of lysosomal, aggresomal, and calpain-mediated degradation, as well as the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk had no effect on tubulin loss, and the cathepsin and calpain inhibitor E64d was unable to increase epoxomicin's ability to suppress tubulin loss. We conclude that T0070907-induced tubulin degradation proceeds through a proteasome-dependent pathway.
