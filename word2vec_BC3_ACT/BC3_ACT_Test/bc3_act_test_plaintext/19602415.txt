Genital evolution: the traumas of sex.

DJ Hosken, TA Price

Copulating males usually insert their penis into the female and ejaculate in her reproductive tract; but in some species, males are more invasive, puncturing the female body-wall and inseminating directly into her body-cavity. A spider has just been added to this list and new perspectives provided on why males harm females during copulation in the first place.
