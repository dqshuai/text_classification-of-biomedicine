Memory loss, synaptic dysfunction, and accumulation of amyloid beta-peptides (A beta) are major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Downregulation of the nitric oxide/cGMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinase/c-AMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) cascade has been linked to the synaptic deficits after A beta elevation. Here, we report that the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5) sildenafil (Viagra), a molecule that enhances phosphorylation of CREB, a molecule involved in memory, through elevation of cGMP levels, is beneficial against the AD phenotype in a mouse model of amyloid deposition. We demonstrate that the inhibitor produces an immediate and long-lasting amelioration of synaptic function, CREB phosphorylation, and memory. This effect is also associated with a long-lasting reduction of A beta levels. Given that side effects of PDE5 inhibitors are widely known and do not preclude their administration to a senile population, these drugs have potential for the treatment of AD and other diseases associated with elevated A beta levels.
