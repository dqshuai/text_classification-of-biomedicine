Proton-catalyzed oxo-alkene coupling: 2-platinaoxetane formation.

NM Weliange, E Szuromi, PR Sharp

Formation of 2-platinaoxetane 2 from oxo complex 1 and norbornene (NB) is mediated by hydroxo complex 5. The facile reaction of 5 with NB to give protonated 2-platinaoxetane 7 supports the involvement of such reactions in Wacker alkene oxidation.
