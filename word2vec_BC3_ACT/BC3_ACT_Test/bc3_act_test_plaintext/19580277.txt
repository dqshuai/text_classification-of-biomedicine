Pd(0)/PR3-catalyzed intermolecular arylation of sp3 C-H bonds.

M Wasa, KM Engle, JQ Yu

Pd(0)-catalyzed intermolecular arylation of sp(3) C-H bonds has been achieved using PR(3)/ArI. This protocol can be used to arylate a variety of aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives, including a number of bioactive drug molecules. The use of fluorinated aryl iodides also allows for the introduction of fluorine into a molecule of interest.
