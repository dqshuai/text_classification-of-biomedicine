AIM: To compare postoperative quality of life (QOL) in patients with gastric cancer treated by esophagogastrostomy reconstruction after proximal gastrectomy. METHODS: QOL assessments that included functional outcomes (a 24-item survey about treatment-specific symptoms) and health perception (Spitzer QOL Index) were performed in 149 patients with gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach, who had received proximal gastrectomy with additional esophagogastrostomy. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients underwent reconstruction by esophagogastric anterior wall end-to-side anastomosis combined with pyloroplasty (EA group); 45 patients had reconstruction by esophagogastric posterior wall end-to-side anastomosis (EP group); and 50 patients had reconstruction by esophagogastric end-to-end anastomosis (EE group). The EA group showed the best postoperative QOL, such as recovery of body weight, less discomfort after meals, and less heart burn or belching at 6 and 24 mo postoperatively. However, the survival rates, surgical results and Spitzer QOL index were similar among the three groups. CONCLUSION: Postoperative QOL was better in the EA than EP or EE group. To improve QOL after proximal gastrectomy for upper third gastric cancer, the EA procedure using a stapler is safe and feasible for esophagogastrostomy.
