Compartmentalization of the outer hair cell demonstrated by slow diffusion in the extracisternal space.

O Gliko, P Saggau, WE Brownell

In the outer hair cell (OHC), the extracisternal space (ECiS) is a conduit and reservoir of the molecular and ionic substrates of the lateral wall, including those necessary for electromotility. To determine the mechanisms through which molecules are transported in the ECiS of the OHC, we selectively imaged the time-dependent spatial distribution of fluorescent molecules in a <100 nm layer near the cell/glass interface of the recording chamber after their photolytic activation in a diffraction-limited volume. The effective diffusion coefficient was calculated using the analytical solution of the diffusion equation. It was found that diffusion in the ECiS is isotropic and not affected by depolarizing the OHC. Compared with free solution, the diffusion of 10 kDa dextran was slowed down in both the ECiS and the axial core by a factor of 4.6 and 1.6, respectively.
