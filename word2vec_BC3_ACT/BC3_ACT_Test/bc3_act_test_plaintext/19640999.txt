Regulation of gene expression in primate polyomaviruses.

MK White, M Safak, K Khalili

Polyomaviruses are a growing family of small DNA viruses with a narrow tropism for both the host species and the cell type in which they productively replicate. Species host range may be constrained by requirements for precise molecular interactions between the viral T antigen, host replication proteins, including DNA polymerase, and the viral origin of replication, which are required for viral DNA replication. Cell type specificity involves, at least in part, transcription factors that are necessary for viral gene expression and restricted in their tissue distribution. In the case of the human polyomaviruses, BK virus (BKV) replication occurs in the tubular epithelial cells of the kidney, causing nephropathy in kidney allograft recipients, while JC virus (JCV) replication occurs in the glial cells of the central nervous system, where it causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Three new human polyomaviruses have recently been discovered: MCV was found in Merkel cell carcinoma samples, while Karolinska Institute Virus and Washington University Virus were isolated from the respiratory tract. We discuss control mechanisms for gene expression in primate polyomaviruses, including simian vacuolating virus 40, BKV, and JCV. These mechanisms include not only modulation of promoter activities by transcription factor binding but also enhancer rearrangements, restriction of DNA methylation, alternate early mRNA splicing, cis-acting elements in the late mRNA leader sequence, and the production of viral microRNA.
