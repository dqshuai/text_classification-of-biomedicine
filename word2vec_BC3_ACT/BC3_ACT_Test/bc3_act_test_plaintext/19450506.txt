Closing the ring: a new twist to bacterial chromosome condensation.

M Thanbichler

The mechanisms underlying chromosome organization in bacteria are still shrouded in mystery. Sullivan et al. (2009) and Gruber and Errington (2009) now report that the DNA-binding protein ParB ensures proper arrangement and partitioning of chromosomal DNA in Bacillus subtilis by recruiting the condensin SMC to the replication origin region.
