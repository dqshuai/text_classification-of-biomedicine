Heat shock proteins act as molecular chaperones, assist in peptide maturation, and transport nascent peptides across membranes. One commonly studied single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for one of the proteins is HSPA1B (+A1538G). However, several studies of this polymorphism have failed to achieve Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for their sample. We compared various published procedures for analyzing the HSPA1B +A1538G SNP and report reasons for HWE discrepancies. Samples from 141 apparently healthy, physically active, volunteers (99 men and 42 women) were analyzed. The first protocol, initially described by Schröder et al., resulted in a genotypic distribution of 22 GG (15.6%), 119 AG (84.4%), and 0 AA; results were confirmed by reanalysis and sequencing. Two other published protocols, one described by Klausz et al. and another by Fekete et al., were used to confirm these results: both resulted in 22 GG (15.6%), 46 AA (32.6%), and 73 AG (51.7%). Additionally, the results were within HWE and confirmed by sequence analysis. Of the original 119 subjects genotyped as AG by the Schröder protocol, 46 of those were confirmed as AA with the Klausz and Fekete methods. Mixing primers from the Schröder and Klausz protocol resulted in 100% concordance with the data generated by the Klausz and Fekete protocols. Some published data on HSP genotyping deviate from HWE; thus, primers used for analyzing these highly homologous genes must be carefully considered. Our results highlight the importance of reinvestigating data when HWE is not achieved for the HSPA1B, or another, polymorphism.
