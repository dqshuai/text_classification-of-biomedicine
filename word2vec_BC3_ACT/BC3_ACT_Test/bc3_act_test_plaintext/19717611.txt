Investigation of the three-dimensional architecture of the collagen adhesin EmaA of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans by electron tomography.

The periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans displays on the bacterial surface a nonfimbrial adhesin, EmaA, which is required for collagen binding. In this study, electron tomography was used to characterize the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of this adhesin. The antenna-like surface appendages, corresponding to EmaA, were found to be composed of an ellipsoidal domain capping a rod-like domain that adopts either a straight or a bent conformation at various positions along the length. The most common flexible point along the length of the EmaA appendage was localized 29.4 nm away from the distal end. One-fifth of the appendages were straight and the remaining showed angles distributed between 140 degrees and 170 degrees at this location. Deletion analysis mapped this bend to amino acids 611 to 640 of the protein sequence. The 3D structure of the collagen binding domain of EmaA was generated by alignment and averaging of 9 subvolumes of the adhesin extracted from tomograms. The structure contains three subdomains: a globular structure with a diameter of approximately 5 nm and a cylindrical domain ( approximately 4.4 nm by 5.8 nm) separated by a linker region with a diameter of approximately 3 nm, followed by a cylindrical domain ( approximately 4.6 nm by 6.6 nm). This is the first 3D structure of a trimeric autotransporter protein of A. actinomycetemcomitans.
