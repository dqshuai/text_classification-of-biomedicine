Regulatory mechanism of matrix metalloprotease-2 enzymatic activity by factor Xa and thrombin.

Matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 plays a key role in many biological and pathological processes related to cell migration, invasion, and mitogenesis. MMP-2 is synthesized as a zymogen that is activated through either a conformational change or proteolysis of the propeptide. Several activating enzymes for pro-MMP-2 have been proposed, including metalloproteases and serine proteases. The mechanism of pro-MMP-2 activation by metalloproteases is well established, and the most studied activation mechanism involves cleavage of the propeptide by membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP). In contrast, serine protease activation has not been thoroughly studied, although studies suggest that MT1-MMP may be involved in activation by thrombin and plasmin. Here, we demonstrate that factor Xa mediates MT1-MMP-independent processing of pro-MMP-2 in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. Factor Xa and thrombin directly cleaved the propeptide on the carboxyl terminal sides of the Arg(98) and Arg(101) residues, whereas plasmin only cleaved the propeptide downstream of Arg(101). Moreover, processed MMP-2 showed enzymatic activity that was enhanced by intermolecular autoproteolytic processing at the Asn(109)-Tyr peptide bond. In addition to its role in activation, factor Xa rapidly degraded MMP-2, thereby restricting excessive MMP-2 activity. Thrombin also degraded MMP-2, but the degradation was reduced greatly under cell-associated conditions, resulting in an increase in processed MMP-2. Overall, factor Xa and thrombin regulate MMP-2 enzymatic activity through its activation and degradation. Thus, the net enzymatic activity results from a balance between MMP-2 activation and degradation.
