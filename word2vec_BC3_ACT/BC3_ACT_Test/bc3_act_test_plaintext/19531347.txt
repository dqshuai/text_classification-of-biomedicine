Genetic DISC-section of regeneration in Drosophila.

G Nachtrab, KD Poss

Although regeneration has long fascinated biologists, it remains a challenging field of study with much yet to learn at the molecular level. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Smith-Bolton et al. introduce a genetic ablation system in Drosophila melanogaster with the potential for large-scale identification of new regulators of regeneration.
