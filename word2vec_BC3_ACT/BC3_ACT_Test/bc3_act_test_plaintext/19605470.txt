We previously reported that CD4C/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)(Nef) transgenic (Tg) mice, expressing Nef in CD4(+) T cells and cells of the macrophage/dendritic cell (DC) lineage, develop a severe AIDS-like disease, characterized by depletion of CD4(+) T cells, as well as lung, heart, and kidney diseases. In order to determine the contribution of distinct populations of hematopoietic cells to the development of this AIDS-like disease, five additional Tg strains expressing Nef through restricted cell-specific regulatory elements were generated. These Tg strains express Nef in CD4(+) T cells, DCs, and macrophages (CD4E/HIV(Nef)); in CD4(+) T cells and DCs (mCD4/HIV(Nef) and CD4F/HIV(Nef)); in macrophages and DCs (CD68/HIV(Nef)); or mainly in DCs (CD11c/HIV(Nef)). None of these Tg strains developed significant lung and kidney diseases, suggesting the existence of as-yet-unidentified Nef-expressing cell subset(s) that are responsible for inducing organ disease in CD4C/HIV(Nef) Tg mice. Mice from all five strains developed persistent oral carriage of Candida albicans, suggesting an impaired immune function. Only strains expressing Nef in CD4(+) T cells showed CD4(+) T-cell depletion, activation, and apoptosis. These results demonstrate that expression of Nef in CD4(+) T cells is the primary determinant of their depletion. Therefore, the pattern of Nef expression in specific cell population(s) largely determines the nature of the resulting pathological changes.
