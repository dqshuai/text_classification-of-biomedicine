Limb development: the rise and fall of retinoic acid.

M Lewandoski, S Mackem

Retinoic acid was thought to play a key instructive role during limb bud initiation and subsequent patterning. New results argue instead that its role is permissive: retinoic acid is essential only to antagonize early axial Fgf signals that otherwise inhibit the limb field.
