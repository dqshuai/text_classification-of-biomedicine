Chromosome segregation: monopolin goes spindle.

A Khmelinskii, E Schiebel

At anaphase onset the mitotic spindle undergoes dramatic changes in order to segregate sister chromatids. Surprisingly, the monopolin complex, best known for its role at kinetochores in meiosis, is now shown to localize to, and stabilize, the mitotic anaphase spindle.
