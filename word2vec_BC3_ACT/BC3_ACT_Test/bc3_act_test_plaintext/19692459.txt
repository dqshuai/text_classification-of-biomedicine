Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections impair plasmacytoid dendritic cell (PDC) and natural killer (NK) cell subset numbers and functions, though little is known about PDC-NK cell interactions during these infections. We evaluated PDC-dependent NK cell killing and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and granzyme B production, using peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based and purified cell assays of samples from HCV- and HIV-infected subjects. CpG-enhanced PBMC killing and IFN-gamma and granzyme B activity (dependent on PDC and NK cells) were impaired in viremic HIV infection. In purified PDC-NK cell culture experiments, CpG-enhanced, PDC-dependent NK cell activity was cell contact and IFN-alpha dependent, and this activity was impaired in viremic HIV infection but not in HCV infection. In heterologous PDC-NK cell assays, impaired PDC-NK cell killing activity was largely attributable to an NK cell defect, while impaired PDC-NK cell IFN-gamma-producing activity was attributable to both PDC and NK cell defects. Additionally, the response of NK cells to direct IFN-alpha stimulation was defective in viremic HIV infection, and this defect was not attributable to diminished IFN-alpha receptor expression, though IFN-alpha receptor and NKP30 expression was closely associated with killer activity in viremic HIV infection but not in healthy controls. These data indicate that during uncontrolled HIV infection, PDC-dependent NK cell function is impaired, which is in large part attributable to defective IFN-alpha-induced NK cell activity and not to altered IFN-alpha receptor, NKP30, NKP44, NKP46, or NKG2D expression.
