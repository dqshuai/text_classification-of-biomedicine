SASPense and DDRama in cancer and ageing.

M Fumagalli, F d'Adda di Fagagna

Senescent cells alter their microenvironment by secreting a growing collection of factors, a phenomenon termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Cellular senescence is often the result of nuclear DNA damage fuelling a chronic DNA damage response (DDR). Upstream elements of the DDR cascade are necessary for full blown SASP, and additional crosstalk occurs between the DDR and cytokine secretion.
