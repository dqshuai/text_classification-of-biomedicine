In skeletal muscle development, the genes and regulatory factors that govern the specification of myocytes are well described. Despite this knowledge, the mechanisms that regulate the coordinated assembly of myofiber proteins into the functional contractile unit or sarcomere remain undefined. Here we explored the hypothesis that modular domain proteins such as Bin1 coordinate protein interactions to promote sarcomere formation. We demonstrate that Bin1 facilitates sarcomere organization through protein-protein interactions as mediated by the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. We observed a profound disorder in myofiber size and structural organization in a murine model expressing the Bin1 SH3 region. In addition, satellite cell-derived myogenesis was limited despite the accumulation of skeletal muscle-specific proteins. Our experiments revealed that the Bin1 SH3 domain formed transient protein complexes with both actin and myosin filaments and the pro-myogenic kinase Cdk5. Bin1 also associated with a Cdk5 phosphorylation domain of titin. Collectively, these observations suggest that Bin1 displays protein scaffold-like properties and binds with sarcomeric factors important in directing sarcomere protein assembly and myofiber maturation.
