Despite an excellent initial response to first-line hormonal treatment, most patients with metastatic prostate cancer will succumb to a hormone-refractory form of the disease. Because these tumors are still dependent on a functional androgen receptor (AR), there is a need to find novel and more potent antiandrogens. While searching for small molecules that bind to the AR and inhibit its transcriptional activity, BMS-641988 was discovered. This novel antiandrogen showed an increased (>1 log) potency compared with the standard antiandrogen, bicalutamide, in both binding affinity to the AR and inhibition of AR-mediated transactivation in cell-based reporter assays. In mature rats, BMS-641988 strongly inhibited androgen-dependent growth of the ventral prostate and seminal vesicles. In the CWR-22-BMSLD1 human prostate cancer xenograft model, BMS-641988 showed increased efficacy over bicalutamide (average percent tumor growth inhibition >90% versus <50%), even at exposure levels of bicalutamide 3-fold greater than what can be attained in humans. Furthermore, BMS-641988 was efficacious in CWR-22-BMSLD1 tumors initially refractory to treatment with bicalutamide. BMS-641988 was highly efficacious in the LuCaP 23.1 human prostate xenograft model, inducing stasis throughout the approximately 30-day dosing. To explore the functional mechanisms of BMS-641988, gene expression profiling analysis was done on CWR-22-BMSLD1 xenograft models in mice. Treatment with BMS-641988 resulted in a global gene expression profile more similar to castration compared with that of bicalutamide. Overall, these data highlight that the unique preclinical profile of BMS-641988 may provide additional understanding for the hormonal treatment of prostate cancer.
