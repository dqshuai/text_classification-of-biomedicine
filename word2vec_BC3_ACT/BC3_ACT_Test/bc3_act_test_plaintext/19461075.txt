Inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytosis enhance TGFbeta signaling and responses.

Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is believed to be involved in TGFbeta-stimulated cellular responses, but the subcellular locus at which TGFbeta induces signaling remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, which are known to arrest the progression of endocytosis at coated-pit stages, inhibit internalization of cell-surface-bound TGFbeta and promote colocalization and accumulation of TbetaR-I and SARA at the plasma membrane. These inhibitors enhance TGFbeta-induced signaling and cellular responses (Smad2 phosphorylation/nuclear localization and expression of PAI-1). Dynasore, a newly identified inhibitor of dynamin GTPase activity, is one of the most potent inhibitors among those tested and, furthermore, is a potent enhancer of TGFbeta. Dynasore ameliorates atherosclerosis in the aortic endothelium of hypercholesterolemic ApoE-null mice by counteracting the suppressed TGFbeta responsiveness caused by the hypercholesterolemia, presumably acting through its effect on TGFbeta endocytosis and signaling in vascular cells.
