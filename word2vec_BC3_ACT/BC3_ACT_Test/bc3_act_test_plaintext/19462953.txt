Synthesis and noncovalent protein conjugation of linear-hyperbranched PEG-poly(glycerol) alpha,omega(n)-telechelics.

F Wurm, J Klos, HJ RÃ¤der, H Frey

Linear-hyperbranched, heterobifunctional alpha,omega(n) telechelic block copolymers consisting of a linear poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain and a hyperbranched polyglycerol (PG) block have been prepared in five steps, using a protected amino-functional initiator. The polyfunctionality omega(n) (OH groups) can be adjusted by the degree of polymerization (DP(n)) of the polyglycerol block. Subsequent introduction of a single biotin unit by amidation in alpha-position permitted noncovalent bioconjugation with avidin.
