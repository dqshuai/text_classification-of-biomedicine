MS-based proteomics has become an indispensable tool in system biology generating a need for accurate and precise quantitation of peptide standards. The presented method utilizes ultra performance LC-MS/MS (UPLC-MS/MS) to accurately quantify peptide standards at concentrations of 0.1-10 microM. The ability for accurate quantitation of micro-molar concentrations has the advantages that quantitation can be performed routinely with high precision and the high sensitivity of the method minimizes the amounts required.
