Expression and phosphorylation of the Na+-Cl- cotransporter NCC in vivo is regulated by dietary salt, potassium, and SGK1.

The Na-Cl cotransporter NCC is expressed in the distal convoluted tubule, activated by phosphorylation, and has been implicated in renal NaCl and K(+) homeostasis. The serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) contributes to renal NaCl retention and K(+) excretion, at least in part, by stimulating the epithelial Na(+) channel and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in the downstream segments of aldosterone-sensitive Na(+)/K(+) exchange. In this study we confirmed in wild-type mice (WT) that dietary NaCl restriction increases renal NCC expression and its phosphorylation at Thr(53), Thr(58), and Ser(71), respectively. This response, however, was attenuated in mice lacking SGK1 (Sgk1(-/-)), which may contribute to impaired NaCl retention in those mice. Total renal NCC expression and phosphorylation at Thr(53), Thr(58), and Ser(71) in WT were greater under low- compared with high-K(+) diet. This finding is consistent with a regulation of NCC to modulate Na(+) delivery to downstream segments of Na(+)/K(+) exchange, thereby modulating K(+) excretion. Dietary K(+)-dependent variation in renal expression of total NCC and phosphorylated NCC were not attenuated in Sgk1(-/-) mice. In fact, high-K(+) diet-induced NCC suppression was enhanced in Sgk1(-/-) mice. The hyperkalemia induced in Sgk1(-/-) mice by a high-K(+) diet may have augmented NCC suppression, thereby increasing Na(+) delivery and facilitating K(+) excretion in downstream segments of impaired Na(+)/K(+) exchange. In summary, changes in NaCl and K(+) intake altered NCC expression and phosphorylation, an observation consistent with a role of NCC in NaCl and K(+) homeostasis. The two maneuvers dissociated plasma aldosterone levels from NCC expression and phosphorylation, implicating additional regulators. Regulation of NCC expression and phosphorylation by dietary NaCl restriction appears to involve SGK1.
