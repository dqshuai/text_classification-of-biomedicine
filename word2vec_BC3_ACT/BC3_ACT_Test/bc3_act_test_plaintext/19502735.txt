Human cytomegalovirus is a common human pathogen that can cause life-threatening disease under certain conditions. During infection of host cells, the virus expresses regulatory proteins such as IE72 and IE86 that are important for viral propagation. IE86 plays a critical role in the modulation of viral replication as well as host cell cycle control and apoptosis. In this study, a Tet-On system was used to quantify the effect of IE86 on apoptosis and p53 expression. Our results indicate that IE86 inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha induced apoptosis and that the anti-apoptotic activity of this viral protein correlates with its expression levels. In addition, IE86 did not alter the mRNA level of p53. The system developed should provide a method for functional analysis of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE86 protein.
