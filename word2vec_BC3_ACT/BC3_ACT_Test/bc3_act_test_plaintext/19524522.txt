Neurons that fire together also conspire together: is normal sleep circuitry hijacked to generate epilepsy?

MP Beenhakker, JR Huguenard

Brain circuits oscillate during sleep. The same circuits appear to generate pathological oscillations. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of how epilepsy co-opts normal, sleep-related circuits to generate seizures.
