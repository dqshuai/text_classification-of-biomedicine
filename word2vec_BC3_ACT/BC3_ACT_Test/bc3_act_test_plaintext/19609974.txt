Proteomics

Wellcome Trust/EBI 2009 Meeting Report - Perspectives in Stem Cell Proteomics: 22-23 March 2009, Wellcome Trust Conference Centre, Hinxton, UK.

E de Wynter, R Unwin

This report summarises the recent "Perspectives in Stem Cell Proteomics" meeting that was held at the Wellcome Trust Conference Centre, Hinxton, UK in March 2009. The aim of the meeting was to explore the current status of proteomics in stem cell biology. Several themes encompassing technological and biological studies demonstrated the close relationship that must exist between the two communities in order to maximise our understanding of stem cell behaviour. Highlights included new methods for induction of pluripotent stem cells, new data sets regarding protein expression and phosphorylation dynamics in differentiating cells and the potential for future exploitation in a therapeutic setting.
