Protein ubiquitylation is essential for many events linked to intracellular protein trafficking. Despite the significance of this process, the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of ubiquitylation remain largely unknown. Plasma membrane transporters are subjected to tightly regulated endocytosis, and ubiquitylation is a key signal at several stages of the endocytic pathway. The yeast monocarboxylate transporter Jen1 displays glucose-regulated endocytosis. We show here that casein kinase 1-dependent phosphorylation and HECT-ubiquitin ligase Rsp5-dependent ubiquitylation are required for Jen1 endocytosis. Ubiquitylation and endocytosis of Jen1 are induced within minutes in response to glucose addition. Jen1 is modified at the cell surface by oligo-ubiquitylation with ubiquitin-Lys(63) linked chain(s), and Jen1-Lys(338) is one of the target residues. Ubiquitin-Lys(63)-linked chain(s) are also required directly or indirectly to sort Jen1 into multivesicular bodies. Jen1 is one of the few examples for which ubiquitin-Lys(63)-linked chain(s) was shown to be required for correct trafficking at two stages of endocytosis: endocytic internalization and sorting at multivesicular bodies.
