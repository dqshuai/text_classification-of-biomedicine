Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) was the first disease to be linked to the presence of a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation. Nowadays over 95% of LHON cases are known to be caused by one of three primary mutations (m.11778G>A, m.14484T>C, and m.3460G>A). Reports for other (rare) primary mutations in LHON patients are not infrequent. Among those is the mutation m.3635G>A in the MT-ND1 gene which was reported to be pathogenic in a Russian LHON family. In this study, we report on a Chinese family with clinical features of LHON but without any of the three well-known primary mutations. Analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome in the proband revealed the presence of m.3635G>A and m.6228C>T, along with a full array of other variants that suggest the haplogroup M7b1. Evolutionary analysis indicates that site 3635, but not 6228, is highly conserved in vertebrates. Protein secondary-structure modeling for the MT-ND1 protein harboring amino acid change S110N indicates that mutant m.3635G>A decreases the protein hydrophobicity. Our current observations provide further support for a pathogenic role of m.3635G>A in patients with LHON.
