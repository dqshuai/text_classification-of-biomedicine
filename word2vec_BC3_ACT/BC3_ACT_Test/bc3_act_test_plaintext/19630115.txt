Primary neoplasms arising in the anal canal are relatively unusual. In particular, adenomas and adenocarcinomas are distinctly rare entities in this region. We describe an infiltrating, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma arising in a villous adenoma from the distal anal canal, in an otherwise healthy patient at low risk for gastrointestinal malignancy. This is the case of an octogenarian man with a several year history of hemorrhoids and intermittent rectal bleeding, more recently complaining of continuous hematochezia. Examination revealed a blood-covered pedunculated mass with a long stalk protruding from the anus. The lesion was amputated at the bedside. Microscopic evaluation revealed an infiltrating well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, arising from a villous adenoma. This was further evaluated under anesthesia and complete excision of distal anal tissue was performed. Our report is the first describing the possible malignant degeneration of a villous adenoma in the anal canal.
