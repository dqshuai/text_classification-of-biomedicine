X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is a key signal transducer in endoplasmic reticulum stress response, and its potential role in the atherosclerosis development is unknown. This study aims to explore the impact of XBP1 on maintaining endothelial integrity related to atherosclerosis and to delineate the underlying mechanism. We found that XBP1 was highly expressed at branch points and areas of atherosclerotic lesions in the arteries of ApoE(-/-) mice, which was related to the severity of lesion development. In vitro study using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) indicated that disturbed flow increased the activation of XBP1 expression and splicing. Overexpression of spliced XBP1 induced apoptosis of HUVECs and endothelial loss from blood vessels during ex vivo cultures because of caspase activation and down-regulation of VE-cadherin resulting from transcriptional suppression and matrix metalloproteinase-mediated degradation. Reconstitution of VE-cadherin by Ad-VEcad significantly increased Ad-XBP1s-infected HUVEC survival. Importantly, Ad-XBP1s gene transfer to the vessel wall of ApoE(-/-) mice resulted in development of atherosclerotic lesions after aorta isografting. These results indicate that XBP1 plays an important role in maintaining endothelial integrity and atherosclerosis development, which provides a potential therapeutic target to intervene in atherosclerosis.
