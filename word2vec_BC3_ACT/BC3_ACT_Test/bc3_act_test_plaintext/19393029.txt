The genetic absence epilepsy rat from Strasbourg is considered an isomorphic, predictive, and homologous model of typical childhood absence epilepsy. It is characterized by the expression of spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) in the thalamus and cortex. The ketogenic diet (KD) is successfully used in humans and animals with various types of seizures, but was not effective in children with intractable atypical absence epilepsy. Here, we studied its potential impact on the occurrence of SWDs in genetic absence epilepsy rat from Strasbourg. Rats were fed the KD for 3 weeks during which they were regularly subjected to the electroencephalographic recording of SWDs. The KD did not influence the number and duration of SWDs despite a 15-22% decrease in plasma glucose levels and a large increase in beta-hydroxybutyrate levels. Likewise, the KD did not affect the level of expression of the blood-brain barrier glucose transporter GLUT1 or of the monocarboxylate transporters, MCT1 and MCT2. This report extends the observation in humans that the KD does not appear to show effectiveness in intractable atypical absence epilepsy to this model of typical childhood absence epilepsy which responds to specific antiepileptic drugs.
