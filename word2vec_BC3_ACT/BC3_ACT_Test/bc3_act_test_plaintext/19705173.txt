Compound forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease have been recently associated with unusually severe neuropathies, an observation that prompted the proposition that the additive effects of two mutations should be searched in patients whose clinical severity falls outside the common CMT phenotypes. In this report, we present a father and a daughter with a very mild and unusual disease that segregates with two mutations in PMP22 gene, the 17p11.2-p12 duplication and a Ser72Leu point mutation. We propose that the deleterious effects of each mutation are partially compensated by the functional effect of the other.
