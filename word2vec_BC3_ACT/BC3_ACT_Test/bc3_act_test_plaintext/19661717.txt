Isolation and structural elucidation of a new cyclohexenone compound from Lasiodiplodia theobromae.

N Kitaoka, K Nabeta, H Matsuura

A new cyclohexenone compound was isolated as a mixture of enantiomers from a culture filtrate of Lasiodiplodia theobromae. The relative structure was determined to be 4,5-dihydroxy-3-methyl-cyclohex-2-enone on the basis of MS, (1)H-NMR, and (13)C-NMR spectroscopic analyses, including 2D-NMR experiments. Resolution of the enantiomers was conducted by a coupling reaction with (S)-MTPA-Cl followed by HPLC separation.
