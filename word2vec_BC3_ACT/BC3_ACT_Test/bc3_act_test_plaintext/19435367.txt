Versatile Pd(OTf)2 x 2 H2O-catalyzed ortho-fluorination using NMP as a promoter.

X Wang, TS Mei, JQ Yu

Pd(OTf)(2) x 2 H(2)O-catalyzed ortho-fluorination of triflamide-protected benzylamines is reported. The use of N-fluoro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium triflate as the F(+) source and NMP as a promoter is crucial for this reaction. The conversion of triflamide into a wide range of synthetically useful functional groups makes this fluorination protocol broadly applicable in medicinal chemistry and synthesis.
