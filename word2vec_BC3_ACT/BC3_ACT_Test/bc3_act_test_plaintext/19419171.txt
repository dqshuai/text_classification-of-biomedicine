High specificity, electrochemical sandwich assays based on single aptamer sequences and suitable for the direct detection of small-molecule targets in blood and other complex matrices.

We herein demonstrate a sandwich assay based on single aptamer sequences is suitable for the direct detection of small molecule targets in blood serum and other complex matrices. By splitting an aptamer into two pieces, we convert a single affinity reagent into a two-component system in which the presence of the target drives formation of a complex comprised of the target and the two halves of the aptamer. To demonstrate the utility of this approach we have used single anticocaine and anti-ATP aptamers to fabricate electrochemical sensors directed against the representative small molecules cocaine and ATP. Both targets are detected at low micromolar concentrations, in seconds, and in a convenient, general, readily reusable, electrochemical format. Moreover, both sensors are selective enough to deploy directly in blood, crude cellular lysates and other complex sample matrices.
