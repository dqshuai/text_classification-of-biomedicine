IL-17 receptor signaling is required to control polymicrobial sepsis.

Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response resulting from the inability of the host to contain the infection locally. Previously, we demonstrated that during severe sepsis there is a marked failure of neutrophil migration to the infection site, which contributes to dissemination of infection, resulting in high mortality. IL-17 plays an important role in neutrophil recruitment. Herein, we investigated the role of IL-17R signaling in polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). It was observed that IL-17R-deficient mice, subjected to CLP-induced non-severe sepsis, show reduced neutrophil recruitment into the peritoneal cavity, spread of infection, and increased systemic inflammatory response as compared with C57BL/6 littermates. As a consequence, the mice showed an increased mortality rate. The ability of IL-17 to induce neutrophil migration was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. Beside its role in neutrophil recruitment to the infection focus, IL-17 enhanced the microbicidal activity of the migrating neutrophils by a mechanism dependent on NO. Therefore, IL-17 plays a critical role in host protection during polymicrobial sepsis.
