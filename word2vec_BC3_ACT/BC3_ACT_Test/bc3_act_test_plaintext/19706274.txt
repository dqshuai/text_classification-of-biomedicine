Notch signalling: receptor cis-inhibition to achieve directionality.

D del Alamo, F Schweisguth

Lateral inhibition, by which single cells become distinct from their neighbours, can be mediated by Notch signalling during animal development. Signalling directionality is presumably achieved by downregulation of the Notch ligand in signal-receiving cells. New evidence suggests that cis-inhibition of the receptor in the ligand-sending cell might also provide directionality.
