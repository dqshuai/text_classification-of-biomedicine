The central role of Bcl-3 in atopic dermatitis.

R Massoumi

Cytokines and hormones are essential mediators in the regulation of antimicrobial peptide and protein (AMP) levels during host defense responses. In this issue, BÃ¼chau et al. identify and characterize B-cell leukemia-3 as an important modulator of AMP expression during the innate immune response in keratinocytes as well as in the chronic inflammatory skin disorder atopic dermatitis.
