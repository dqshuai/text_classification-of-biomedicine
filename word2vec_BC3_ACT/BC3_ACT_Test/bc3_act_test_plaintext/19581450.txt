Is there variation in crossover interference levels among chromosomes from human males?

EA Housworth, FW Stahl

We demonstrate that recent data from human males are consistent with constant interference levels among chromosomes under the two-pathway model, whereas inappropriately fitting shape parameters of Gamma distributions to immunofluorescent interfoci distances observed on finite chromosomes generates false interpretations of higher levels of interference on shorter chromosomes. We provide appropriate statistical methodology.
