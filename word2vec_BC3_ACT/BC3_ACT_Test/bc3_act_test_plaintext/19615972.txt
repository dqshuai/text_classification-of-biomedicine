Positive and negative cooperativity of modularly assembled zinc fingers.

One simple and widespread method to create engineered zinc fingers targeting the desired DNA sequences is to modularly assemble multiple finger modules pre-selected to recognize each DNA triplet. However, it has become known that a sufficient DNA binding affinity is not always obtained. In order to create successful zinc finger proteins, it is important to understand the context-dependent contribution of each finger module to the DNA binding ability of the assembled zinc finger proteins. Here, we have created finger-deletion mutants of zinc finger proteins and examined the DNA bindings of these zinc fingers to clarify the contributions of each finger module. Our results indicate that not only a positive cooperativity but also a context-dependent reduction in the DNA binding activity can be induced by assembling zinc finger modules.
