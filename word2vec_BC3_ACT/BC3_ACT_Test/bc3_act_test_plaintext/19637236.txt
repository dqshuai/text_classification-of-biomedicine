Photonic immobilization of high-density protein arrays using Fourier optics.

E Skovsen, AB Kold, MT Neves-Petersen, SB Petersen

The technique of UV-light-assisted immobilization of disulfide containing proteins has been combined with the Fourier-transforming properties of lenses as well as with a simple millimeter scale feature size spatial mask. The result is a new simple and inexpensive way of creating high-density protein arrays with feature sizes down to a few hundred nanometers, which represents an improvement of tenfold over existing commercially available high-density protein arraying methods.
