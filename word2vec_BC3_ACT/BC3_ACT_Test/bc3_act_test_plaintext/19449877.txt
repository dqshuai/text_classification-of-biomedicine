We report here our full results concerning the possibility of generating in situ from a stable and readily available ruthenium(II) source a highly active ruthenium catalyst for C-H bond activation. The versatility of this catalytic system has been demonstrated, as it offers the possibility of modifying the electronic and steric properties of the catalyst by fine-tuning of the ligands, allowing functionalization of various substrates. Aromatic ketones and imines could be easily functionalized by the reaction with either vinylsilanes or styrenes, depending on the electronic and steric nature of the ligand. Moreover, variable-temperature NMR experiments and the isolation of a ruthenium intermediate complex provided some insights into the generation of the active catalytic ruthenium species in this reaction.
