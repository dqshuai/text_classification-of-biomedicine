Inhibitory plasticity in auditory cortex.

I Nelken

Arguably the most important property of neuronal circuits in general, and of cortical circuits in particular, is plasticity--the ability to change in response to past experience. While many studies of plasticity emphasize changes in excitatory transmission, in this issue of Neuron, Galindo-Leon et al. demonstrate the important role that increased inhibition may play in shaping cortical responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli.
