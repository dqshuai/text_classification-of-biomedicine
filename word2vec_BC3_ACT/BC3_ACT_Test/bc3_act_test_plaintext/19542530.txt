Secreted versus membrane-anchored collagenases: relative roles in fibroblast-dependent collagenolysis and invasion.

Fibroblasts degrade type I collagen, the major extracellular protein found in mammals, during events ranging from bulk tissue resorption to invasion through the three-dimensional extracellular matrix. Current evidence suggests that type I collagenolysis is mediated by secreted as well as membrane-anchored members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene family. However, the roles played by these multiple and possibly redundant, degradative systems during fibroblast-mediated matrix remodeling is undefined. Herein, we use fibroblasts isolated from Mmp13(-/-), Mmp8(-/-), Mmp2(-/-), Mmp9(-/-), Mmp14(-/-) and Mmp16(-/-) mice to define the functional roles for secreted and membrane-anchored collagenases during collagen-resorptive versus collagen-invasive events. In the presence of a functional plasminogen activator-plasminogen axis, secreted collagenases arm cells with a redundant collagenolytic potential that allows fibroblasts harboring single deficiencies for either MMP-13, MMP-8, MMP-2, or MMP-9 to continue to degrade collagen comparably to wild-type fibroblasts. Likewise, Mmp14(-/-) or Mmp16(-/-) fibroblasts retain near-normal collagenolytic activity in the presence of plasminogen via the mobilization of secreted collagenases, but only Mmp14 (MT1-MMP) plays a required role in the collagenolytic processes that support fibroblast invasive activity. Furthermore, by artificially tethering a secreted collagenase to the surface of Mmp14(-/-) fibroblasts, we demonstrate that localized pericellular collagenolytic activity differentiates the collagen-invasive phenotype from bulk collagen degradation. Hence, whereas secreted collagenases arm fibroblasts with potent matrix-resorptive activity, only MT1-MMP confers the focal collagenolytic activity necessary for supporting the tissue-invasive phenotype.
