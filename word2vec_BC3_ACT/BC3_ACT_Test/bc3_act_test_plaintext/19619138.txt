Individuals with Down syndrome develop beta-amyloid deposition characteristic of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) in mid-life, presumably because of an extra copy of the chromosome 21-located amyloid precursor protein (App) gene. App mRNA and APP metabolite levels were assessed in the brains of Ts65Dn mice, a mouse model of Down syndrome, using quantitative PCR, western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, and ELISAs. In spite of the additional App gene copy, App mRNA, APP holoprotein, and all APP metabolite levels in the brains of 4-month-old trisomic mice were not increased compared with the levels seen in diploid littermate controls. However starting at 10 months of age, brain APP levels were increased proportional to the App gene dosage imbalance reflecting increased App message levels in Ts65Dn mice. Similar to APP levels, soluble amino-terminal fragments of APP (sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta) were increased in Ts65Dn mice compared with diploid mice at 12 months but not at 4 months of age. Brain levels of both Abeta40 and Abeta42 were not increased in Ts65Dn mice compared with diploid mice at all ages examined. Therefore, multiple mechanisms contribute to the regulation towards diploid levels of APP metabolites in the Ts65Dn mouse brain.
