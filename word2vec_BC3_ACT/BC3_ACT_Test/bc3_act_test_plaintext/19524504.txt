p62 at the crossroads of autophagy, apoptosis, and cancer.

J Moscat, MT Diaz-Meco

The signaling adaptor p62 is a multidomain protein implicated in the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Recent findings link p62 activity to the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, and Mathew et al. (2009) now show that the modulation of p62 by autophagy is a key factor in tumorigenesis. These findings place p62 at critical decision points that control cell death and survival.
