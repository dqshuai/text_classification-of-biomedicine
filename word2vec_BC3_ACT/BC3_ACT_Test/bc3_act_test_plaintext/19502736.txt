We have reported that heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) and annexin II are involved in the protection of human cells against UVC-induced cell death. In this study we tried to confirm the combined roles of HSP27 and annexin II in cell death after UVC irradiation. In RSa cells with sensitivity to UVC, expression of annexin II decreased after UVC irradiation, but not in AP(r)-1 cells with increased resistance to UVC. HSP27 siRNA-transfected AP(r)-1 cells were sensitized to UVC lethality and showed decreased annexin II expression after UVC irradiation. In contrast, transfection of RSa cells with HSP27 cDNA increased their resistance to UVC lethality and caused increased annexin II expression. Furthermore, over-production of annexin II in RSa cells resulted in increased resistance to UVC lethality. This study indicates the involvement of cellular HSP27 expression in the UVC susceptibility of human cells, which occurs in association with regulation of annexin II expression.
