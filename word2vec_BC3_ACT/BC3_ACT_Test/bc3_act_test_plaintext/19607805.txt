Notch ligand-dependent gene expression in human endometrial stromal cells.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the expression patterns and role of Notch signaling in human endometrial cells. Notch receptors, Notch 1-3 were expressed in both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells. Notch ligands, Jag1 and Dll4 and Notch target genes, Hes1 and Hey1 were predominantly expressed in endometrial epithelial cells and scarce in stromal cells. Increased de novo synthesis of Dll4 or Jag1 in stromal cells by retroviral delivery significantly induced Hes1 and Hey1. Evaluations of global gene expression by microarrays revealed that more than 400 genes in stromal cells were significantly regulated by Jag1. Gene annotation-based functional analysis classified these genes into biological processes of cell adhesion, cell structure and motility, cell communication, cell cycle, and angiogenesis. This study provides evidence that Notch ligands control the Notch gene activities and may enhance development of human endometrium.
