It was found that C-reactive protein (CRP) could significantly increase the expression and activity of tissue factor (TF), but decrease that of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in dose- and time-dependent manners, which could be antagonized by PDTC and U0126. CRP could also increase protein expression of phosphorylated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), IkappaB-alpha and ERK1/2 in dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, neutralizing antibody to CD32 (FcgammaR II) could significantly attenuate the expression and activity of TF and TFPI induced by CRP. These results suggest that CRP may promote coagulation by enhancing the expression and activity of TF and reducing that of TFPI by activating NF-kappaB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase via FcgammaR II.
