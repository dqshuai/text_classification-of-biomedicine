Synthetic approach to telomerase inhibitor dictyodendrin B: synthesis of the pyrrolo[2,3-c]carbazole core.

S Hirao, Y Sugiyama, M Iwao, F Ishibashi

The core structure of the telomerase inhibitor, dictyodendrin B, was synthesized by using the palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of 3-aryl-1-(2-arylethyl)-4-hydroxy-2,5-bismethoxycarbonylpyrrole triflate with 7-alkoxyindole-3-boronate as the key step.
