Neuron

Inhibition acts globally to shape olfactory cortical tuning.

NE Schoppa

Lateral inhibition between near-neighbor neurons has long been thought to be important for narrowing the receptive fields of neurons in many sensory systems. A new study by Poo and Isaacson in this issue of Neuron examining olfactory processing finds that "global" inhibition within the primary olfactory cortex might accomplish a similar end.
