High expression of the estrogen receptor-related receptor (ERR)-alpha in human tumors is correlated to a poor prognosis, suggesting an involvement of the receptor in cell proliferation. In this study, we show that a synthetic compound (XCT790) that modulates the activity of ERRalpha reduces the proliferation of various cell lines and blocks the G(1)/S transition of the cell cycle in an ERRalpha-dependent manner. XCT790 induces, in a p53-independent manner, the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(waf/cip)(1) at the protein, mRNA, and promoter level, leading to an accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb. Finally, XCT790 reduces cell tumorigenicity in Nude mice.
