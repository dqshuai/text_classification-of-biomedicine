Four peptides corresponding to highly conserved motives within the first two RNA recognition motif-type domains of ELAV proteins were prepared, and their effect on the stability of NOVA-1 and VEGF ELAV-target mRNAs was evaluated. Biological results show that in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (a PKC activator triggering the ELAV pathway), an equimolar mixture of peptides induces a statistically significant stabilization of the selected transcripts, suggesting a synergic effect of the two stimuli.
