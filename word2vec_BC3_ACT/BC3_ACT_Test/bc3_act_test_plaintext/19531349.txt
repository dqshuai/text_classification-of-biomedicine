You don't need a PHD to grow a tumor.

JW Kim, RS Johnson

Prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) perceive intracellular oxygen tension and signal hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) to induce hypoxia-adaptive processes such as angiogenesis. A paper from Chan and colleagues in the June issue of Cancer Cell demonstrates that PHD2 inactivation in tumor cells accelerates tumor growth via HIF-independent, NF-kappaB-mediated changes in tumor angiogenesis.
