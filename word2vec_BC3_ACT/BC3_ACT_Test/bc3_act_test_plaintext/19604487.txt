Integr-ating IL-1 alpha in antiviral host defenses.

KA Fitzgerald

Adenoviral vectors used in gene therapy induce inflammation, although the underlying mechanisms are currently unknown. In this issue of Immunity, Di Paolo et al. (2009) implicate interleukin-1 alpha (IL- 1 alpha) in virus-induced inflammation and identify the beta 3 integrin as the key receptor regulating IL-1 alpha activity.
