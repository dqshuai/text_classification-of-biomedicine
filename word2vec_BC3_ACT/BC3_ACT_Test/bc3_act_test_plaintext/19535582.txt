The phospho-dependent dynamin-syndapin interaction triggers activity-dependent bulk endocytosis of synaptic vesicles.

Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are retrieved by more than one mode in central nerve terminals. During mild stimulation, the dominant SV retrieval pathway is classical clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). During elevated neuronal activity, activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) predominates, which requires activation of the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. We now report that calcineurin dephosphorylates dynamin I in nerve terminals only above the same activity threshold that triggers ADBE. ADBE was arrested when the two major phospho-sites on dynamin I were perturbed, suggesting that dynamin I dephosphorylation is a key step in its activation. Dynamin I dephosphorylation stimulates a specific dynamin I-syndapin I interaction. Inhibition of this interaction by competitive peptides or by site-directed mutagenesis exclusively inhibited ADBE but did not affect CME. The results reveal that the phospho-dependent dynamin-syndapin interaction recruits ADBE to massively increase SV endocytosis under conditions of elevated neuronal activity.
