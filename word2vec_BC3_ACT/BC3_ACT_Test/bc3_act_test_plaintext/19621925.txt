Protonated benzene dimer: an experimental and ab initio study.

The excitation spectrum of the protonated benzene dimer has been recorded in the 415-600 nm wavelength range. In contrast to the neutral iso-electronic benzene dimer, its absorption spectrum extends in the visible spectral region. This huge spectral shift has been interpreted with ab initio calculations, which indicate that the first excited states should be charge transfer states.
