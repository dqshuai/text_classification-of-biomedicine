Ni(0)-catalyzed formation of azaaluminacyclopentenes via azanickelacyclopentenes: a unique nickel/aluminum double transmetalation reaction.

M Ohashi, O Kishizaki, H Ikeda, S Ogoshi

Azaaluminacyclopentenes, which serve as useful precursors for gamma-substituted allylamines, were catalytically prepared from novel Ni-mediated three-component cyclocondensation of an alkyne, an imine, and AlMe(3).
