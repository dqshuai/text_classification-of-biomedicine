We have characterized the structure and the function of the 6.6-kDa protein SvtR (formerly called gp08) from the rod-shaped virus SIRV1, which infects the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus that thrives at 85 degrees C in hot acidic springs. The protein forms a dimer in solution. The NMR solution structure of the protein consists of a ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) fold between residues 13 and 56 and a disordered N-terminal region (residues 1-12). The structure is very similar to that of bacterial RHH proteins despite the low sequence similarity. We demonstrated that the protein binds DNA and uses its beta-sheet face for the interaction like bacterial RHH proteins. To detect all the binding sites on the 32.3-kb SIRV1 linear genome, we designed and performed a global genome-wide search of targets based on a simplified electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Four targets were recognized by the protein. The strongest binding was observed with the promoter of the gene coding for a virion structural protein. When assayed in a host reconstituted in vitro transcription system, the protein SvtR (Sulfolobus virus transcription regulator) repressed transcription from the latter promoter, as well as from the promoter of its own gene.
