Mg2+-assisted catalysis by B. stearothermophilus TrpRS is promoted by allosteric effects.

Mn(2+)-assisted catalysis by B. stearothermophilus TrpRS parallels that in polymerases and reduces specificity in amino acid activation. As predicted by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, multivariant thermodynamic cycles with [ATP]-dependent Michaelis-Menten kinetics and Mn(2+) for Mg(2+) substitution demonstrate energetic coupling of ATP affinities to the metal; to lysines K111 and K192, which interact via the PPi leaving group; and to K195, which couples differently to the metal via the alpha-phosphate. However, net coupling to the metal opposes catalysis in both ground (K(M)) and transition (k(cat)) states. The 10(5)-fold rate acceleration by Mg(2+)-protein interactions therefore requires additional favorable protein-metal couplings. Examples include longer-range, i.e., allosteric, interactions previously illustrated by the remote F37I mutation, which both reduces k(cat) and enhances catalytic assist by Mn(2+), relative to that by Mg(2+). These data support a model linking metal-assisted phosphoryl transfer catalysis to domain movement, and hence to free-energy transduction in a broad range of enzymes.
