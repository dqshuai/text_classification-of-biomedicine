Plant oxylipins: role of jasmonic acid during programmed cell death, defence and leaf senescence.

C Reinbothe, A Springer, I Samol, S Reinbothe

Plants are continuously challenged by a variety of abiotic and biotic cues. To deter feeding insects, nematodes and fungal and bacterial pathogens, plants have evolved a plethora of defence strategies. A central player in many of these defence responses is jasmonic acid. It is the aim of this minireview to summarize recent findings that highlight the role of jasmonic acid during programmed cell death, plant defence and leaf senescence.
