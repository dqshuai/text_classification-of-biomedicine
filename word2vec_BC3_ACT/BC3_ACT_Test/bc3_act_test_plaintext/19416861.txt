PKR, a p53 target gene, plays a crucial role in the tumor-suppressor function of p53.

Type I IFN-induced expression of dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) during viral infection is a well-established antiviral mechanism. However, little is known about the expression of PKR in the context of p53 and about PKR involvement in p53-mediated tumor suppression. Here, we report that PKR is a p53 target gene and plays an important role in the tumor-suppressor function of p53. Activation of p53 by genotoxic stress induces a significant level of PKR expression by acting on the newly identified cis-acting element (ISRE), which is separated from the IFN-stimulated responsive element on the PKR promoter, resulting in translational inhibition and cell apoptosis. The genotoxin-mediated inhibition of translation is associated with the p53/PKR/elF2a (eukaryotic initiation factor-2alpha) pathway. To some extent, p53 activation induced by DNA damage facilitates cell apoptosis by activating PKR. PKR-knockdown human colon cancer cells grew rapidly in nude mice and proved resistant to anti-cancer drugs. These data indicate that p53-mediated tumor suppression can be attributed at least in part to the biological functions of PKR induced by p53 in genotoxic conditions.
