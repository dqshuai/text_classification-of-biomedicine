Enantioselective alpha-arylation of aldehydes via organo-SOMO catalysis. An ortho-selective arylation reaction based on an open-shell pathway.

The intramolecular alpha-arylation of aldehydes has been accomplished using singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) catalysis. Selective oxidation of chiral enamines (formed by the condensation of an aldehyde and a secondary amine catalyst) leads to the formation of a 3pi-electron radical species. These chiral SOMO-activated radical cations undergo enantioselective reaction with an array of pendent electron-rich aromatics and heterocycles thus efficiently providing cyclic alpha-aryl aldehyde products (10 examples: > or = 70% yield and > or = 90% ee). In accordance with our radical mechanism, when there is a choice between arylation at the ortho or para position of anisole substrates, we find that arylation proceeds selectively at the ortho position.
