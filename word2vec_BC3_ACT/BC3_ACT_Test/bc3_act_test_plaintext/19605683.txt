Cell type specificity of PI3K signaling in Pdk1- and Pten-deficient brains.

Loss of PTEN causes unregulated activation of downstream components of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, including PDK1, and disrupts normal nervous system development and homeostasis. We tested the contribution of Pdk1 to the abnormalities induced by Pten deletion in the brain. Conditional deletion of Pdk1 caused microcephaly. Combined deletion of Pdk1 and Pten rescued hypertrophy, but not migration defects of Pten-deficient neurons. Pdk1 inactivation induced strikingly different effects on the regulation of phosphorylated Akt in glia versus neurons. Our results show Pdk1-dependent and Pdk1-independent abnormalities in Pten-deficient brains, and demonstrate cell type specific differences in feedback regulation of the ubiquitous PI3K pathway.
