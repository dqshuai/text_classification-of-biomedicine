RNAP subunits F/E (RPB4/7) are stably associated with archaeal RNA polymerase: using fluorescence anisotropy to monitor RNAP assembly in vitro.

D Grohmann, A Hirtreiter, F Werner

Archaeal and eukaryotic RNAPs (DNA-dependent RNA polymerases) are complex multi-subunit enzymes. Two of the subunits, F and E, which together form the F/E complex, have been hypothesized to associate with RNAP in a reversible manner during the transcription cycle. We have characterized the molecular interactions between the F/E complex and the RNAP core. F/E binds to RNAP with submicromolar affinity and is not in a dynamic exchange with unbound F/E.
