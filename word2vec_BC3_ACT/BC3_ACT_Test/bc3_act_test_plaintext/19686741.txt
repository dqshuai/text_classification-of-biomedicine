Lumcorin: a leucine-rich repeat 9-derived peptide from human lumican inhibiting melanoma cell migration.

We previously showed that lumican decreases melanoma progression. The aim of the present study was to determine the active sequence of the lumican core protein responsible for the inhibition of melanoma cell migration. Using different recombinant and synthetic peptides derived from lumican, we localized an active site in the leucine-rich repeat 9 domain of the lumican core protein. We propose the name lumcorin (fragment of lumican core protein) for the active peptide derived from this site. Lumcorin was able to inhibit melanoma cell migration in vitro.
