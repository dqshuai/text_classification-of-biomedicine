According to GOSPEL: filling in the GAP(DH) of NO-mediated neurotoxicity.

T Nakamura, SA Lipton

In addition to its role in glycolysis, GAPDH has been implicated as a mediator of neurotoxicity triggered by nitrosative stress. In this issue of Neuron, Sen et al. identify a novel, negative regulator of this GAPDH neurotoxic pathway termed GOSPEL, which, like GAPDH itself, is regulated by S-nitrosylation.
