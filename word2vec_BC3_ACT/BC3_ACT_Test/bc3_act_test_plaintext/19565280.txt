Humans with L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) mutations exhibit X-linked hydrocephalus, as well as other severe neurological disorders. L1-6D mutant mice, which are homozygous for a deletion that removes the sixth immunoglobulin-like domain of L1cam, seldom display hydrocephalus on the 129/Sv background. However, the same L1-6D mutation produces severe hydrocephalus on the C57BL/6J background. To begin to understand how L1cam deficiencies result in hydrocephalus and to identify modifier loci that contribute to X-linked hydrocephalus by genetically interacting with L1cam, we conducted a genome-wide scan on F2 L1-6D mice, bred from L1-6D 129S2/SvPasCrlf and C57BL/6J mice. Linkage studies, utilizing chi-square tests and quantitative trait loci mapping techniques, were performed. Candidate modifier loci were further investigated in an extension study. Linkage was confirmed for a locus on chromosome 5, which we named L1cam hydrocephalus modifier 1 (L1hydro1), p = 4.04 X 10(-11).
