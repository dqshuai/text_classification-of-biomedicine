The supramolecular nanoarchitectures, C(60)/ferrocene nanosheets, were prepared by a simple liquid-liquid interfacial precipitation method and fully characterized by means of SEM, STEM, HRTEM, XRD, Raman and UV-vis-NIR spectra. The highly crystallized C(60)/ferrocene hexagonal nanosheets had a size of ca. 9 microm and the formulation C(60)(ferrocene)(2). A strong charge-transfer (CT) band between ferrocene and C(60) was observed at 782 nm, indicating the presence of donor-acceptor interaction in the nanosheets. Upon heating the nanosheets to 150 degrees C, the CT band disappeared due to the sublimation of ferrocene from the C(60)/ferrocene hybrid, and C(60) nanosheets with an fcc crystal structure and the same shape and size as the C(60)/ferrocene nanosheets were obtained.
