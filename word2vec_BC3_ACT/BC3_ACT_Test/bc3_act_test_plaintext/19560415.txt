The guardian recruits cops: the p53-p21 axis delegates prosurvival duties to the Keap1-Nrf2 stress pathway.

MB Toledano

In this issue of Molecular Cell, Zhang and colleagues (Chen et al., 2009) report their identification of p21 as a positive regulator of Nrf2, which extends p53 prosurvival functions through recruitment of a master stress-response regulator.
