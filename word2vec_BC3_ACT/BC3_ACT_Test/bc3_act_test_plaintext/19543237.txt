Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a cytokine secreted primarily by T(H)-17 cells. Although IL-17 is primarily associated with the induction of tissue inflammation, the other biological roles of IL-17, including non-immune functions, have yet to be thoroughly explored. Here, we report that T-cell-produced IL-17 can induce proliferation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in a manner dependent on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Rac1 GTPase and NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) are activated by IL-17 to produce ROS, which in turn stimulates hMSC proliferation. The activation of the MEK-ERK pathway is also crucial for IL-17-dependent hMSC proliferation. TRAF6 and Act1 are required to activate Nox 1 and to phosphorylate MEK on IL-17 stimulation. Interestingly, IL-17 not only accelerates the proliferation of hMSCs, but also induces their migration, motility, and osteoblastic differentiation. Furthermore, IL-17 induces the expression of M-CSF and receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) on hMSCs, thereby supporting osteoclastogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. On the basis of these results, we suggest that IL-17 can function as a signal to induce extensive bone turnover by regulating hMSC recruitment, proliferation, motility, and differentiation.
