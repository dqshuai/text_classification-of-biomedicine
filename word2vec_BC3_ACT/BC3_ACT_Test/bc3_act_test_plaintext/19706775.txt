ME Stefanek, MA Andrykowski, C Lerman, S Manne, K Glanz

The call for interdisciplinary research in the war on cancer has escalated over the past several years. Behavioral science has played a key role in cancer control, and several exciting opportunities exist and will develop with the ongoing significant advances made in biomedical science. The current article briefly reviews the maturity of behavioral science in the areas of prevention, early detection, and survivorship and how the partnership of behavioral and biomedical science can effectively impact cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality.
