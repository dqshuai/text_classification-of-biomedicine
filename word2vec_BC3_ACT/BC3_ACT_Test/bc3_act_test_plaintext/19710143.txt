Male-specific single-stranded RNA (FRNA) coliphages belong to the family Leviviridae. They are classified into two genera (Levivirus and Allolevivirus), which can be subdivided into four genogroups (genogroups I and II in Levivirus and genogroups III and IV in Allolevivirus). Relatively few strains have been completely characterized, and hence, a detailed knowledge of this virus family is lacking. In this study, we sequenced and characterized the complete genomes of 19 FRNA strains (10 Levivirus strains and 9 Allolevivirus strains) and compared them to the 11 complete genome sequences available in GenBank. Nucleotide similarities among strains of Levivirus genogroups I and II were 75% to 99% and 83 to 94%, respectively, whereas similarities among strains of Allolevivirus genogroups III and IV ranged from 70 to 96% and 75 to 95%, respectively. Although genogroup I strain fr and genogroup III strains MX1 and M11 share only 70 to 78% sequence identity with strains in their respective genogroups, phylogenetic analyses of the complete genome and the individual genes suggest that strain fr should be grouped in Levivirus genogroup I and that the MX1 and M11 strains belong in Allolevivirus genogroup III. Strains within each genus share >50% sequence identity, whereas between the two genera, strains have <40% nucleotide sequence identity. Overall, amino acid composition, nucleotide similarities, and replicase catalytic domain location contributed to phylogenetic assignments. A conserved eight-nucleotide signature at the 3' end of the genome distinguishes leviviruses (5' ACCACCCA 3') from alloleviviruses (5' TCCTCCCA 3').
