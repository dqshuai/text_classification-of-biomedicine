IL-1 family members and STAT activators induce cytokine production by Th2, Th17, and Th1 cells.

Expression of T1ST2, the IL-33R, by Th2 cells requires GATA3. Resting Th2 cells express little GATA3, which is increased by IL-33 and a STAT5 activator, in turn increasing T1ST2 from its low-level expression on resting Th2 cells. Th2 cells that have upregulated T1ST2 produce IL-13, but not IL-4, in response to IL-33 plus a STAT5 activator in an antigen-independent, NF-kappaB-dependent, cyclosporin A (CsA)-resistant manner. Similarly, Th17 cells produce IL-17A in response to IL-1beta and a STAT3 activator and Th1 cells produce IFNgamma in response to IL-18 and a STAT4 inducer. Thus, each effector Th cell produces cytokines without antigenic stimulation in response to an IL-1 family member and a specific STAT activator, implying an innate mechanism through which memory CD4 T cells are recruited by an induced cytokine environment.
