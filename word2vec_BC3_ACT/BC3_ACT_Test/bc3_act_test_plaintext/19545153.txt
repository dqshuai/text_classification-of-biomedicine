Palladium-catalyzed carboamination of alkenes promoted by N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide via C-H activation of arenes.

CF Rosewall, PA Sibbald, DV Liskin, FE Michael

This report describes a unique Pd-catalyzed oxidative carboamination of protected aminoalkenes in which inexpensive unactivated nucleophilic arenes are incorporated to give carboamination products in good yields. A variety of protected amide and carbamate groups are tolerated, and various five-, six-, and seven-membered rings are formed in good yields. Under these conditions, halobenzenes are activated at the C-H bond rather than the C-X bond, and very high regioselectivity for the para substitution product is observed in all cases. We propose that this carboamination takes place via electrophilic aromatic substitution of a Pd(IV) alkyl intermediate.
