The synthesis and photophysical evaluation of two enatiomerially pure dimetallic lanthanide luminescent triple-stranded helicates is described. The two systems, formed from the chiral (R,R) ligand 1 and (S,S) ligand 2, were produced as single species in solution, where the excitation of either the naphthalene antennae or the pyridiyl units gave rise to Eu(III) emission in a variety of solvents. Excitation of the antennae also gave rise to circularly polarized Eu(III) luminescence emissions for Eu(2):1(3) and Eu(2):2(3) that were of equal intensity and opposite sign, confirming their enantiomeric nature in solution providing a basis upon which we were able to assign the absolute configurations of Eu(2):1(3) and Eu(2):2(3).
