Genotyping of the Q locus in wheat by a simple PCR-RFLP method.

The Q locus located on the long arm of chromosome 5A is a key factor in evolution and widespread cultivation of domesticated wheat. The Q locus pleiotropically affects many agronomically important traits including threshability, glume shape and tenacity, rachis fragility and others. Genotyping of the Q locus based on the complex traits is ambiguous due to their multi-genetic control through interactions with the Q locus. To determine the Q locus genotype of wheat accessions possessing A genome, we developed a method based on polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. The Q and q alleles were clearly distinguished by PCR-RFLP analysis at six conserved single nucleotide polymorphisms in common wheat and wild and cultivated einkorn, emmer and timopheevi wheat. The Q locus genotype of Triticum sinskajae, which is one of the einkorn wheat species and exhibits free-threshing trait, was determined to be qq as expected. This simple PCR-RLFP-based genotyping method should serve as a useful tool in studying the origin of Q and thus wheat evolution after domestication and the following widespread cultivation.
