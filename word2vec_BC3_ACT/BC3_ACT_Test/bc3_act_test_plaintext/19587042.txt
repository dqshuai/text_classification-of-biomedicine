Naturally occurring hepatitis C virus (HCV) subgenomic RNAs have been found in several HCV patients. These subgenomic deletion mutants, mostly lacking the genes encoding envelope glycoproteins, were found in both liver and serum, where their relatively high abundance suggests that they are capable of autonomous replication and can be packaged and secreted in viral particles, presumably harboring the envelope proteins from wild type virus coinfecting the same cell. We recapitulated some of these natural subgenomic deletions in the context of the isolate JFH-1 and confirmed these hypotheses in vitro. In Huh-7.5 cells, these deletion-containing genomes show robust replication and can be efficiently trans-packaged and infect na√Øve Huh-7.5 cells when cotransfected with the full-length wild-type J6/JFH genome. The genome structure of these natural subgenomic deletion mutants was dissected, and the maintenance of both core and NS2 regions was proven to be significant for efficient replication and trans-packaging. To further explore the requirements needed to achieve trans-complementation, we provided different combinations of structural proteins in trans. Optimal trans-complementation was obtained when fragments of the polyprotein encompassing core to p7 or E1 to NS2 were expressed. Finally, we generated a stable helper cell line, constitutively expressing the structural proteins from core to p7, which efficiently supports trans-complementation of a subgenomic deletion encompassing amino acids 284 to 732. This cell line can produce and be infected by defective particles, thus representing a powerful tool to investigate the life cycle and relevance of natural HCV subgenomic deletion mutants in vivo.
