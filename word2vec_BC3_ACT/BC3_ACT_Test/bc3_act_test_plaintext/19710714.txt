Closing the gap between genotype and phenotype.

PK Gregersen

Making causative connections between genotypic and phenotypic variation is a major challenge for geneticists engaged in the study of human disease. A study drawing this connection for a type 1 diabetes risk locus now demonstrates the importance of focusing on specific quantitative traits and studying them in normal subjects.
