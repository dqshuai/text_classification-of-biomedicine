Gold-catalyzed [3+3]-annulation of azomethine imines with propargyl esters.

ND Shapiro, Y Shi, FD Toste

The gold-catalyzed [3+3]-cycloaddition reaction of propargyl esters and azomethine imines has been developed. The reaction provides a rapid entry into a wide range of substituted tetrahydropyridazine derivatives from simple starting materials. A stepwise mechanism involving addition of the 1,3-dipole to a gold-carbenoid intermediate is proposed.
