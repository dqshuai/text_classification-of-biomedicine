Neuron

Tyramine: a new receptor and a new role at the synapse.

R Branicky, WR Schafer

Biogenic amines are typically regarded as neuromodulators rather than fast-acting neurotransmitters. In this issue of Neuron, Pirri et al. report the characterization of LGC-55 in C. elegans, the first identified tyramine-gated chloride channel. This study suggests that the roles of classical and trace biogenic amines in all organisms may need to be reconsidered.
