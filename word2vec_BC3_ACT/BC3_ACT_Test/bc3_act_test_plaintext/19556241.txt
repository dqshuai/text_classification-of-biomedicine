A map of Drosophila melanogaster small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex (DmSNAPc) domains involved in subunit assembly and DNA binding.

Transcription of genes coding for the small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) is dependent upon a unique transcription factor known as the small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex (SNAPc). SNAPc binds to an essential proximal sequence element located about 40-65 base pairs upstream of the snRNA transcription start site. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, DmSNAPc contains three distinct polypeptides (DmSNAP190, DmSNAP50, and DmSNAP43) that are stably associated with each other and bind to the DNA as a complex. We have used mutational analysis to identify domains within each subunit that are involved in complex formation with the other two subunits in vivo. We have also identified domains in each subunit required for sequence-specific DNA binding. With one exception, domains required for subunit-subunit interactions lie in the most evolutionarily conserved regions of the proteins. However, DNA binding by DmSNAPc is dependent not only upon the conserved regions but is also highly dependent upon domains outside the conserved regions. Comparison with functional domains identified in human SNAPc indicates many parallels but also reveals significant differences in this ancient yet rapidly evolving system.
