Based on the ratios of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and caffeine (CAF) levels found in commercial tea drinks, EGCG and CAF were co-administered to human volunteers at various EGCG/CAF ratios, and plasma EGCG was determined by high performance liquid chromatography with chemiluminescence detection. As for the results, in plasma taken after ingestion of a beverage containing 95 mg of EGCG alone, the area under the plasma EGCG concentration-time curve (AUC) was 857 ngxh/ml. A higher AUC (1,370 ngxh/ml) was observed when subjects ingested a beverage containing EGCG (95 mg) and a low amount of CAF (40 mg). In the case of ingestion of a beverage containing EGCG (95 mg) and a high amount of CAF (180 mg), the AUC tended to be somewhat higher (1,165 ngxh/ml), but not significantly so, compared with the beverage with EGCG alone. These findings (modulation of plasma EGCG level by CAF) provide ideas for modulating the bioavailability of tea catechins, which can be applied to tea-related drinks and foods.
