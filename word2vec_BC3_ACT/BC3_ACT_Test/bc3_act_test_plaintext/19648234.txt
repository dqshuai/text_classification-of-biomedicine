Assembly of the tubulin-like cytoskeletal protein FtsZ into a ring structure at midcell establishes the location of the nascent division sites in prokaryotes. However, it is not yet known how the assembly and contraction of the Z ring are regulated, especially in cyanobacteria, the environmentally crucial organisms for which only one FtsZ partner protein, ZipN, has been described so far. Here, we characterized SepF and Ftn6, two novel septal proteins, in the spherical-celled strain Synechocystis PCC 6803. Both proteins were found to be indispensable to Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. The depletion of both SepF and Ftn6 resulted in delayed cytokinesis and the generation of giant cells but did not prevent FtsZ polymerization, as shown by the visualization of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged FtsZ polymers. These GFP-tagged Z-ring-like structures often appeared to be abnormal, because these reporter cells respond to the depletion of either SepF or Ftn6 with an increased abundance of total, natural, and GFP-tagged FtsZ proteins. In agreement with their septal localization, we found that both SepF and Ftn6 interact physically with FtsZ. Finally, we showed that SepF, but not Ftn6, stimulates the formation and/or stability of FtsZ polymers in vitro.
