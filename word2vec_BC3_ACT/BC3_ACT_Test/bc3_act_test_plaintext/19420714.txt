Chitinase gene expression in response to environmental stresses in Arabidopsis thaliana: chitinase inhibitor allosamidin enhances stress tolerance.

The expression levels of three chitinase genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, AtChiA (class III), AtChiB (class I), and AtChiV (class IV), were examined under various stress conditions by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Under normal growth conditions, the AtChiB and AtChiV genes were expressed in most organs of Arabidopsis plants at all growth stages, whereas the AtChiA gene was not expressed at all. The class III AtChiA gene was expressed exclusively when the plants were exposed to environmental stresses, especially to salt and wound stresses. Treatment of Arabidopsis plants with allosamidin, which inhibits class III chitinases, did not affect the growth rate. Surprisingly, however, the plants treated with allosamidin were more tolerant of abiotic stresses (cold, freezing, heat, and strong light) than the control plants. It also appeared that allosamidin enhances AtChiA and AtChiB expression under heat and strong light stresses. Allosamidin is likely to enhance abiotic stress tolerance, probably through crosstalk between the two signaling pathways for biotic and abiotic stress responses.
