C3 promotes expansion of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in a Listeria monocytogenes infection.

It is known that C3 is required for optimal expansion of T cells during acute viral infections. However, it is not yet determined whether T cell responses to intracellular bacterial infections require C3. Therefore, we have investigated the requirement for C3 to elicit potent T cell responses to Listeria monocytogenes (LM). We show that expansion of Ag-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells during a primary response to LM was markedly reduced in the absence of C3 activity. Further studies indicated that, unlike in an influenza virus infection, the regulation of LM-specific T cell responses by C3 might not involve the downstream effector C5a. Moreover, reduced T cell responses to LM was not linked to defective maturation of dendritic cells or developmental anomalies in the peripheral T cell compartment of C3-deficient mice. Experiments involving adoptive transfer of C3-deficient CD8 T cells into the C3-sufficient environment of wild-type mice showed that these T cells do not have intrinsic proliferative defects, and a paracrine source of C3 will suffice for clonal expansion of CD8 T cells in vivo. However, stimulation of purified C3-deficient CD8 T cells by plastic-immobilized anti-CD3 showed that C3 promotes T cell proliferation directly, independent of its effects on APC. On the basis of these findings, we propose that diminished T cell responses to LM in C3-deficient mice might be at least in part due to lack of direct effects of C3 on T cells. These studies have furthered our understanding of C3-mediated regulation of T cell immunity to intracellular pathogens.
