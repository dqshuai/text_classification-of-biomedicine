A Zn(II) amidinium porphyrin is the excited-state electron donor (D) to a naphthalene diimide acceptor (A) appended with either a carboxylate or sulfonate functionality. The two-point hydrogen bond (...[H(+)]...) formed between the amidinium and carboxylate or sulfonate functionalities establishes a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway for charge transfer. The two D...[H(+)]...A assemblies differ only by the proton configuration within the hydrogen-bonding interface. Specifically, the amidinium ion transfers a proton to the carboxylate to form a nonionized amidine-carboxylic acid two-point hydrogen network, whereas the amidinium retains both protons when bound to the sulfonate functionality, forming an ionized amidinium-sulfonate two-point hydrogen bond network. These two interface configurations within the dyads thus allow for a direct comparison of the PCET kinetics for the same donor and acceptor juxtaposed by ionized and nonionized hydrogen-bonded interfaces. Analysis of the PCET kinetics ascertained from transient absorption and transient emission spectroscopy reveals that the ionized interface is more strongly impacted by the local solvent environment, thus establishing that the initial static configuration of the proton interface is a critical determinant in the kinetics of PCET.
