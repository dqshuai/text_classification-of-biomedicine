Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are important in plant gene expression. Here we show that the expression of rice HDAC genes is both tissue/organ-specific, and most of them are responsive to drought or salt stresses. Over-expression of several rice HDACs did not produce any visible phenotype, whereas down-regulation of a few HDAC genes affected different developmental aspects. Specifically, down-regulation of HDA703 by amiRNA reduced rice peduncle elongation and fertility, while inactivation of a closely related homolog HDA710 by RNAi affected vegetative growth. HDA704 RNAi altered plant height and flag leaf morphology. Down-regulation of HDT702 led to the production of narrowed leaves and stems. These data suggest that rice HDAC genes may have divergent developmental functions compared with closely related homologs in Arabidopsis.
