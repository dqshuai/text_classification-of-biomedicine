Pyrin critical to macrophage IL-1beta response to Francisella challenge.

Relative to monocytes, human macrophages are deficient in their ability to process and release IL-1beta. In an effort to explain this difference, we used a model of IL-1beta processing and release that is dependent upon bacterial escape into the cytosol. Fresh human blood monocytes were compared with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) for their IL-1beta release in response to challenge with Francisella novicida. Although both cell types produced similar levels of IL-1beta mRNA and intracellular pro-IL-1beta, only monocytes readily released processed mature IL-1beta. Baseline mRNA expression profiling of candidate genes revealed a remarkable deficiency in the pyrin gene, MEFV, expression in MDM compared with monocytes. Immunoblots confirmed a corresponding deficit in MDM pyrin protein. To determine whether pyrin levels were responsible for the monocyte/MDM difference in mature IL-1beta release, pyrin expression was knocked down by nucleofecting small interfering RNA against pyrin into monocytes or stably transducing small interfering RNA against pyrin into the monocyte cell line, THP-1. Pyrin knockdown was associated with a significant drop in IL-1beta release in both cell types. Importantly, M-CSF treatment of MDM restored pyrin levels and IL-1beta release. Similarly, the stable expression of pyrin in PMA-stimulated THP-1-derived macrophages induces caspase-1 activation, associated with increased IL-1beta release after infection with F. novicida. In summary, intracellular pyrin levels positively regulate MDM IL-1beta responsiveness to Francisella challenge.
