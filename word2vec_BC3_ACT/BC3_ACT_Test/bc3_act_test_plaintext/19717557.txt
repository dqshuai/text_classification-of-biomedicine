The Tec family kinase Itk exists as a folded monomer in vivo.

Q Qi, A August

Tec family tyrosine kinases transduce signals from antigen and other receptors. In particular, Itk plays an important role in T-cell development and activation. Itk has an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, a Tec Homology domain with a proline-rich region, SH3 and SH2 domains and a kinase domain, the structure each of which has been determined. However, the full structure of Itk and other Tec kinases remain elusive. Models of Itk suggest either a head to tail dimer, with the SH2 domain interacting with the SH3 domain, or a folded monomer with the SH3 domain interacting with the proline-rich region. We show here that in vivo Itk exists as a monomer, with the pleckstrin homology domain less than 80 A from the C terminus. Zn2+ coordinating residues in the Tec Homology domain, not the proline-rich region, are critical for this intramolecular interaction. These data have implications for our understanding of Tec family kinase structure.
