Suppression of cytochrome P450 1A1 expression induced by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in mouse hepatoma hepa-1c1c7 cells treated with serum of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate- and green tea extract-administered rats.

The suppression of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) expression was examined in mouse hepatoma Hepa-1c1c7 cells treated with serum prepared from (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate- and green tea extract-administered rats. Catechins were found in the rat plasma after the administration. In Hepa-1c1c7 cells, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced CYP1A1 expression was suppressed by treatment with the rat serum. It is concluded that catechins can possibly modulate CYP1A1 expression.
