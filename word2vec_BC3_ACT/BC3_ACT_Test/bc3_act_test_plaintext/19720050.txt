Cerebral ischemia is accompanied by fulminant cellular and humoral inflammatory changes in the brain which contribute to lesion development after stroke. A tight interplay between the brain and the peripheral immune system leads to a biphasic immune response to stroke consisting of an early activation of peripheral immune cells with massive production of proinflammatory cytokines followed by a systemic immunosuppression within days of cerebral ischemia that is characterized by massive immune cell loss in spleen and thymus. Recent work has documented the importance of T lymphocytes in the early exacerbation of ischemic injury. The lipid signaling mediator sphingosine 1-phosphate-derived stable analog FTY720 (fingolimod) acts as an immunosuppressant and induces lymphopenia by preventing the egress of lymphocytes, especially T cells, from lymph nodes. We found that treatment with FTY720 (1mg/kg) reduced lesion size and improved neurological function after experimental stroke in mice, decreased the numbers of infiltrating neutrophils, activated microglia/macrophages in the ischemic lesion and reduced immunohistochemical features of apoptotic cell death in the lesion.
