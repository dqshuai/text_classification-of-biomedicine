Endothelial inflammation is regulated by a complex molecular mechanism. TC1(C8orf4) is a novel regulator implicated in cancer and inflammation. It is a small protein conserved well among vertebrates. In zebrafish embryos, it is mostly expressed in angio-hematopoietic system and the overexpression induces edema. In human aortic endothelial cells and umbilical vein endothelial cells, TC1 transfection up-regulates key inflammatory cytokines, enzymes, and adhesion proteins including IL-6, IL-1alpha, COX-2, CXCL1, CCL5, CCL2, IL-8, ICAM1, VCAM1, and E-selectin, while TC1 knockdown down-regulates them. TC1 also enhances inflammatory parameters such as monocyte-endothelial adhesion and endothelial monolayer permeability. TC1 is up-regulated by IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, LPS, and phorbol ester, and the up-regulation is inhibited by I-kappaB-kinase inhibitors. TC1, in turn, enhances the nuclear translocation of RelA and the DNA binding activity, suggesting a biological role of amplifying NF-kappaB signaling via a positive feedback. Our findings suggest that TC1 is a novel endothelial inflammatory regulator that might be implicated in inflammatory vascular diseases.
