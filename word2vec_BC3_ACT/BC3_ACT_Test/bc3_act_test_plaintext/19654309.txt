We have found previously that acquired doxorubicin resistance in a genetically engineered mouse model for BRCA1-related breast cancer was associated with increased expression of the mouse multidrug resistance (Mdr1) genes, which encode the drug efflux transporter ATP-binding cassette B1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Here, we show that even moderate increases of Mdr1 expression (as low as 5-fold) are sufficient to cause doxorubicin resistance. These moderately elevated tumor P-gp levels are below those found in some normal tissues, such as the gut. The resistant phenotype could be completely reversed by the third-generation P-gp inhibitor tariquidar, which provides a useful strategy to circumvent this type of acquired doxorubicin resistance. The presence of MDR1A in drug-resistant tumors with a moderate increase in Mdr1a transcripts could be shown with a newly generated chicken antibody against a mouse P-gp peptide. Our data show the usefulness of realistic preclinical models to characterize levels of Mdr1 gene expression that are sufficient to cause resistance.
