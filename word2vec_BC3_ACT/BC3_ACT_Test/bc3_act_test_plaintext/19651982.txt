A terminator of floral stem cells.

F Ming, H Ma

Normal flower development requires the termination of stem cell activities in the floral meristem. The floral regulator AGAMOUS (AG) is necessary for this termination and represses the expression of the stem cell determinant WUSCHEL (WUS), but the repression mechanism was not clear. A recent study by Sun and colleagues (pp. 1791-1804) in this issue of Genes & Development has identified a direct target of AG, KNUCKLES (KNU), which encodes a transcriptional repressor of WUS, providing a key missing link in floral meristem determinacy.
