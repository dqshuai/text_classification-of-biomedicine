Room-temperature hydrogen generation from hydrous hydrazine for chemical hydrogen storage.

SK Singh, XB Zhang, Q Xu

Rhodium nanoparticles (NPs) effectively catalyze the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine to produce hydrogen under ambient reaction conditions. Rh(0) NPs with a particle size of approximately 5 nm prepared in the presence of hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide show higher catalytic activity.
