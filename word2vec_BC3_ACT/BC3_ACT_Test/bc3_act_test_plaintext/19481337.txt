Genetic variations in DNA repair genes are thought to modify DNA repair capacity and suggested to be related to cancer risk. However, epidemiological results have been inconsistent. In this meta-analysis, we assessed reported studies of association between polymorphisms of X-ray repair cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1) codon 399 and 194, and lung cancer risk. We found decreased lung cancer risk among subjects carrying XRCC1 codon 194 Arg/Trp genotype [odds ratio (OR)=0.88, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.79-0.97], using 4848 cases and 6592 controls from 16 studies. There was no association between lung cancer risk and XRCC1 codon 399 polymorphism in total population, when stratified by source of control, we found a protective effect of the XRCC1 codon 399 Gln/Gln and Arg/Gln or Gln/Gln polymorphisms for lung cancer on the basis of population control (OR=0.73, 95% CI: 0.58-0.92; OR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.77-0.97, respectively). Data indicated that certain XRCC1 codon 399 and 194 variant may affect the susceptibility of lung cancer. Recommendations for further studies include pooling of individual data to facilitate evaluation of multigenic effects and detailed analysis of effect modification by environmental exposure.
