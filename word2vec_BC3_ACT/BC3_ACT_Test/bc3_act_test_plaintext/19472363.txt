Acidianus Filamentous Virus 1 (AFV1), isolated from acidic hot springs, is an enveloped lipid-containing archaeal filamentous virus with a linear double-stranded DNA genome. It infects Acidianus, which is a hyperthermostable archaea growing at 85 degrees C and acidic pHs, below pH 3. AFV1-99, a protein of 99 amino acids of unknown function, has homologues in the archaeal virus families Lipothrixviridae and Rudiviridae. We determined the crystal structure of AFV1-99 at 2.05 A resolution. AFV1-99 has a new fold, is hyperthermostable (up to 95 degrees C) and resists to extreme pH (between pH 0 and 11) and to the combination of high temperature (95 degrees C) and low pH (pH 0). It possesses characteristics of hyperthermostable proteins, such as a high content of charged residues.
