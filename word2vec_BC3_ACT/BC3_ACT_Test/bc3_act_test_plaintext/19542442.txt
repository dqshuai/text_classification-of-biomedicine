Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent APCs for activating naive T cells, a process facilitated by the ability of immature DCs to mature and home to lymph nodes after encountering an inflammatory stimulus. Proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement play an important role in regulating the adherence and motility of DCs. Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho family GTPases, mediates cytoskeletal rearrangement in hematopoietic cells following integrin ligation. We show that Vav1 is not required for the normal maturation of DCs in vitro; however, it is critical for DC binding to fibronectin and regulates the distribution but not the formation of podosomes. We also found that DC Vav1 was an important component of a signaling pathway involving focal adhesion kinase, phospholipase C-gamma2, and ERK1/2 following integrin ligation. Surprisingly, Vav1(-/-) DCs had increased rates of migration in vivo compared with wild-type control DCs. In vitro findings show that the presence of adhesive substrates such as fibronectin resulted in inhibition of migration. However, there was less inhibition in the absence of Vav1. These findings suggest that DC migration is negatively regulated by adhesion and integrin-mediated signaling and that Vav1 has a central role in this process.
