SHIP1 inhibits immune receptor signaling through hydrolysis of the PI3K product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, forming phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate. In mast cells, SHIP1 represses FcepsilonRI- and cytokine-mediated activation in vitro, but little is known regarding the function of SHIP1 in mast cells in vivo or the susceptibility of Ship1(-/-) mice to mast cell-associated diseases. In this study, we found that Ship1(-/-) mice have systemic mast cell hyperplasia, increased serum levels of IL-6, TNF, and IL-5, and heightened anaphylactic response. Further, by reconstituting mast cell-deficient mice with Ship1(+/+) or Ship1(-/-) mast cells, we found that the above defects were due to loss of SHIP1 in mast cells. Additionally, we found that mice reconstituted with Ship1(-/-) mast cells suffered worse allergic asthma pathology than those reconstituted with Ship1(+/+) mast cells. In summary, our data show that SHIP1 represses allergic inflammation and mast cell hyperplasia in vivo and exerts these effects specifically in mast cells.
