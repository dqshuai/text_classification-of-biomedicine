When bis(substituted cyclopentadienyl)- or bis(indenyl)zirconacyclopentadienes were treated with TiCl(4), a coupling reaction between the substituted cyclopentadienyl or indenyl ligand and the diene moiety proceeded to give indene or fluorene derivatives in moderate to high yields. With the sterically hindered t-Bu-substituted Cp ligand, the coupling products were obtained in high yields.
