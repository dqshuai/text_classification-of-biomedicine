Identification of residues in the drug translocation pathway of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein by arginine mutagenesis.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ATP-binding cassette B1) is a drug pump that extracts toxic drug substrates from the plasma membrane and catalyzes their ATP-dependent efflux. To map the residues in the drug translocation pathway, we performed arginine-scanning mutagenesis on all transmembrane (TM) segments (total = 237 residues) of a P-gp processing mutant (G251V) defective in folding (15% maturation efficiency) (glycosylation state used to monitor folding). The rationale was that arginines introduced into the drug-binding sites would mimic drug rescue and enhance maturation of wild-type or processing mutants of P-gp. It was found that 38 of the 89 mutants that matured had enhanced maturation. Enhancer mutations were found in 11 of the 12 TM segments with the largest number found in TMs 6 and 12 (seven in each), TMs that are critical for P-gp-drug substrate interactions. Modeling of the TM segments showed that the enhancer arginines were found on the hydrophilic face, whereas inhibitory arginines were located on a hydrophobic face that may be in contact with the lipid bilayer. It was found that many of the enhancer arginines caused large alterations in P-gp-drug interactions in ATPase assays. For example, mutants A302R (TM5), L339R (TM6), G872R (TM10), F942R (TM11), Q946R (TM11), V982R (TM12), and S993R (TM12) reduced the apparent affinity for verapamil by approximately 10-fold, whereas the F336R (TM6) and M986R (TM12) mutations caused at least a 10-fold increase in apparent affinity for rhodamine B. The results suggest that P-gp contains a large aqueous-filled drug translocation pathway with multiple drug-binding sites that can accommodate the bulky arginine side chains to promote folding of the protein.
