Characterizing the initial encounter complex in cadherin adhesion.

S Sivasankar, Y Zhang, WJ Nelson, S Chu

Cadherins are Ca(2+)-dependent cell-cell adhesion proteins with an extracellular region of five domains (EC1 to EC5). Adhesion is mediated by "strand swapping" of a conserved tryptophan residue in position 2 between EC1 domains of opposing cadherins, but the formation of this structure is not well understood. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and single-molecule force measurements with the atomic force microscope, we demonstrate that cadherins initially interact via EC1 domains without swapping tryptophan-2 to form a weak Ca(2+) dependent initial encounter complex that has 25% of the bond strength of a strand-swapped dimer. We suggest that cadherin dimerization proceeds via an induced fit mechanism where the monomers first form a tryptophan-2 independent initial encounter complex and then undergo subsequent conformational changes to form the final strand-swapped dimer.
