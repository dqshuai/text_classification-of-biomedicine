Myosin II recruitment during cytokinesis independent of centralspindlin-mediated phosphorylation.

JR Beach, TT Egelhoff

During cell division, the mechanisms by which myosin II is recruited to the contractile ring are not fully understood. Much recent work has focused on a model in which spatially restricted de novo filament assembly occurs at the cell equator via localized myosin II regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation, stimulated by the RhoA-activating centralspindlin complex. Here, we show that a recombinant myosin IIA protein that assembles constitutively and is incapable of binding RLC still displays strong localization to the furrow in mammalian cells. Furthermore, this RLC-deficient myosin II efficiently drives cytokinesis, demonstrating that centralspindlin-based RLC phosphorylation is not necessary for myosin II localization during furrowing. Myosin II truncation analysis further reveals two distinct myosin II tail properties that contribute to furrow localization: a central tail domain mediating cortical furrow binding to heterologous binding partners and a carboxyl-terminal region mediating co-assembly with existing furrow myosin IIA or IIB filaments.
