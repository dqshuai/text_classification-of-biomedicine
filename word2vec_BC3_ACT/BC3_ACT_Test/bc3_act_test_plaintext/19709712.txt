Little is known about the influences of other porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) proteins on the immunogenicity of Cap protein. Here we constructed plasmids expressing the ORF1 (pORF1) and ORF3 (pORF3) of PCV2, and mixed either of them with the plasmid expressing ORF2 (pORF2) as combined DNA vaccines, to compare their immunogenicity and protective efficacy. Our data revealed that pORF1 reduced the Cap-specific CD8(+)cell frequency, and both pORF1 and pORF3 attenuated the Cap-specific Th1 and post-challenge-recall VN antibody responses induced by the pORF2 plasmid, despite successful induction of Rep and ORF3 antibodies by pORF1 and pORF3, respectively. Subsequently, protocols with pORF1 or pORF3 showed significantly decreased protective efficacy compared to pORF2 alone. Overall, our data suggested that the ORF1- and ORF3-encoded Rep and ORF3 proteins may interfere with the cellular, humoral and protective immunity of the ORF2-encoded Cap protein in vivo.
