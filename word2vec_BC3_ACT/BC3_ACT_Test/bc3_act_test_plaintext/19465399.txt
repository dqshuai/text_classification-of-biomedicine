Base extrusion is found at helical junctions between right- and left-handed forms of DNA and RNA.

Base extrusion is a major structural feature at the junction between B- and Z-DNA (the B-Z junction) where a base pair is broken, and the two bases are extruded from the double helix. Despite the demonstration of base extrusion at the B-Z junction, it is not clear whether a similar base extrusion occurs at other types of junctions involving the left-handed Z conformation. Here, we investigate structural changes of bases at three Z-form junctions: DNA B-Z and Z-Z and RNA A-Z junctions. By monitoring fluorescently labeled duplex nucleic acids using 2-aminopurines at various positions relative to the junction point, we show that base extrusion occurs not only at the DNA B-Z junction, but also at the RNA A-Z and DNA Z-Z junctions. Our data suggest that base extrusion is a general feature of Z-form nucleic-acid junctions.
