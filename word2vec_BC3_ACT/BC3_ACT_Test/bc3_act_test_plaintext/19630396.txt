Mg metal reduction of the divalent precursor PdCl(2)(CNAr(Dipp2))(2) (Dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl) provides the isolable, two-coordinate Pd(0) bis-isocyanide, Pd(CNAr(Dipp2))(2), which is the first stable monomeric isocyanide complex of zerovalent palladium. Variable temperature (1)H NMR and FTIR studies on Pd(CNAr(Dipp2))(2) in the presence of added CNAr(Dipp2) revealed that free and coordinated isocyanide undergo rapid exchange, but the components do not form a stable tris-isocyanide complex. Bis-isocyanide Pd(CNAr(Dipp2))(2) is active for oxidative addition reactions and readily reacts with benzyl chloride and mesityl bromide to form Pd(Cl)(Bz)(CNAr(Dipp2))(2) and Pd(Br)(Mes)(CNAr(Dipp2))(2), respectively. Room-temperature Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions are mediated by Pd(CNAr(Dipp2))(2). Coordinatively and electronically unsaturated substrates also react with Pd(CNAr(Dipp2))(2). Addition of thallium(I) triflate (TlOTf) to Pd(CNAr(Dipp2))(2) results in the salt [TlPd(CNAr(Dipp2))(2)]OTf, while addition of O(2) results in the peroxo complex (eta(2)-O)Pd(CNAr(Dipp2))(2). Most remarkably, 2 equiv of nitrosobenzene react with Pd(CNAr(Dipp2))(2) to form the square planar complex (kappa(1)-N-PhNO)(2) Pd(CNAr(Dipp2))(2), the geometry of which strongly suggests the formation of a divalent Pd center. With the aid of density functional theory calculations, this valence change is rationalized in terms of a formal reduction of the bond order in each NO unit to 1.5.
