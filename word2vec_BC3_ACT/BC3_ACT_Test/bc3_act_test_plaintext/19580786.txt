Human dental pulp-derived stem cells (hDPSCs) have been considered alternative sources of adult stem cells because of their potential to differentiate into multiple cell lineages. This study investigated the possible role of gangliosides in the neural differentiation of hDPSCs. When hDPSCs were cultured under neural differentiation conditions, expression of neural cell marker genes such as Nestin, MAP-2, and NeuN was detected. Immunostaining and high-performance thin-layer chromatography analysis showed that an increase in ganglioside biosynthesis was associated with neural differentiation of hDPSCs. Specifically, a significant increase in GD3 and GD1a expression was observed during neural differentiation. To confirm the role of gangliosides in neural differentiation, ganglioside biosynthesis was inhibited in hDPSCs by knockdown of UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (Ugcg), which prevented differentiation into neural cells. These results suggest that gangliosides may play a role in the neural differentiation process of hDPSCs.
