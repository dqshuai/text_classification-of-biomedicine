This study investigated the potential of RNA interference, which is technically challenging in bivalve mollusc species, to assess gene function in the oyster Crassostrea gigas. We designed dsRNA targeting the oyster vasa-like gene (Oyvlg), specifically expressed in oyster germ cells. In vivo injection of oyvl-dsRNA into the gonad provokes a knockdown phenotype corresponding to germ cell underproliferation and prematurely arrested meiosis througout the organ. The most severe phenotype observed is sterile. This knockdown phenotype is associated with a decrease in Oyvlg mRNA level of between 39% and 87%, and a strong reduction in OYVLG protein, to an undetectable level. Therefore, Oyvlg appears to be essential for germ cell development in Crassostrea gigas, particularly for mitotic proliferation and early meiosis. Our results demonstrate for the first time that in vivo RNA interference works efficiently in a bivalve species, opening major perspectives for functional genetic studies.
