Nondividing but metabolically active gamma-irradiated Brucella melitensis is protective against virulent B. melitensis challenge in mice.

Brucella spp. are gram-negative bacteria that cause the most frequent zoonotic disease worldwide, with more than 500,000 human infections yearly; however, no human vaccine is currently available. As with other intracellular organisms, cytotoxic mechanisms against infected cells are thought to have an important role in controlling infection and mediating long-term immunity. Live attenuated strains developed for use in animals elicit protection but retain unacceptable levels of virulence. Thus, the optimal design for a brucellosis vaccine requires a nonliving vaccine that confers effective immunity. Historically, inactivation methods such as chemical or heat treatment successfully impair Brucella reproductive capacity; nevertheless, metabolically inactive vaccines (subunit or killed) present very limited efficacy. Hence, we hypothesized that bacterial metabolism plays a major role in creating the proper antigenic and adjuvant properties required for efficient triggering of protective responses. Here, we demonstrate that inactivation of Brucella melitensis by gamma-irradiation inhibited its replication capability and yet retained live-Brucella protective features. Irradiated Brucella possessed metabolic and transcriptional activity, persisted in macrophages, generated antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, and protected mice against virulent bacterial challenge, without signs of residual virulence. In conclusion, pathogen metabolic activity has a positive role in shaping protective responses, and the generation of inactivated and yet metabolically active microbes is a promising strategy for safely vaccinating against intracellular organisms such as B. melitensis.
