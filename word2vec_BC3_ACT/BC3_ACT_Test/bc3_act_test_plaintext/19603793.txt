CdSe quantum dot sensitized solar cells. Shuttling electrons through stacked carbon nanocups.

B Farrow, PV Kamat

The charge separation between excited CdSe semiconductor quantum dots and stacked-cup carbon nanotubes (SCCNTs) has been successfully tapped to generate photocurrent in a quantum dot sensitized solar cell (QDSC). By employing an electrophoretic deposition technique we have cast SCCNT-CdSe composite films on optically transparent electrodes (OTEs). The quenching of CdSe emission, as well as transient absorption measurements, confirms ultrafast electron transfer to SCCNTs. The rate constant for electron transfer increases from 9.51 x 10(9) s(-1) to 7.04 x 10(10) s(-1) as we decrease the size of CdSe nanoparticles from 4.5 to 3 nm. The ability of SCCNTs to collect and transport electrons from excited CdSe has been established from photocurrent measurements. The morphological and excited state properties of SCCNT-CdSe composites demonstrate their usefulness in energy conversion devices.
