It has been suggested that vasculogenesis by endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) as well as angiogenesis play an important role in the production of blood vessels in neoplasm. The present study was designed to isolate and characterize the EPC in gastric cancer patients as a tumor specific angiogenesis marker. The cells derived from CD34 positive PBMC presented with a cobblestone appearance at 28 days, revealing differentiation into endothelial cells. They were also positive to the LDL-uptake reaction, showing that they have biological endothelial cell functions. These cells demonstrated tube formation, showing their ability to participate in neovascularization. The cells derived from CD34 positive PBMC expressed CD133 and demonstrated telomerase activity, showing the stem cell character. In xenograft model, EPC derived from CD34 positive PBMC mobilized mainly into tumor area after being injected through tail vein. With isolation, ex vivo amplification and characterization of EPC from gastric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, endothelial progenitor cells may be used as a candidate prognostic and predictive biomarker for cancer.
