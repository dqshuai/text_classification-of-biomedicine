Blood-brain barrier disruption and brain edema are detrimental in ischemic stroke. The kallikrein-kinin system appears to play an important role in the regulation of vascular permeability and is invoked in edema formation. The effects of kinins are mediated by bradykinin receptors B1R and B2R. However, little is known about the exact roles of bradykinin receptors in the early stage of cerebral ischemia. In this study, we demonstrated that ischemia upregulated the level of B1R and B2R at 24h after reperfusion by immunofluorescence assays, mainly expressed in astrocytes and neurons, respectively, in the ischemic penumbra. Moreover, B2R inhibition more effectively reduced neurological severity scores, blood-brain barrier permeability and cytokines release than B1R inhibition did. Additionally, B2R inhibition also significantly suppressed B1R protein level. Therefore, blockade of B2R may be a more effective strategy for the treatment of ischemic brain injury than B1R inhibition within 24h after reperfusion.
