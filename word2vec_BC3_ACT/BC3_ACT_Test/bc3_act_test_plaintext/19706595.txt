NET37, a nuclear envelope transmembrane protein with glycosidase homology, is involved in myoblast differentiation.

The nuclear lamina and its associated proteins are important for nuclear structure and chromatin organization and also have been implicated in the regulation of cell signaling and gene expression. In this study we demonstrate that the lamina-associated nuclear envelope transmembrane protein NET37 is required for myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. NET37, a member of glycosidase family 31, is highly expressed in mouse skeletal muscle and is strongly up-regulated during C2C12 differentiation. By protease mapping we show that its glycosidase homology domain is located in the lumen of the nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum. When NET37 is depleted from proliferating myoblasts by RNAi, myogenic differentiation is significantly impaired, and there is a concomitant delay in up-regulation of the late myogenic transcription factor myogenin. We expressed silencing-resistant NET37 mutated at a conserved residue in the glycosidase domain and found that this predicted catalytically inactive protein is unable to support myogenesis in cells depleted of wild type NET37. Therefore, the enzymatic function of NET37 appears to be important for myogenic differentiation. C2C12 cells depleted of NET37 have reduced activation of Akt after shifting to differentiation medium and are defective in insulin like growth factor-II (IGF-II) secretion, an autocrine/paracrine factor involved in Akt activation. We also observed that pro-IGF-II co-immunoprecipitates with NET37. Based on our results, we propose that NET37 has a role in IGF-II maturation in the secretory pathway during myoblast differentiation. The localization of NET37 at the nuclear envelope raises the possibility that it may coordinate myogenic events between the nuclear interior and the endoplasmic reticulum lumen via transmembrane communication.
