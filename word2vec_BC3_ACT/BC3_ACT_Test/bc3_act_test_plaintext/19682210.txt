Penelope's web: using alpha-latrotoxin to untangle the mysteries of exocytosis.

JP Silva, J Suckling, Y Ushkaryov

For more than three decades, the venom of the black widow spider and its principal active components, latrotoxins, have been used to induce release of neurotransmitters and hormones and to study the mechanisms of exocytosis. Given the complex nature of alpha--latrotoxin (alpha-LTX) actions, this research has been continuously overshadowed by many enigmas, misconceptions and perpetual changes of the underlying hypotheses. Some of the toxin's mechanisms of action are still not completely understood. Despite all these difficulties, the extensive work of several generations of neurobiologists has brought about a great deal of fascinating insights into pre-synaptic processes and has led to the discovery of several novel proteins and synaptic systems. For example, alpha-LTX studies have contributed to the widespread acceptance of the vesicular theory of transmitter release. Pre-synaptic receptors for alpha-LTX--neurexins, latrophilins and protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma--and their endogenous ligands have now become centrepieces of their own areas of research, with a potential of uncovering new mechanisms of synapse formation and regulation that may have medical implications. However, any future success of alpha-LTX research will require a better understanding of this unusual natural tool and a more precise dissection of its multiple mechanisms.
