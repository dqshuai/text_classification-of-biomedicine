Inhibitors of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone are showing considerable promise as potential molecular therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. Here we describe novel 2-aminothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine ATP competitive Hsp90 inhibitors, which were designed by combining structural elements of distinct low affinity hits generated from fragment-based and in silico screening exercises in concert with structural information from X-ray protein crystallography. Examples from this series have high affinity (IC50 = 50-100 nM) for Hsp90 as measured in a fluorescence polarization (FP) competitive binding assay and are active in human cancer cell lines where they inhibit cell proliferation and exhibit a characteristic profile of depletion of oncogenic proteins and concomitant elevation of Hsp72. Several examples (34a, 34d and 34i) caused tumor growth regression at well tolerated doses when administered orally in a human BT474 human breast cancer xenograft model.
