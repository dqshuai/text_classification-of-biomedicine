To further investigate the effect of a combination of genistein with survivin of RNA interference on the proliferation and apoptosis of DU-145 cells, the effect of genistein on the proliferation of DU-145 cells was detected by the MTT method and cytometry, and the apoptosis of cells was observed with fluorescence microscopy. In order to test combined genistein with transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against survivin, a survivin siRNA plasmid was constructed and transfected into DU-145 cells. Genistein inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of cancerous DU-145 and Hela cells, whereas genistein had minimal effects for normal L-O2 cells. The stable transfected cell lines of DU-145, knockdown survivin by siRNA, displayed stronger apoptotic than untransfected DU-145, the transfected cell of DU-145 treated with genistein demonstrated the inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis significantly; it showed genistein synergistic effect with RNAi in survivin for inhibition of prostate cancer cells.
