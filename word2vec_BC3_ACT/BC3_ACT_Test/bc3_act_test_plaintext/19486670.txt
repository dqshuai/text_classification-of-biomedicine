Microscopic mechanism for experimentally observed anomalous elasticity of DNA in two dimensions.

N Destainville, M Manghi, J Palmeri

By exploring a recent model in which DNA bending elasticity, described by the wormlike chain model, is coupled to basepair denaturation, we demonstrate that small denaturation bubbles lead to anomalies in the flexibility of DNA at the nanometric scale, when confined in two dimensions (2D), as reported in atomic-force microscopy experiments. Our model yields very good fits to experimental data and quantitative predictions that can be tested experimentally. Although such anomalies exist when DNA fluctuates freely in three dimensions (3D), they are too weak to be detected. Interactions between bases in the helical double-stranded DNA are modified by electrostatic adsorption on a 2D substrate, which facilitates local denaturation. This work reconciles the apparent discrepancy between observed 2D and 3D DNA elastic properties and points out that conclusions about the 3D properties of DNA (and its companion proteins and enzymes) do not directly follow from 2D experiments by atomic-force microscopy.
