Positively charged base surrogate for highly stable "base pairing" through electrostatic and stacking interactions.

"Base pairs" of cationic dyes (p-methylstilbazole) were incorporated into oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs). This "base pair" greatly stabilized the duplex through electrostatic and stacking interactions. The melting temperature of modified ODN was higher than those of neutral dyes and native base pairs. Further stabilization of the duplex was observed when the number of cationic dyes increased.
