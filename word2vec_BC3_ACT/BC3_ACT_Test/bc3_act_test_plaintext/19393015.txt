Mitochondrial glutathione uptake: characterization in isolated brain mitochondria and astrocytes in culture.

Glutathione in the mitochondria is an important determinant of cellular responses to oxidative stress. Mitochondrial glutathione is maintained by uptake from the cytosol, a process that has been little studied in brain cells. In the present study, measurements using isolated rat brain mitochondria showed a rapid uptake of [3H]-glutathione that was strongly influenced by the mitochondrial glutathione content. [3H]-glutathione incorporated into the mitochondria was not rapidly released. Uptake was inhibited by substrates and inhibitors for several known mitochondrial anion transporters. Citrate, isocitrate and benzene-1,2,3-tricarboxylate were particularly effective inhibitors, suggesting a possible role for a tricarboxylate carrier in the glutathione transport. The properties of uptake differed greatly from those reported previously for mitochondria from kidney and liver. In astrocytes in primary culture, diethylmaleate or hydrogen peroxide treatment resulted in depletion of cytosolic and mitochondrial glutathione. The pattern of restoration of glutathione content in the presence of glutathione precursors following treatment with diethylmaleate was consistent with uptake into mitochondria being controlled primarily by the glutathione gradient between the cytosol and mitochondria. However, following hydrogen peroxide treatment, recovery of glutathione in the mitochondria initially preceded comparable proportional restoration in the cytosol, suggesting the possibility of additional controls on glutathione uptake in some conditions.
