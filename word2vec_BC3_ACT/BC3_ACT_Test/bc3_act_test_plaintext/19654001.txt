Forces-induced pinpoint denaturation of short DNA.

BY Pan, L Zhang, SX Dou, PY Wang

A method that can pinpoint control DNA denaturation is reported. In the single molecule experiment using spFRET, DNA adhered on a quartz surface is acted upon by both a weak laser field force and a fast temporal mechanical force. The experiment showed that increasing strengths of laser power result in increasing percentage of denatured DNA; different mechanical forces produce different numbers of DNA opening. Besides the method's simplicity and convenience for DNA melting, its crucial advantage and potential application is the ability to denature DNA at specified locations, i.e., a weak laser and a fast temporal mechanical force can be used in pinpoint denaturation of short DNA.
