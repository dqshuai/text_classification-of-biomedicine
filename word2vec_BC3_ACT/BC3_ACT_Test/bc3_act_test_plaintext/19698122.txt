BACKGROUND: Thrombospondin1 (THBS1), cystene-rich protein 61 (Cyr61) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) are all involved in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signal pathway, which plays an important role in the tumorigenesis. The purpose of this study is to explore the expression and prognostic significance of these proteins in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry and western blotting to examine the expression status of THBS1, Cyr61 and CTGF in ESCC. Correlations of THBS1, Cyr61 and CTGF over-expressions with various clinicopathologic factors were also determined by using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact probability test. Survival analysis was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. Relative risk was evaluated by the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: THBS1, Cyr61 and CTGF were all over-expressed in ESCC. THBS1 over-expression was significantly associated with TNM stage (P = 0.029) and regional lymph node involvement (P = 0.026). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that over-expression of THBS1, Cyr61 or CTGF was related to poor survival of ESCC patients (P = 0.042, P = 0.020, P = 0.018, respectively). Multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that Cyr61 and CTGF were independent factors in prognosis of ESCC. CONCLUSION: Cyr61, CTGF and THBS1 were all over-expressed in ESCC and might be new molecular markers to predict the prognosis of ESCC patients.
