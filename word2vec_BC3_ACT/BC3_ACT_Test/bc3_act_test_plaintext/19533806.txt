CD74 in antigen presentation, inflammation, and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract.

EJ Beswick, VE Reyes

CD74 is a protein whose initial role in antigen presentation was recognized two decades ago. Recent studies have revealed that it has additional functions as a receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor and as a receptor for an important human pathogen, Helicobacter pylori (H pylori). The role of CD74 as a receptor is important because after binding of migration inhibitory factor or H pylori, NF-kappaB and Erk1/2 activation occurs, along with the induction of proinflammatory cytokine secretion. This review provides an up-to-date account of the functions of CD74 and how it might be involved in inflammation and cancer within the gastrointestinal tract.
