Neuron

Amyloid + activation = Alzheimer's?

W Jagust

PET imaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients demonstrates Abeta-protein accumulation in a default mode network. In this issue of Neuron, Sperling and colleagues show that cognitively intact individuals with Abeta in this network fail to deactivate it during memory tasks, a finding with important implications for cognitive aging and early detection of AD.
