We have cloned the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-like protein (Anisakis simplex (As)-MIF) from larvae of the whale worm (Anisakis simplex third-stage larvae). Asthma was induced in the mice using OVA/alum, with or without various concentrations of rAs-MIF treatment before OVA/alum challenge. Treatment with rAs-MIF coupled with OVA/alum during the challenge period induced a complete inhibition of eosinophilia and goblet cell hyperplasia within the lung and profoundly ameliorated the development of lung hyperreactivity. Also, rAs-MIF was shown to reduce profoundly the quantity of Th2-related cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid and allergen-specific IgG2a in sera. IL-10 and TGF-beta levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the rAs-MIF-treated group were significantly higher than in the other groups. Additionally, CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells (regulatory T) were recruited to the spleen and lungs of the rAs-MIF-treated mice, but this recruitment was inhibited by anti-rAs-MIF Ab.
