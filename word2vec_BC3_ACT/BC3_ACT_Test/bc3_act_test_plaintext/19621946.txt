A 2-aminobenzimidazole that inhibits and disperses gram-positive biofilms through a zinc-dependent mechanism.

SA Rogers, RW Huigens, C Melander

A number of 2-aminobenzimidazole derivatives were synthesized and screened for their ability to inhibit and disperse bacterial biofilms. From these compounds, a lead 2-aminobenzimidazole was identified that both inhibited and dispersed MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms. Mechanistic studies showed that the activity is Zn(II)-dependent, potentially via a direct zinc-chelating mechanism.
