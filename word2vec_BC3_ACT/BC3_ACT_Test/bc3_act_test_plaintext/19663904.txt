Plant oxylipins: plant responses to 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid are governed by its specific structural and functional properties.

C BÃ¶ttcher, S Pollmann

One of the most challenging questions in modern plant science is how plants regulate their morphological and developmental adaptation in response to changes in their biotic and abiotic environment. A comprehensive elucidation of the underlying mechanisms will help shed light on the extremely efficient strategies of plants in terms of survival and propagation. In recent years, a number of environmental stress conditions have been described as being mediated by signaling molecules of the oxylipin family. In this context, jasmonic acid, its biosynthetic precursor, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), and also reactive electrophilic species such as phytoprostanes play pivotal roles. Although our understanding of jasmonic acid-dependent processes and jasmonic acid signal-transduction cascades has made considerable progress in recent years, knowledge of the regulation and mode of action of OPDA-dependent plant responses is just emerging. This minireview focuses on recent work concerned with the elucidation of OPDA-specific processes in plants. In this context, aspects such as the differential recruitment of OPDA, either by de novo biosynthesis or by release from cyclo-oxylipin-galactolipids, and the conjugation of free OPDA are discussed.
