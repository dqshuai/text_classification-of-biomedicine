Twenty-four new sesterterpenes, compounds 1-24, were isolated from the aerial parts of Salvia dominica. Their structures were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR experiments as well as ESIMS analysis and chemical methods. The evaluation of the biological activity of Salvia dominica sesterterpenes by means of a panel of chemical and biological approaches, including chemical proteomics, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements, and biochemical assays were realized. Obtained results showed that 18 out of the 24 sesterterpene lactones isolated from Salvia dominica interact with tubulin-tyrosine ligase (TTL) an enzyme involved in the tyrosination cycle of the C-terminal of tubulin, and inhibit TTL activity in cancer cells. Besides, results of our studies provided an activity/structure relationship that can be used to design effective TTL inhibitors.
