Francisella tularensis is the causative agent of zoonotic tularemia, a severe pneumonia in humans, and Francisella novicida causes a similarly severe tularemia in mice upon inhalation. The correlates of protective immunity, as well as the virulence mechanisms of this deadly pathogen, are not well understood. In the present study, we compared the host immune responses of lethally infected and vaccinated mice to highlight the host determinants of protection from this disease. Intranasal infection with an attenuated mutant (Mut) of F. novicida lacking a 58-kDa hypothetical protein protected C57BL/6 mice from a subsequent challenge with the fully virulent wild-type strain U112 via the same route. The protection conferred by Mut vaccination was associated with reduced bacterial burdens in systemic organs, as well as the absence of bacteremia. Also, there was reduced lung pathology and associated cell death in the lungs of vaccinated mice. Both vaccinated and nonvaccinated mice displayed an initial 2-day delay in upregulation of signature inflammatory mediators after challenge. Whereas the nonvaccinated mice developed severe sepsis characterized by hypercytokinemia and T-cell depletion, the vaccinated mice displayed moderated cytokine induction and contained increased numbers of alphabeta T cells. The recall response in vaccinated mice consisted of a characteristic Th1-type response in terms of cytokines, as well as antibody isotypes. Our results show that a regulated Th1 type of cell-mediated and humoral immunity in the absence of severe sepsis is associated with protection from respiratory tularemia, whereas a deregulated host response leading to severe sepsis contributes to mortality.
