The combination of irradiation with angiogenic inhibition is increasingly being investigated for treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We investigated whether vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) inhibitor DC101 affects morbidity and tumor growth in irradiated and non-irradiated intracerebral GBM-bearing mice, controlled with sham treatments. End-points were toxicity, morbidity and histology. Irradiation either or not combined, reduced tumor size strongly, whereas DC101 mono-treatment reduced tumor size by 64%. Irradiation delayed morbidity from 5.8 weeks in sham-treated mice to 10.3 weeks. Morbidity after combined treatment occurred after 5.9 weeks. Treatment with angiogenesis inhibitor DC101 delays tumor growth but it induces morbidity, by itself or combined with irradiation.
