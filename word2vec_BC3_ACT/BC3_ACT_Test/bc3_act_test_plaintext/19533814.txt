Experience of limited pancreatic head resection for management of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in a single center.

KY Paik, SH Choi

AIM: To share our surgical experience and the outcome of limited pancreatic head resection for the management of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). METHODS: Between May 2005 and February 2008, nine limited pancreatic head resections (LPHR) were performed for IPMN of the pancreatic head. We reviewed the nine patients, retrospectively. RESULTS: Tumor was located in the uncinate process of the pancreas in all nine patients. Three patients had stents inserted in the main pancreatic duct due to injury. The mean size of tumor was 28.4 mm. Postoperative complications were found in five patients: 3 pancreatic leakages, a pancreatitis, and a duodenal stricture. Pancreatic leakages were improved by external drainage. No perioperative mortality was observed and all patients are recorded alive during the mean follow-up period of 17.2 mo. CONCLUSION: In selected patients after careful evaluation, LPHR can be used for the treatment of branch duct type IPMN. In order to avoid pancreatic ductal injury, pre- and intra-operative definite localization and careful operative techniques are required.
