Production of Clostridium difficile toxin in a medium totally free of both animal and dairy proteins or digests.

A Fang, DF Gerson, AL Demain

In the hope of developing a vaccine against Clostridium difficile based on its toxin(s), we have developed a fermentation medium for the bacterium that results in the formation of Toxin A and contains no meat or dairy products, thus obviating the problem of possible prion diseases. Particular preparations of hydrolyzed soy proteins, especially Soy Peptone A3, have been found to replace both the meat/dairy product tryptone in the preparation of working cell banks and seed media, and NZ-Soy BL4 does the same in the fermentation medium. These replacements yield even higher toxin titers.
