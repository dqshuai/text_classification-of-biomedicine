We evaluated the teratoma-forming propensity of secondary neurospheres (SNS) generated from 36 mouse induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines derived in 11 different ways. Teratoma-formation of SNS from embryonic fibroblast-derived iPS cells was similar to that of SNS from embryonic stem (ES) cells. In contrast, SNS from iPS cells derived from different adult tissues varied substantially in their teratoma-forming propensity, which correlated with the persistence of undifferentiated cells.
