Cell-derived microparticles: a new challenge in neuroscience.

L Doeuvre, L Plawinski, F Toti, E Angl√©s-Cano

Microparticles (MPs) are membrane fragments shed by cells activated by a variety of stimuli including serine proteases, inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and stress inducers. MPs originating from platelets, leukocytes, endothelial cells, and erythrocytes are found in circulating blood at relative concentrations determined by the pathophysiological context. The procoagulant activity of MPs is their most characterized property as a determinant of thrombosis in various vascular and systemic diseases including myocardial infarction and diabetes. An increase in circulating MPs has also been associated with ischemic cerebrovascular accidents, transient ischemic attacks, multiple sclerosis, and cerebral malaria. Recent data indicate that besides their procoagulant components and identity antigens, MPs bear a number of bioactive effectors that can be disseminated, exchanged, and transferred via MPs cell interactions. Furthermore, as activated parenchymal cells may also shed MPs carrying identity antigens and biomolecules, MPs are now emerging as new messengers/biomarkers from a specific tissue undergoing activation or damage. Thus, detection of MPs of neurovascular origin in biological fluids such as CSF or tears, and even in circulating blood in case of blood-brain barrier leakage, would not only improve our comprehension of neurovascular pathophysiology, but may also constitute a powerful tool as a biomarker in disease prediction, diagnosis, prognosis, and follow-up.
