Targeting the molecular defect in BRCA-deficient tumors for cancer therapy.

AR Venkitaraman

Targeted therapies exploiting specific molecular defects in cancer cells promise to overcome roadblocks in the development of effective anticancer drugs. A recent report in the New England Journal of Medicine on the early clinical evaluation of Olaparib in cancers lacking the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes exemplifies this promising new trend.
