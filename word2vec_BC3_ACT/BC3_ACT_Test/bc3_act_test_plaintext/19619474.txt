Hydration and hydrodynamic interactions of lysozyme: effects of chaotropic versus kosmotropic ions.

AS Parmar, M Muschol

Using static and dynamic light scattering we have investigated the effects of either strongly chaotropic, nearly neutral or strongly kosmotropic salt ions on the hydration shell and the mutual hydrodynamic interactions of the protein lysozyme under conditions supportive of protein crystallization. After accounting for the effects of protein interaction and for changes in solution viscosity on protein diffusivity, protein hydrodynamic radii were determined with +/-0.25 A resolution. No changes to the extent of lysozyme hydration were discernible for all salt-types, at any salt concentration and for temperatures between 15-40 degrees C. Combining static with dynamic light scattering, we also investigated salt-induced changes to the hydrodynamic protein interactions. With increased salt concentration, hydrodynamic interactions changed from attractive to repulsive, i.e., in exact opposition to salt-induced changes in direct protein interactions. This anti-correlation was independent of solution temperature or salt identity. Although salt-specific effects on direct protein interactions were prominent, neither protein hydration nor solvent-mediated hydrodynamic interactions displayed any obvious salt-specific effects. We infer that the protein hydration shell is more resistant than bulk water to changes in its local structure by either chaotropic or kosmotropic ions.
