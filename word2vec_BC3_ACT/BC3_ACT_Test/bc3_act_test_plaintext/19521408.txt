UVB and UVA initiate different pathways to p53-dependent apoptosis in melanocytes.

FP Noonan, EC De Fabo

The incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) has more than doubled in the past 25 years and continues to increase at over 3% per year across all age groups (Linos et al., this issue), and invasive and disseminated melanoma in young women has increased by almost 10% since 1992 (Purdue et al., 2008). Early detection and excision of CMM can result in successful treatment, but disseminated disease is resistant to current therapies and has a very poor prognosis (Garbe and Eigentler, 2007). Sunlight exposure is a major risk factor for melanoma. In this issue, Waster and llinger investigate the effects of UVB and UVA on melanocytes.
