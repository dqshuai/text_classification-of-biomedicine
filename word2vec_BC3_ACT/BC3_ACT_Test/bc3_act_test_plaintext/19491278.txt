Tumor-draining lymph nodes (DLN) are the most important priming sites for generation of antitumor immune responses. They are also the location where an immunosuppressive cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), plays a critical role in suppressing these antitumor immune responses. We focused on TGF-beta-mediated immunosuppression in DLNs and examined whether local inhibition of TGF-beta augmented antitumor immune responses systemically in tumor-bearing mice models. For inhibition of TGF-beta-mediated immunosuppression in DLNs, C57BL/6 mice subcutaneously bearing E.G7 tumors were administered plasmid DNA encoding the extracellular domain of TGF-beta type II receptor fused to the human IgG heavy chain (TGFR DNA) i.m. near the established tumor. In DLNs, inhibition of TGF-beta suppressed the proliferation of regulatory T cells and increased the number of tumor antigen-specific CD4(+) or CD8(+) cells producing IFN-gamma. Enhancement of antitumor immune responses in DLNs were associated with augmented tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic and natural killer activity in spleen as well as elevated levels of tumor-specific antibody in sera. The growth of the established metastatic as well as primary tumors was effectively suppressed via augmented antitumor immune responses. Inhibition of TGF-beta-mediated immunosuppression in DLNs is significantly associated with augmented antitumor responses by various immunocompetent cell types. This animal model provides a novel rationale for molecular cancer therapeutics targeting TGF-beta.
