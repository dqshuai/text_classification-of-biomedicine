The mechanisms preventing efficient remyelination in the adult mammalian central nervous system after demyelinating inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, are largely unknown. Partial remyelination occurs in early disease stages, but repair capacity diminishes over time and with disease progression. We describe a potent candidate for the negative regulation of oligodendroglial differentiation that may underlie failure to remyelinate. The p57kip2 gene is dynamically regulated in the spinal cord during MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Transient down-regulation indicated that it is a negative regulator of post-mitotic oligodendroglial differentiation. We then applied short hairpin RNA-mediated gene suppression to cultured oligodendroglial precursor cells and demonstrated that down-regulation of p57kip2 accelerates morphological maturation and promotes myelin expression. We also provide evidence that p57kip2 interacts with LIMK-1, implying that p57kip2 affects cytoskeletal dynamics during oligodendroglial maturation. These data suggest that sustained down-regulation of p57kip2 is important for oligodendroglial maturation and open perspectives for future therapeutic approaches to overcome the endogenous remyelination blockade in multiple sclerosis.
