Homologue pairing: getting it right.

RS Hawley, WD Gilliland

In Caernorhabditis elegans, homologue pairing is mediated by specialized regions near one end of each chromosome in conjunction with zinc finger (ZnF)-bearing proteins. Families of repeated sequences that are enriched within these regions have now been identified. By recruiting their cognate ZnF-bearing proteins, these regions promote pairing and synapsis.
