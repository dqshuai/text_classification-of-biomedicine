Right trisegmentectomy with thoracoabdominal approach after transarterial embolization for giant hepatic hemangioma.

HI Seo, HJ Jo, MS Sim, S Kim

Hepatic hemangiomas need to be treated surgically in cases where they are accompanied with symptoms, have a risk of rupture, or are hardly distinguishable from malignancy. The present authors conducted embolization of the right hepatic artery one day before an operation for a huge hemangioma accompanied with symptoms and confirmed a decrease in its size. The authors performed a right trisegmentectomy through a J-shape incision, using a thoracoabdominal approach, and safely removed a giant hemangioma of 32.0 cm x 26.5 cm x 8.0 cm in size and 2300 g in weight. Even for inexperienced surgeons, a J-shape incision with a thoracoabdominal approach is considered a safe and useful method when right-side hepatectomy is required for a large mass in the right liver.
