AIM: To explore the relation between B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi-1) expression and the clinicopathological features of gastric carcinoma (GC). METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of Bmi-1 and ki-67. Double-labeling staining was used to display the distribution of Bcl-2(+)/ki-67(-) cells in 162 cases of GC and its matched normal mucosa and precancerous lesion. RESULTS: The positive rate of Bmi-1 expression in GC (52.5%) was significantly higher than that in normal gastric mucosa (21.6%, chi(2) = 33.088, P < 0.05). The Bmi-1 expression in GC was closely related with the Lauren's and Borrmann's classification and clinical stage (chi(2) = 4.400, 6.122 and 11.190, respectively, P < 0.05). The expression of ki-67 was related to the Borrmann's classification (chi(2) = 13.380, P < 0.05). Bcl-2 expression was correlated with the Lauren's classification (chi(2) = 4.725, P < 0.05), and the Bmi-1 expression both in GC (r(k) = 0.157, P < 0.05) and in intestinal metaplasia (r(k) = 0.270, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Abnormal Bmi-1 expression in GC may be involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis and cancerization. This marker can objectively indicate the clinicopathological characteristics of GC.
