Inflammatory bowel disease-associated spondyloarthropathies.

W Fries

This issue presents a symposium held in Messina talking about inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and associated spondyloarthropathies. The topic covers epidemiology and clinical manifestations of IBD-related arthropathies, common genetic and immunologic features, combined therapies for gut and joint inflammation, and future biologic therapies etc. I believe this series of articles will deeply facilitate understanding of and the approach to IBD and associated arthropathies.
