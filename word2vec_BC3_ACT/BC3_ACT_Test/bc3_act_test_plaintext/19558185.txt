Efficient charge transport in DNA diblock oligomers.

The realization of highly efficient photoinduced charge separation across the pi-stacked base pairs in duplex DNA remains elusive. The low efficiencies (<5%) typically observed for charge separation over a dozen or more base pairs are a consequence of slow charge transport and rapid charge recombination. We report here a significant (5-fold or greater) enhancement in the efficiency of charge separation in diblock purine oligomers consisting of two or three adenines followed by several guanines, when compared to oligomers consisting of a single purine or alternating base sequences. This approach to wire-like behavior is attributed to both slower charge recombination and faster charge transport once the charge reaches the G-block in these diblock systems.
