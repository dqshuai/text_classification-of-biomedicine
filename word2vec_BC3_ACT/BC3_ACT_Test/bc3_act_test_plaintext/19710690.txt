Migration of dendritic cells (DCs) from skin to lymph nodes on activation is an essential step in the initiation of an adequate immune response. The dermal microenvironment including stromal cells and their soluble factors might be involved in the regulation of DC migration. To focus on the role of dermal fibroblasts, we studied whether interaction of DCs with fibroblasts promotes the migration of DCs. DCs were co-cultured with resting fibroblasts or with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha/IL-1beta-activated fibroblasts to mimic an inflammatory microenvironment. Interaction of DCs with TNFalpha/IL-1beta-stimulated fibroblasts increased the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) from DCs within 6 hours compared with DCs alone or DCs stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or TNFalpha/IL-1beta. In contrast, unstimulated fibroblasts did not affect MMP-9 secretion. IL-6 released by TNFalpha/IL-1beta-stimulated fibroblasts was identified as a factor responsible for fibroblast-stimulated MMP-9 secretion from DCs. In accordance with the elevated MMP-9 release, on co-culture with TNFalpha/IL-1beta-stimulated fibroblasts, DCs migrated significantly more effectively through matrigel matrices than did TNFalpha/IL-1beta-stimulated DCs. This was inhibited by a selective blocking of MMP-9, indicating the importance of MMP-9 for this migratory capacity of DCs. In summary, fibroblasts in the local dermal microenvironment are capable of potentiating the migratory capacity of DCs, and thus have the potential to actively participate in the regulation of a cutaneous immune response.
