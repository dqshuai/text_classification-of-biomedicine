Chemical signalling: laser on the fly reveals a new male-specific pheromone.

JD Levine, JG Millar

A study using laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry has identified new oxygenated compounds in cuticular lipids of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster; one such compound, when transferred to females during mating, renders the females unattractive to males for days.
