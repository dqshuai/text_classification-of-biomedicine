ARAP1 is a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3))-dependent Arf GTPase-activating protein (GAP) with five PH domains that regulates endocytic trafficking of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Two tandem PH domains are immediately N-terminal of the Arf GAP domain, and one of these fits the consensus sequence for PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) binding. Here, we tested the hypothesis that PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)-dependent recruitment mediated by the first PH domain of ARAP1 regulates the in vivo and in vitro function of ARAP1. We found that PH1 of ARAP1 specifically bound to PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), but with relatively low affinity (approximately 1.6 microm), and the PH domains did not mediate PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)-dependent recruitment to membranes in cells. However, PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) binding to the PH domain stimulated GAP activity and was required for in vivo function of ARAP1 as a regulator of endocytic trafficking of the EGFR. Based on these results, we propose a variation on the model for the function of phosphoinositide-binding PH domains. In our model, ARAP1 is recruited to membranes independently of PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), the subsequent production of which triggers enzymatic activity.
