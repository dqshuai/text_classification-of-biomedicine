Production of both IL-27 and IFN-gamma after the treatment with a ligand for invariant NK T cells is responsible for the suppression of Th2 response and allergic inflammation in a mouse experimental asthma model.

Using an allergen-induced airway inflammation model, we show that an injection of alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer), a ligand for invariant NK T (iNKT) cells, induced IL-27 and that this process is essential for the attenuation of the Th2 response. After the systemic administration of alpha-GalCer into the mice primed with OVA in alum, Th2 cytokine production of OVA-primed CD4(+) T cells in their lymph nodes, IgG1 and IgE Ab formation, and infiltration of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage after the OVA challenge were suppressed. Systemic administration of rIFN-gamma into OVA-primed mice could not reproduce these effects of alpha-GalCer. IL-27p28 was detected both in the culture supernatant of alpha-GalCer-stimulated spleen cells and in the serum of the alpha-GalCer-treated mice, but not in the iNKT cell-deficient mice. Splenic iNKT cells produced IL-27p28 in the culture supernatant upon stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin, although the transcript of IL-27p28 in the iNKT cells was constitutively expressed regardless of the stimulation. By contrast, the transcript of IL-27EBI3 was induced in the iNKT cells upon stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin in vitro and with alpha-GalCer treatment in vivo, suggesting that IL-27 (p28/EBI3) could be produced by iNKT cells in an activation-dependent manner. Although repeated injections of rIL-27 did not substitute for the effects of a single injection of alpha-GalCer, administration of rIL-27 along with rIFN-gamma reproduced in vivo effects of the alpha-GalCer injection. These data indicate that production of both IL-27 and IFN-gamma by the alpha-GalCer treatment is responsible for suppression of the Th2 response and allergic inflammation.
