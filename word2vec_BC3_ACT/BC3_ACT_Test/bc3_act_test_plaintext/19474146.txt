RNA

A conserved motif of vertebrate Y RNAs essential for chromosomal DNA replication.

Noncoding Y RNAs are required for the reconstitution of chromosomal DNA replication in late G1 phase template nuclei in a human cell-free system. Y RNA genes are present in all vertebrates and in some isolated nonvertebrates, but the conservation of Y RNA function and key determinants for its function are unknown. Here, we identify a determinant of Y RNA function in DNA replication, which is conserved throughout vertebrate evolution. Vertebrate Y RNAs are able to reconstitute chromosomal DNA replication in the human cell-free DNA replication system, but nonvertebrate Y RNAs are not. A conserved nucleotide sequence motif in the double-stranded stem of vertebrate Y RNAs correlates with Y RNA function. A functional screen of human Y1 RNA mutants identified this conserved motif as an essential determinant for reconstituting DNA replication in vitro. Double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides comprising this RNA motif are sufficient to reconstitute DNA replication, but corresponding DNA or random sequence RNA oligonucleotides are not. In intact cells, wild-type hY1 or the conserved RNA duplex can rescue an inhibition of DNA replication after RNA interference against hY3 RNA. Therefore, we have identified a new RNA motif that is conserved in vertebrate Y RNA evolution, and essential and sufficient for Y RNA function in human chromosomal DNA replication.
