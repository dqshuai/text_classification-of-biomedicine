The aim of the present study was to investigate different yam treatments, including powdered-yam-products (PYP) and liquid-yam-products (LYP), with respect to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) blood pressure. PYP included alcohol-insoluble-solids of yam tuber, hot-air-drying (HAD) of yam tuber slices, steam-cooked once or twice followed by HAD which were subsequently powdered. LYP included water extracts of yam tuber (WEY) heated at 90 degrees C (WEY90H) or 95 degrees C for 10 min (WEY95H), and then stored at 4 degrees C for different numbers of day. PYP, WEY, and WEYH were found effectively to reduce the blood pressure of SHR and should be beneficial in food processing in the development of functional foods for blood pressure regulation.
