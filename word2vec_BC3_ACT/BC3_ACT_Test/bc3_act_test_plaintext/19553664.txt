Bile acid-induced epidermal growth factor receptor activation in quiescent rat hepatic stellate cells can trigger both proliferation and apoptosis.

Bile acids have been reported to induce epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and subsequent proliferation of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC), but the underlying mechanisms and whether quiescent HSC are also a target for bile acid-induced proliferation or apoptosis remained unclear. Therefore, primary rat HSC were cultured for up to 48 h and analyzed for their proliferative/apoptotic responses toward bile acids. Hydrophobic bile acids, i.e. taurolithocholate 3-sulfate, taurochenodeoxycholate, and glycochenodeoxycholate, but not taurocholate or tauroursodeoxycholate, induced Yes-dependent EGFR phosphorylation. Simultaneously, hydrophobic bile acids induced phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidase subunit p47(phox) and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS production was sensitive to inhibition of acidic sphingomyelinase, protein kinase Czeta, and NADPH oxidases. All maneuvers which prevented bile acid-induced ROS formation also prevented Yes and subsequent EGFR phosphorylation. Taurolithocholate 3-sulfate-induced EGFR activation was followed by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, and stimulated HSC proliferation. When, however, a JNK signal was induced by coadministration of cycloheximide or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), activated EGFR associated with CD95 and triggered EGFR-mediated CD95-tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent formation of the death-inducing signaling complex. In conclusion, hydrophobic bile acids lead to a NADPH oxidase-driven ROS generation followed by a Yes-mediated EGFR activation in quiescent primary rat HSC. This proliferative signal shifts to an apoptotic signal when a JNK signal simultaneously comes into play.
