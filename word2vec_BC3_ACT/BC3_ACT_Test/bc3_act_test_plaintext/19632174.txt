RIP kinases at the crossroads of cell death and survival.

W Declercq, T Vanden Berghe, P Vandenabeele

Protein kinases of the receptor interacting protein (RIP) family collaborate with death receptor proteins to regulate cell death. Recent studies (Cho et al., 2009; He et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009) reveal that the RIP3 kinase functions with RIP1 at the crossroads of apoptosis, necroptosis, and cell survival.
