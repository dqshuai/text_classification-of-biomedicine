Volicitin [N-(17-hydroxylinolenoyl)-L-glutamine] has previously been identified from the lepidopteran larval regurgitant as an elicitor of plant volatile emission. The efficient incorporation of free oxygen into volicitin by Spodoptera litura larvae is demonstrated here by rearing them under (18)O(2) for three days. (18)O-labeling of the hydroxyl group of volicitin was confirmed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-ion trap-time-of-flight (LC/MS-IT-TOF) and suggests the activity of a monooxygenase in volicitin biosynthesis.
