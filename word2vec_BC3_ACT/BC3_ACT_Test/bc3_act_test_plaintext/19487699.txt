Cab45b is a cytosolic Ca(2+)-binding protein reported to regulate zymogen secretion in pancreatic acini. We now show that Cab45b is also expressed in pancreatic islet beta-cells and interacts there with the Sec1-Munc18 protein Munc18b. We employed patch clamp cell capacitance measurements to show that antibodies against Cab45b inhibited depolarization-evoked membrane capacitance increments, suggesting an impact on beta-cell granule exocytosis, both the readily releasable granule pool and refilling of this pool. Site-specific mutants in the Cab45b EF-hands were used to dissect the molecular interactions involved in Cab45b function. Mutants in EF-hands 2 and 3 had no detectable effects on interaction of Cab45b with Munc18b and did not affect the depolarization-evoked calcium currents, but remarkably, they facilitated the complex formation of Munc18b with syntaxin-2 and -3. As a result, these two EF-hand mutants inhibited beta-cell membrane capacitance increments. This inhibition is mediated via Munc18b because Munc18b silencing with small interfering RNA abolished the effects of these two mutants. The results suggest a mechanism for Cab45b action that involves regulating the dynamic association of Munc18b with SNAREs to impact beta-cell granule exocytosis.
