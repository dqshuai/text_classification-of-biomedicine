Upregulation of myostatin gene expression in streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes mice is attenuated by insulin.

Myostatin is a strong inhibitor of muscle growth, and its expression is increased in several types of muscle atrophy. However, whether or not myostatin expression is altered in muscle atrophy associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains uncertain. In this study, we provided experimental evidence to show that myostatin mRNA increased in the early stage of T1D but came back to control levels later on. This expression pattern was closely correlated with the loss of body weight and atrogin-1 expression. Furthermore, induction of myostatin expression could be attenuated by insulin in T1D mice. Taken together, our findings indicate that the upregulation of myostatin expression most likely contributes to the muscle atrophy process during insulin deficiency.
