The curious case of bivalent marks.

HM Herz, S Nakanishi, A Shilatifard

Bivalently marked chromatin, containing both histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and H3K27 trimethylation, is a hallmark of developmentally regulated paused promoters in mammalian embryonic stem cells. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Akkers et al. report that Xenopus tropicalis embryos transition through early development without the requirement for bivalently marked promoters.
