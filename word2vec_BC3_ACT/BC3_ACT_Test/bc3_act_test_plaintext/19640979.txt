Vector insect cells infected with Rice gall dwarf virus, a member of the family Reoviridae, contained the virus-associated microtubules adjacent to the viroplasms, as revealed by transmission electron, electron tomographic, and confocal microscopy. The viroplasms, putative sites of viral replication, contained the nonstructural viral proteins Pns7 and Pns12, as well as core protein P5, of the virus. Microtubule-depolymerizing drugs suppressed the association of viral particles with microtubules and prevented the release of viruses from cells without significantly affecting viral multiplication. Thus, microtubules appear to mediate viral transport within and release of viruses from infected vector cells.
