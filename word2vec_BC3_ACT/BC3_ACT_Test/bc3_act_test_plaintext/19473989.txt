Streptococcus pyogenes can cause invasive diseases in humans, such as sepsis or necrotizing fasciitis. Among the various M serotypes of group A streptococci (GAS), M3 GAS lacks the major epithelial invasins SfbI/PrtF1 and M1 protein but has a high potential to cause invasive disease. We examined the uptake of M3 GAS into human endothelial cells and identified host signaling factors required to initiate streptococcal uptake. Bacterial uptake is accompanied by local F-actin accumulation and formation of membrane protrusions at the entry site. We found that Src kinases and Rac1 but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are essential to mediate S. pyogenes internalization. Pharmacological inhibition of Src activity reduced bacterial uptake and abolished the formation of membrane protrusions and actin accumulation in the vicinity of adherent streptococci. We found that Src kinases are activated in a time-dependent manner in response to M3 GAS. We also demonstrated that PI3K is dispensable for internalization of M3 streptococci and the formation of F-actin accumulations at the entry site. Furthermore, Rac1 was activated in infected cells and accumulated with F-actin in a PI3K-independent manner at bacterial entry sites. Genetic interference with Rac1 function inhibited streptococcal internalization, demonstrating an essential role of Rac1 for the uptake process of streptococci into endothelial cells. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time accumulation of the actin nucleation complex Arp2/3 at the entry port of invading M3 streptococci.
