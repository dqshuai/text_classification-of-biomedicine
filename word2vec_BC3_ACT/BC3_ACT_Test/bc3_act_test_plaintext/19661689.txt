The relationship between the stereochemistry and antimicrobial activity of butane-type lignans was clarified. All stereoisomers of dihydroguaiaretic acid (DGA) showed both antibacterial and antifungal activity. The (+)- and (-)-7,7'-dioxodihydroguaiaretic acid (ODGA) also showed both antibacterial and antifungal activity, while meso-ODGA did not show antibacterial activity, but showed antifungal activity. No activity of any stereoisomer of secoisolariciresinol (SECO) was apparent.
