Ir-catalyzed cross-coupling of styrene derivatives with allylic carbonates: free amine assisted vinyl C-H bond activation.

H He, WB Liu, LX Dai, SL You

Iridium complex derived from [Ir(COD)Cl](2)/Feringa's ligand is an efficient catalytic system for the cross-coupling reaction between allyl carbonates and o-amino styrene derivatives, affording skipped Z, E dienes. The reaction features ready availability of the starting materials, mild reaction conditions, high yields, and excellent stereoselectivity.
