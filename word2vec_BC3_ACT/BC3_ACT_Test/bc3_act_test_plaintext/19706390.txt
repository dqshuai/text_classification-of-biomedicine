Placental abnormalities occur frequently in cloned animals. Here, we attempted to isolate trophoblast stem (TS) cells from mouse blastocysts produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (NT) at the blastocyst stage (NT blastocysts). Despite the predicted deficiency of the trophoblast cell lineage, we succeeded in isolating cell colonies with typical morphology of TS cells and cell lines from the NT blastocysts (ntTS cell lines) with efficiency as high as that from native blastocysts. The established 10 ntTS cell lines could be maintained in the undifferentiated state and induced to differentiate into several trophoblast subtypes in vitro. A comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional and epigenetic traits demonstrated that ntTS cells were indistinguishable from control TS cells. In addition, ntTS cells contributed exclusively to the placenta and survived until term in chimeras, indicating that ntTS cells have developmental potential as stem cells. Taken together, our data show that NT blastocysts contain cells that can produce TS cells in culture, suggesting that proper commitment to the trophoblast cell lineage in NT embryos occurs by the blastocyst stage.
