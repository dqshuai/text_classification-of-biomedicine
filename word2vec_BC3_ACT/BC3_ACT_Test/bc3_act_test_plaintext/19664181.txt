Recent advances in systemic therapy: Advances in systemic therapy for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2 over-expression is associated with a shortened disease-free interval and poor survival. Although the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy in the first-line setting has improved response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival, response rates declined when trastuzumab was used beyond the first-line setting because of multiple mechanisms of resistance. Studies have demonstrated the clinical utility of continuing trastuzumab beyond progression, and further trials to explore this concept are ongoing. New tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) pathway regulators, HER2 antibody-drug conjugates, and inhibitors of heat shock protein-90 are being evaluated to determine whether they may have a role to play in treating trastuzumab-resistant metastatic breast cancer.
