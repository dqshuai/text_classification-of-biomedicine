Can the protein occupancy landscape show the topologically isolated chromosomal domains in the E. coli genome?: An exciting prospect.

BK Cho, BÃ˜ Palsson

In a recent issue of Molecular Cell, Vora et al. (2009) introduce an in vivo protein occupancy display (IPOD) technology and propose that the domains extensively occupied by proteins with inactive transcription in bacteria are mainly topologically isolated chromosomal domains.
