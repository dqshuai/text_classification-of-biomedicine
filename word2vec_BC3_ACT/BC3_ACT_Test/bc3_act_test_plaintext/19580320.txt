4-Deoxy-alpha-GalCer analogues are considered weaker agonists than KRN7000 for the stimulation of human iNKT cells, but this remains strongly debated. In this work, we described a strategy toward 4-deoxy-alpha-GalCers with, as a key step, a metathesis reaction allowing sphingosine modifications from a single ethylenic alpha-galactoside precursor. The 4-deoxy-KRN7000 derivative 2, described here, induced potent cytokinic responses, comparable to those of KRN7000, both from human iNKT cells in vitro and from their murine counterpart in vivo.
