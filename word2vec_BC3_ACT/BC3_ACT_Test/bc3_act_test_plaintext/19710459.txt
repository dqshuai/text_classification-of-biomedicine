Regulation of murine splenic B cell CR3 expression by complement component 3.

AC Jacobson, KM Roundy, JJ Weis, JH Weis

Complement component C3 has established roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses. C3 cleavage products function in B cell activation through the complement receptors CD21/35. Phenotypes of Ab production between CD21/35(-/-) and C3(-/-) mice are not always congruent, implicating additional roles for C3 in B cell responses. To further characterize complement and complement receptors, we have identified a role for C3 in the regulation of CR3 on splenic B cells. Splenic B2 cells are not defined as expressing CR3, yet the analysis of splenic B cells from C3(-/-) animals demonstrate cell surface expression of CR3. B cells from both wild-type (WT) and C3(-/-) animals express CR3/CD11b/Itgam (integrin alpha M) gene transcripts although the level of such transcripts is 2- to 3-fold higher in B cells from the C3(-/-) animal vs WT cells. C3(-/-) and WT animals have similar B cell subpopulations with identical CR3 expression on B220(-) cells from the spleen, marrow, and lymph nodes. The C3-deficient environment is responsible for altered CR3 expression as WT splenic B cells transferred into C3(-/-) animals expressed cell surface CR3 within 48 h while transfer of C3(-/-) splenic B cells into WT animals depressed surface expression of CR3. Furthermore, transfer of C3-producing splenic macrophages into C3(-/-) mice depressed CR3 expression by resident B cells. These data suggest a role for C3 in influencing the level of expression of CR3 by modulating the transcript levels encoding the CD11b alpha integrin protein.
