A novel insertion sequence derepresses efflux pump expression and preadapts Pseudomonas putida S12 for extreme solvent stress.

X Sun, JJ Dennis

A multidrug efflux pump, SrpABC, plays a key role in Pseudomonas putida S12 tolerance to toxic organic solvents. SrpRS are putative regulators of the SrpABC efflux pump encoded upstream of the srpABC structural genes, and previous studies suggest that SrpS is a repressor of SrpABC expression. An S12 isolate able to withstand extreme solvent stress carries a novel insertion sequence, ISPpu21, interrupting srpS. This insertion preadapts S12 to extreme solvent conditions through constitutive SrpABC expression.
