Bacterial biofilms are responsible for the majority of all microbial infections and have profound impact on industrial and geochemical processes. While many studies documented phenotypic differentiation and gene regulation of biofilms, the importance of their structural and mechanical properties is poorly understood. Here we investigate how changes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core capping in Pseudomonas aeruginosa affect biofilm structure through modification of adhesive, cohesive, and viscoelastic properties at an early stage of biofilm development. Microbead force spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy were used to characterize P. aeruginosa biofilm interactions with either glass substrata or bacterial lawns. Using isogenic migA, wapR, and rmlC mutants with defined LPS characteristics, we observed significant changes in cell mechanical properties among these strains compared to wild-type strain PAO1. Specifically, truncation of core oligosaccharides enhanced both adhesive and cohesive forces by up to 10-fold, whereas changes in instantaneous elasticity were correlated with the presence of O antigen. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy to quantify biofilm structural changes with respect to differences in LPS core capping, we observed that textural parameters varied with adhesion or the inverse of cohesion, while areal and volumetric parameters were linked to adhesion, cohesion, or the balance between them. In conclusion, this report demonstrated for the first time that changes in LPS expression resulted in quantifiable cellular mechanical changes that were correlated with structural changes in bacterial biofilms. Thus, the interplay between architectural and functional properties may be an important contributor to bacterial community survival.
