NPR1 in Plant Defense: It's Not over 'til It's Turned over.

MS Mukhtar, MT Nishimura, J Dangl

NPR1 is a key transcriptional coregulator in plant defense responses. In this issue, Spoel et al. (2009) demonstrate that proteasome-mediated degradation of NPR1 in the nucleus promotes efficient expression of defense response genes following infection and prevents spurious activation of defensive responses in the absence of infection.
