Bar the windows: an optimized strategy to survive drought and salt adversities.

XJ Song, M Matsuoka

Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is a central modulator of stomatal closure. It remains unknown, however, how the upstream regulation of H(2)O(2) homeostasis operates. In this issue of Genes & Development, Huang and colleagues (pp. 1805-1817) report that a novel C(2)H(2)-type transcription factor, drought and salt tolerance (DST), mediates H(2)O(2)-induced stomatal closure and abiotic stress tolerance.
