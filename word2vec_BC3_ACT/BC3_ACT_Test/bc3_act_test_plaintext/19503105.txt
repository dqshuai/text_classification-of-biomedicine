The immunological synapse (IS) is a cell-cell junction formed between CD4(+) T cells and dendritic cells (DCs). Here we show in vitro and in vivo that IS formation inhibits apoptosis of DCs. Consistent with these results, IS formation induced antiapoptotic signaling events, including activation of the kinase Akt1 and localization of the prosurvival transcription factor NF-kappaB and the proapoptotic transcription factor FOXO1 to the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase and Akt1 partially prevented the antiapoptotic effects of IS formation. Direct stimulation of the IS component CD40 on DCs leads to the activation of Akt1, suggesting the involvement of this receptor in the antiapoptotic effects observed upon IS formation.
