Reactive oxygen species-mediated kinase activation by dihydrotanshinone in tanshinones-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells.

WY Lee, KW Liu, JH Yeung

The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in tanshinones-induced apoptosis was investigated in HepG2 cells in this study. The major tanshinones (cryptotanshinone, dihydrotanshinone, tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA), isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza, inhibit cell growth and induce caspase-dependent apoptosis concentration-dependently, with dihydrotanshinone being the most potent. All four tanshinones were found to induce ROS generation, but only dihydrotanshinone can induce activation of p38 MAPK. The p38 MAPK activation by dihydrotanshinone was inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine pretreatment. It is thus concluded that ROS-mediated p38 MAPK activation plays a vital role in dihydrotanshinone-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells.
