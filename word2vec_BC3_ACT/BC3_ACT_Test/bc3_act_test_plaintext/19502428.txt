Kinase activity-independent regulation of cyclin pathway by GRK2 is essential for zebrafish early development.

G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) are known as a family of serine/threonine kinases that function as key regulators of GPCRs, as well as other types of receptors. Extensive studies of GRKs at the cellular and organismal levels have led to a consensus that GRK-catalyzed phosphorylation of receptors is the primary mechanism underlying their physiological functions. Here, we report that down-regulation of GRK2 in zebrafish embryos with GRK2 morpholino results in developmental early arrest and, interestingly, that this arrest can be rescued by exogenous expression of a GRK2 kinase-dead mutant, K220R. A physical interaction between GRK2 and cyclin B1 regulator patched homolog 1 (PTCH1), stimulated by Hedgehog (Hh), rather than GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of downstream targets, appears as the underlying mechanism. We identify residues 262-379 as the PTCH1-binding region (BP). Interaction of GRK2, K220R, and BP with PTCH1 reduces the association of PTCH1 with cyclin B1 and disrupts PTCH1-mediated inhibition of cyclin B1 nuclear translocation, whereas the PTCH1-binding deficient GRK2 mutant (Delta312-379) does not. Cell cycle and cell proliferation assays show that overexpressing PTCH1 remarkably inhibited cell growth and this effect could be attenuated by GRK2, K220R, or BP, but not Delta312-379. In vivo studies show that BP, as well as the nuclear-localizing cyclin B1 mutant, is effective in rescuing the early arrest phenotype in GRK2 knockdown embryos, but Delta312-379 is not. Our data thus reveal a novel kinase activity-independent function for GRK and establish a role for GRK2 as a cell-cycle regulator during early embryonic development.
