Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) needs to overcome cellular counter mechanisms such as to successfully propagate itself. Results of our recent studies show that overexpression of insulin-like growth factor II mRNA binding protein 1 (IMP1) inhibits production of infectious HIV-1 particles through adversely affecting virus maturation. Here, we report that IMP1 interacts with HIV-1 Rev protein and its ectopic expression causes relocation of Rev from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In accordance with this observation, ectopic expression of IMP1 severely diminishes Rev-dependent expression of CAT enzyme and disturbs HIV-1 RNA expression by causing accumulation of the multiple spliced viral RNA. Results of mutagenesis analysis further reveal that the KH4 domain represents the key element of IMP1 in modulating HIV-1 RNA expression. Taken together, these data suggest, in addition to hampering virus assembly, that IMP1 also has an effect on Rev-dependent viral RNA expression.
