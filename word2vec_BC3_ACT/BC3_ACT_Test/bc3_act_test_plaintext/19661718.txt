OsWRKY53, a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-responsive rice WRKY gene, has been found to be involved in defense responses in rice. We identified three tandem W-box elements, putative recognition sites for WRKY transcription factors, as cis elements that are essential to the elicitor-responsiveness of OsWRKY53 by deletion and mutation analysis of the promoter by dual luciferase assay.
