Water-dispersible gold nanoparticles functionalized with paramagnetic gadolinium have been fully characterized, and the NMRD profiles show very high relaxivities up to 1.5 T. Characterization using TEM images and dynamic light scattering indicate a particle size distribution from 2 to 15 nm. The gold cores of the nanoparticles do not contribute significantly to the overall magnetic moment.
