Human B cells are currently not known to produce the proapoptotic protease granzyme B (GrB) in physiological settings. We have discovered that BCR stimulation with either viral Ags or activating Abs in the context of the acute phase cytokine IL-21 can induce the secretion of substantial amounts of GrB by human B cells. Importantly, GrB response to viral Ags was significantly stronger in B cells from subjects recently vaccinated against the corresponding viruses as compared with unvaccinated subjects. GrB-secreting B cells featured a homogeneous CD19(+)CD20(+)CD27(-)CD38(-)IgD(-) phenotype, improved survival, and enhanced expression of costimulatory, Ag-presenting and cell-adhesion molecules. B cell-derived GrB was enzymatically active and its induction required the activation of similar signaling pathways as those in CTLs. Our findings suggest that GrB-secreting B cells support the early antiviral immune response against viruses with endosomal entry pathways, thereby counteracting overwhelming viral replication at the beginning of an infection until virus-specific T cells from draining lymph nodes arrive at the site of infection. Our data may also explain the elevated serum GrB levels found in the early phase of various viral diseases.
