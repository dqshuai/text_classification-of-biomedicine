The C-terminal fragment of C4b-binding protein (C4BP)-based multimerizing system was applied to hGM-CSF to induce dendritic cells (DCs) from peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs), to see whether the C4BP could stimulate immature DCs, since DCs, equipped with pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), are hypersensitive to various immunologically active molecules like LPS. hGM-CSF gene was merged to the 3'-terminal region of the C4BPalpha-chain gene, and the transfected human 293FT cells produced sufficient amount of octameric hGM-CSF, which resulted in iDCs with the same phenotype and the same response to a TRL4 ligand, LPS and a TLR3 ligand, poly I:C, as those induced with authentic monomeric hGM-CSF. These results suggest that the C4BP-based multimerizing system could facilitate the design of self-associating multimeric recombinant proteins without stimulating iDCs, which might be seen with the other multimerizing systems such as that using Fc fragment of IgM.
