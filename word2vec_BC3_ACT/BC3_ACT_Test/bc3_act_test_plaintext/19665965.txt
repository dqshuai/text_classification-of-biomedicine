DNA makes RNA makes innate immunity.

LA O'Neill

Microbial DNA in the cytosol induces production of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and an innate immune response. Chiu et al. (2009) now implicate cytosolic DNA-dependent RNA polymerase III as the DNA sensor linking DNA release by pathogenic bacteria and viruses in the host cell cytosol to IFN-beta production and innate immunity.
