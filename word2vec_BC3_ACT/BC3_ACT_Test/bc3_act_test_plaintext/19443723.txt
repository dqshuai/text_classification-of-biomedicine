PURPOSE: To determine the impact of the antiangiogenic factor alpha1(IV)NC1 on vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated proangiogenic activity in mouse retinal endothelial cells (MRECs). METHODS: Primary culture of MRECs was established as previously described and was used to determine the effects of alpha1(IV)NC1 on the proangiogenic activity of VEGF. Cell proliferation was evaluated using [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation and 3,(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide colorimetric assays. Cell migration was determined using modified Boyden chamber and scratch wound assays and tube formation was assessed on basement membrane matrix (BMM). Intracellular signaling events Bcl-2/Bcl-x(L) and caspase-3/poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activities were evaluated in cells stimulated with VEGF and plated on type IV collagen-coated dishes. Apoptosis was assessed by measuring caspase activity and by performing quantitative fluorescence analysis using fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay. Subcutaneously injected VEGF induced in vivo neovascularization was studied with the BMM plug assay. RESULTS: VEGF-induced subconfluent MREC proliferation, migration, and tube formation were significantly inhibited by alpha1(IV)NC1 at 1 muM (P < 0.001). alpha1(IV)NC1 induced MREC apoptosis is mediated by inhibition of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) expression and activation of caspase-3/PARP through FAK/p38-MAPK signaling. In addition, alpha1(IV)NC1 dose dependently inhibited VEGF-mediated neovascularization in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: alpha1(IV)NC1 inhibited VEGF-mediated angiogenesis by promoting apoptosis and caspase-3/PARP activation and by negatively impacting FAK/p38-MAPK phosphorylation, Bcl-2, and Bcl-x(L) expression leading to MREC death. The endothelial-specific inhibitory actions of recombinant alpha1(IV)NC1 may be of benefit in the treatment of a variety of eye diseases with a neovascular component.
