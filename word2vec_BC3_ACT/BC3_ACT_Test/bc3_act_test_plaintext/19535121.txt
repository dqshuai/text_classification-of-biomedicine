Primary human cells from different donors vary in their susceptibility to in vitro infection with HIV-1. In order to perform genetic analysis to identify host factors that affect HIV-1 susceptibility, it is important that a clear phenotype is defined. Here, we report a standardized method to study variation for in vitro HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) from large numbers of individuals. With this assay, HIV-1 susceptibility of MDM from 489 different donors shows more than 3 log variation and a good correlation with the 32 base pair deletion in the CCR5 co-receptor (ccr5 Delta 32 genotype) of the donors. However, in 7 of 12 donors completely resistant to infection with CCR5-using HIV-1, this was not explained by the ccr5 Delta 32 genotype, showing evidence that other host factors are likely to influence HIV-1 replication in MDM. Infections with VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 indeed confirmed the existence of post-entry level restrictions in MDM.
