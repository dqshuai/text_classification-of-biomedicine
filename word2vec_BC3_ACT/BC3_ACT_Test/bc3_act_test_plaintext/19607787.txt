It's lonely at the top: winning climbing fibers ascend dendrites solo.

RW Draft, JW Lichtman

In mammals, climbing fiber axons compete for sole innervation at each Purkinje cell. At the same time, synapses disappear from Purkinje somata and appear in great numbers on the dendrites. In this issue of Neuron, Hashimoto et al. show that, by the time climbing fibers ascend the dendrites, the winner and losers are already decided.
