Genetic p53 deficiency partially rescues the adrenocortical dysplasia phenotype at the expense of increased tumorigenesis.

Telomere dysfunction and shortening induce chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis. In this study, we analyze the adrenocortical dysplasia (acd) mouse, harboring a mutation in Tpp1/Acd. Additional loss of p53 dramatically rescues the acd phenotype in an organ-specific manner, including skin hyperpigmentation and adrenal morphology, but not germ cell atrophy. Survival to weaning age is significantly increased in Acd(acd/acd) p53(-/-) mice. On the contrary, p53(-/-) and p53(+/-) mice with the Acd(acd/acd) genotype show a decreased tumor-free survival, compared with Acd(+/+) mice. Tumors from Acd(acd/acd) p53(+/-) mice show a striking switch from the classic spectrum of p53(-/-) mice toward carcinomas. The acd mouse model provides further support for an in vivo role of telomere deprotection in tumorigenesis.
