Self-assembly of 1D nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes or nanorods into highly ordered superstructures using various interactions has been of great interest as a route toward materials with new functionalities. However, the phase behavior of 1D nanoparticles interacting with surrounding materials, which is the key information to design self-assembled superstructures, has not been fully exploited yet. Here, we report for the first time a new phase diagram of negatively charged 1D nanoparticle and cationic liposome (CLs) complexes in water that exhibit three different highly ordered phases, intercalated lamellar, doubly intercalated lamellar, and centered rectangular phases, depending on particle curvature and electrostatic interactions. The new phase diagram can be used to understand and design new highly ordered self-assemblies of 1D nanoparticles in soft matter, which provide new functionalities.
