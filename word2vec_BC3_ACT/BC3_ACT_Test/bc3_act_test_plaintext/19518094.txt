Photoacid for extremely long-lived and reversible pH-jumps.

RM Nunes, M Pineiro, LG Arnaut

The ability to change the acidity of an aqueous solution within the time of a short laser pulse and use the resulting low pH to drive acid-catalyzed reactions in the irradiated volume opens news perspectives for the spatial and temporal control of a variety of processes. Persistent and reversible acidification of an aqueous solution is achieved with a new molecule, 1-(2-nitroethyl)-2-naphthol, that combines the fast photoacid properties of an aromatic alcohol with the slow proton transfer rates of a nitroalkane. The protons released in a few nanoseconds by pulsed laser excitation of the photoacid last for nearly one second in aqueous solutions. We show that acid-base equilibria with other species is established at the lower pHs of the irradiated volume, that the process is reversible and that it can be maintained under continuous irradiation.
