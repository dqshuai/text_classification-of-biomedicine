Plant oxylipins: COI1/JAZs/MYC2 as the core jasmonic acid-signalling module.

A Chini, M Boter, R Solano

Jasmonic acid (JA) and its derivates, collectively known as jasmonates (JAs), are essential signalling molecules that coordinate the plant response to biotic and abiotic challenges, in addition to several developmental processes. The COI1 F-box and additional SCF modulators have long been known to have a crucial role in the JA-signalling pathway. Downstream JA-dependent transcriptional re-programming is regulated by a cascade of transcription factors and MYC2 plays a major role. Recently, JAZ family proteins have been identified as COI1 targets and repressors of MYC2, defining the 'missing link' in JA signalling. JA-Ile has been proposed to be the active form of the hormone, and COI1 is an essential component of the receptor complex. These recent discoveries have defined the core JA-signalling pathway as the module COI1/JAZs/MYC2.
