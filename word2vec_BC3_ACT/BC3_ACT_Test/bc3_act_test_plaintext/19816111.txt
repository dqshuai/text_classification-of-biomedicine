Roles of DLT in fine modulation on brassinosteroid response in rice.

H Tong, C Chu

Accumulated evidences suggest that brassinosteroid (BR) response is fine-tuned by multiple strategies. Recently, a GRAS protein, DLT, was identified to be involved in rice BR signaling. Transcription analysis of most known BR-related genes, including biosynthetic genes, signaling genes and also several downstream BR responsive genes, reveals DLT has extensive effects on BR-related genes expression, indicating its important role in modulating BR response. By promoter and protein sequence analysis, a complicated and subtle network was proposed that DLT may be involved in fine-modulating BR response at both transcriptional and protein levels. This provides new insights into BR signaling pathway and also gives a clear direction for the future work.
