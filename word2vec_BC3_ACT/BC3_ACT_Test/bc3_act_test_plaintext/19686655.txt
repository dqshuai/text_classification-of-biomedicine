Surfactants with fluorinated and hemifluorinated alkyl chains have yielded encouraging results in terms of membrane protein stability; however, the molecules used hitherto have either been chemically heterogeneous or formed heterogeneous micelles. A new series of surfactants whose polar head size is modulated by the presence of one, two, or three glucose moieties has been synthesized. Analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle neutron scattering show that fluorinated surfactants whose polar head bears a single glucosyl group form very large cylindrical micelles, whereas those with two or three glucose moieties form small, homogeneous, globular micelles. We studied the homogeneity and stability of the complexes formed between membrane proteins and these surfactants by using bacteriorhodopsin and cytochrome b(6)f as models. Homogeneous complexes were obtained only with surfactants that form homogeneous micelles. Surfactants bearing one or two glucose moieties were found to be stabilizing, whereas those with three moieties were destabilizing. Fluorinated and hemifluorinated surfactants with a two-glucose polar head thus appear to be very promising molecules for biochemical applications and structural studies. They were successfully used for cell-free synthesis of the ion channel MscL.
