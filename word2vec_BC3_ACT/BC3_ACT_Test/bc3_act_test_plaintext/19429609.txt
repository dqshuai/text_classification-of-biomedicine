Uptake of glycerol-2-phosphate via the ugp-encoded transporter in Escherichia coli K-12.

K Yang, M Wang, WW Metcalf

During phenotypic characterization of various Escherichia coli mutants, we observed that DeltaphoA strains are capable of using glycerol-2-phosphate (G2P) as a sole source of phosphorus. Mutations in the ugpBAECQ operon eliminated this phenotype, suggesting that G2P is a previously unrecognized substrate for the binding protein-dependent Ugp transporter.
