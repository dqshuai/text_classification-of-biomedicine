Chemokine receptors in T-cell-mediated diseases of the skin.

AS Lonsdorf, ST Hwang, AH Enk

The chemokine/chemokine receptor network is an integral element of the complex system of homeostasis and immunosurveillance. Initially studied because of their role in coordinating tissue-specific migration and activation of leucocytes, chemokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various malignancies and diseases with strong inflammatory components. We discuss recent findings suggesting a critical involvement of chemokine receptor interactions in the immunopathogenesis of classical inflammatory skin disorders such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, as well as neoplastic diseases with a T-cell origin, such as mycosis fungoides. A deeper understanding of the underlying contribution of the chemokine network in the disease processes is key for the development of selective targeted immunotherapeutics that may meet the delicate balance between efficacy and safety.
