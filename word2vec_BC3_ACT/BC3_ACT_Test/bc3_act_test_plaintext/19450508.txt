Keeping the beat in the rising heat.

DM Virshup, DB Forger

Circadian clocks use temperature compensation to keep accurate time over a range of temperatures, thus allowing reliable timekeeping under diverse environmental conditions. Mehra et al. (2009) and Baker et al. (2009) now show that phosphorylation-regulated protein degradation plays a key role in circadian temperature compensation.
