Complex lipid requirements for SNARE- and SNARE chaperone-dependent membrane fusion.

J Mima, W Wickner

Membrane fusion without lysis has been reconstituted with purified yeast vacuolar SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors), the SNARE chaperones Sec17p/Sec18p and the multifunctional HOPS complex, which includes a subunit of the SNARE-interactive Sec1-Munc18 family, and vacuolar lipids: phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidic acid (PA), cardiolipin (CL), ergosterol (ERG), diacylglycerol (DAG), and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). We now report that many of these lipids are required for rapid and efficient fusion of the reconstituted SNARE proteoliposomes in the presence of SNARE chaperones. Omission of either PE, PA, or PI3P from the complete set of lipids strongly reduces fusion, and PC, PE, PA, and PI3P constitute a minimal set of lipids for fusion. PA could neither be replaced by other lipids with small headgroups such as DAG or ERG nor by the acidic lipids PS or PI. PA is needed for full association of HOPS and Sec18p with proteoliposomes having a minimal set of lipids. Strikingly, PA and PE are as essential for SNARE complex assembly as for fusion, suggesting that these lipids facilitate functional interactions among SNAREs and SNARE chaperones.
