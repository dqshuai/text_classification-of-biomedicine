Development of androgen receptor antagonists with promising activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer.

HC Shen, SP Balk

Androgen receptor (AR) continues to play a central role in prostate cancers that relapse after androgen deprivation therapy, but these tumors are refractory to available AR antagonists. In a recent issue of Science, Tran et al. describe an antagonist that prevents AR recruitment to chromatin and shows efficacy in relapsed prostate cancer.
