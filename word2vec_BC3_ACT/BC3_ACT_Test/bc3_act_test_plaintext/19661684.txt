The health promoting effects of a grapevine-shoot extract named Vineatrol30, which contains resveratrol (Resv) as well as considerable amounts of Resv oligomers, have recently been investigated. In the present study, we analyzed the free radical scavenging capacity, the ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation, and the capacity to enhance the human glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx) and the human superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD) gene promoter activities of Vineatrol30. Vineatrol30 was able to scavenge the 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical cation and led to concentration-dependent inhibition of lipid peroxidation, Vineatrol30 not being superior to Resv alone in both cases. Vineatrol30 also enhanced the gene promoter activities of human GPx and SOD expressed in V79 cells, whereas this effect could not be demonstrated for Resv. In summary, the results presented in this study show that the Vineatrol30 grapevine-shoot extract is a free radical scavenger and potent antioxidant at non-cytotoxic concentrations.
