Metastatic disease from cutaneous melanoma can affect all organs of the body, and varies in its biological behavior and clinical presentation. We present the case of a 58-year-old man who arrived at our clinic with acute abdominal pain, which, after investigation, was diagnosed as acute cholecystitis. The patient underwent laparotomy and cholecystectomy. Two years ago, he underwent surgical removal of a primary cutaneous melanoma on his right upper back. Pathological examination revealed the presence of malignant melanoma with a metastatic lesion of the gallbladder.
