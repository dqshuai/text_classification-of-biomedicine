N-glycans modulate the activation of gp130 in mouse embryonic neural precursor cells.

M Yanagisawa, RK Yu

gp130 is a ubiquitously expressed glycoprotein and signal transducer of interleukin 6 family of cytokines. It has been reported that gp130 has 11 potential N-glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain, and nine of them are actually N-glycosylated. However, the structure and functional role of the carbohydrate chains carried by gp130 are totally unknown. In this study, we examined the functional role of N-glycans of gp130 in mouse neuroepithelial cells. In neuroepithelial cells treated with tunicamycin, an N-glycosylation inhibitor, unglycosylated form of gp130 was detected. The unglycosylated gp130 was not phosphorylated in response to leukemia inhibitory factor stimulation. Although the unglycosylated gp130 was found to be expressed on the cell surface, it could not form a heterodimer with leukemia inhibitory factor receptor. These results suggest that N-glycans are required for the activation, but not for the localization, of gp130 in neuroepithelial cells.
