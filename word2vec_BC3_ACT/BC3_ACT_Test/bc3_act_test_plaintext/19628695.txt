Connexin 43 as a signaling platform for increasing the volume and spatial distribution of regenerated tissue.

Gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) is ubiquitous in the majority of vertebrate cells and is required for the proper development of most tissues. The loss of gap junction-mediated cell-to-cell communication leads to compromised development in many tissues and organs. Because cells constantly interact through gap junctions to coordinate tissue functions and homeostasis, we hypothesized that increasing cell-to-cell communication, via genetically engineering cells to overexpress gap junction proteins, could enhance cell differentiation in the interior regions of 3D tissue equivalents, thereby increasing the ability to regenerate larger and more uniform volumes of tissue. To test this hypothesis, we used bone as a model tissue because of the difficulty in achieving spatially uniform bone regeneration in 3D. In bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), GJIC and osteogenic differentiation were compromised in 3D cultures relative to 2D monolayers and in the core of 3D cultures relative to the surface. Overexpression of connexin 43 (Cx43) via transduction of BMSCs with a lentivirus overcame this problem, enhancing both the magnitude and spatial distribution of GJIC and osteogenic differentiation markers throughout 3D constructs. Transplantation of cells overexpressing Cx43 resulted in an increased volume fraction and spatial uniformity of bone in vivo, relative to nontransduced BMSCs. Increased GJIC also enhanced the effect of a potent osteoinductive agent (BMP-7), suggesting a synergism between the soluble factor and GJIC. These findings present a platform to improve cell-to-cell communication in 3D and to achieve uniformly distributed tissue regeneration in 3D.
