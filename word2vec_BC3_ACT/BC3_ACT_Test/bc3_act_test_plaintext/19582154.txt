BACKGROUND: Non adherent bone marrow derived cells (NA-BMCs) have recently been described to give rise to multiple mesenchymal phenotypes and have an impact in tissue regeneration. Therefore, the effects of murine bone marrow derived NA-BMCs were investigated with regard to engraftment capacities in allogeneic and syngeneic stem cell transplantation using transgenic, human CD4(+), murine CD4(-/-), HLA-DR3(+) mice. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Bone marrow cells were harvested from C57Bl/6 and Balb/c wild-type mice, expanded to NA-BMCs for 4 days and characterized by flow cytometry before transplantation in lethally irradiated recipient mice. Chimerism was detected using flow cytometry for MHC-I (H-2D[b], H-2K[d]), mu/huCD4, and huHLA-DR3). Culturing of bone marrow cells in a dexamethasone containing DMEM medium induced expansion of non adherent cells expressing CD11b, CD45, and CD90. Analysis of the CD45(+) showed depletion of CD4(+), CD8(+), CD19(+), and CD117(+) cells. Expanded syngeneic and allogeneic NA-BMCs were transplanted into triple transgenic mice. Syngeneic NA-BMCs protected 83% of mice from death (n = 8, CD4(+) donor chimerism of 5.8+/-2.4% [day 40], P<.001). Allogeneic NA-BMCs preserved 62.5% (n = 8) of mice from death without detectable hematopoietic donor chimerism. Transplantation of syngeneic bone marrow cells preserved 100%, transplantation of allogeneic bone marrow cells 33% of mice from death. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: NA-BMCs triggered endogenous hematopoiesis and induced faster recovery compared to bone marrow controls. These findings may be of relevance in the refinement of strategies in the treatment of hematological malignancies.
