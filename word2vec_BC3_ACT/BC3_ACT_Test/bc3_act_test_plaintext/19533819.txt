Laparoscopic resection of an adrenal pseudocyst mimicking a retroperitoneal mucinous cystic neoplasm.

BS Kim, SH Joo, SI Choi, JY Song

Adrenal pseudocysts are rare cystic masses that arise within the adrenal gland and are usually non-functional and asymptomatic. Adrenal pseudocysts consist of a fibrous wall without a cellular lining. We report a patient with a 9 cm, left-sided suprarenal cystic mass who presented with abdominal discomfort of 2 years' duration. A 38-year-old woman was referred to our service for evaluation of abdominal discomfort and gastrointestinal symptoms. Routine laboratory tests were within normal limits. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed a 9 cm x 8 cm x 8 cm well-defined cystic lesion displacing the left kidney. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic lesion with low signal intensity on the T1-weighted image and high signal intensity on the T2-weighted image. A laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed to diagnose the lesion. The final pathology showed an adrenal pseudocyst without a cellular lining. The patient had no postoperative complications and she was discharged four days after surgery.
