ZO-1 and the spatial organization of gap junctions and glutamate receptors in the outer plexiform layer of the mammalian retina.

Information processing in the retina starts at the first synaptic layer, where photoreceptors and second-order neurons exhibit a complex architecture of glutamatergic and electrical synapses. To investigate the composition of this highly organized synaptic network, we determined the spatial relationship of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) with different connexins (Cx) and glutamate receptor (GluR) subunits in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) of rabbit, mouse, and monkey retinas. ZO-1 is well known as an intracellular component of tight and adherens junctions, but also interacts with various connexins at gap junctions. We found ZO-1 closely associated with Cx50 on dendrites of A-type horizontal cells in rabbit, and with Cx57 at dendro-dendritic gap junctions of mouse horizontal cells. The spatial arrangement of ZO-1 at the giant gap-junctional plaques in rabbit was particularly striking. ZO-1 formed a clear margin around the large Cx50 plaques instead of being colocalized with the connexin staining. Our finding suggests the involvement of ZO-1 in the composition of tight or adherens junctions around gap-junctional plaques instead of interacting with connexins directly. Furthermore, gap junctions were found to be clustered in close proximity to GluRs at the level of desmosome-like junctions, where horizontal cell dendrites converge before invaginating the cone pedicle. Based on this distinct spatial organization of gap junctions and GluRs, it is tempting to speculate that glutamate released from the photoreceptors may play a role in modulating the conductance of electrical synapses in the OPL.
