Deoxypodophyllotoxin induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HeLa cells.

The natural flavolignan deoxypodophyllotoxin (DPPT) inhibits tubulin polymerization and induces cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M, followed by apoptosis. However, the precise mechanism of DPPT action is currently unknown. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which DPPT treatment of HeLa cervical carcinoma cells induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We show that DPPT treatment inhibits cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and that this reduction in cell viability results from cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase, accompanied by an increase in apoptotic cell death. The induction of apoptosis by DPPT was confirmed by visualization of morphologic changes and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. In addition, DPPT causes p53 and Bax to accumulate, accompanied by activation of DNA damage-sensing kinases, including ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase and Chk2. Furthermore, DPPT activates caspase-3 and -7, suggesting that caspase-mediated pathways are involved in DPPT-induced apoptosis. Levels of the tumor suppressor PTEN were up-regulated during DPPT treatment, coincident with Akt inhibition. Together, these data suggest that DPPT induces G(2)/M cell-cycle arrest followed by apoptosis through multiple cellular processes, involving the activation of ATM, upregulation of p53 and Bax, activation of caspase-3 and -7, and accumulation of PTEN resulting in the inhibition of the Akt pathway.
