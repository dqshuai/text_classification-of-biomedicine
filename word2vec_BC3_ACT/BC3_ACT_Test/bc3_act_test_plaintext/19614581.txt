One of the principal problems facing nucleic acid delivery systems using polyplexes is the instability of the complexes in the presence of proteins and high salt concentrations. We have used a cross-linking polymer to overcome this problem. Pendant thiol moieties have been incorporated into a PAA (polyamidoamine) homopolymer and a PEG [poly(ethylene glycol)]-PAA-PEG copolymer reported previously as a self-assembling system. When mixed with DNA, small monodisperse sterically stabilized particles are formed in quantitative yields. Optimization of the formulation resulted in nanoparticles which are stable in seawater. This cross-linked formulation has been successfully tested in both freshwater and estuarine field trials as a water tracer. Future work will develop these particles as a groundwater tracer and also for therapeutic applications of nucleic acid delivery.
