We designed a high-density mouse genotyping array containing 623,124 single-nucleotide polymorphisms that captures the known genetic variation present in the laboratory mouse. The array also contains 916,269 invariant genomic probes targeted to functional elements and regions known to harbor segmental duplications. The array opens the door to the characterization of genetic diversity, copy-number variation, allele-specific gene expression and DNA methylation, and will extend the successes of human genome-wide association studies to the mouse.
