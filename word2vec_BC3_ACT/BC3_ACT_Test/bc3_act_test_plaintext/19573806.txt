Actin-based protrusions: promoters or inhibitors of cancer invasion?

LM Machesky, HR Tang

In a recent issue of Cell, Silva and colleagues reported the identification of CYFIP1, a member of the actin-assembly-promoting Scar/WAVE complex, as an invasion suppressor in epithelial cancers. This study challenges ideas about the role of actin in cancer invasion.
