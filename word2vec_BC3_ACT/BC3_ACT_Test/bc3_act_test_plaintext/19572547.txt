A novel series of potent dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitors based on a 9-(arenethenyl)purine core has been identified. Unlike traditional dual Src/Abl inhibitors targeting the active enzyme conformation, these inhibitors bind to the inactive, DFG-out conformation of both kinases. Extensive SAR studies led to the discovery of potent and orally bioavailable inhibitors, some of which demonstrated in vivo efficacy. Once-daily oral administration of inhibitor 9i (AP24226) significantly prolonged the survival of mice injected intravenously with wild type Bcr-Abl expressing Ba/F3 cells at a dose of 10 mg/kg. In a separate model, oral administration of 9i to mice bearing subcutaneous xenografts of Src Y527F expressing NIH 3T3 cells elicited dose-dependent tumor shrinkage with complete tumor regression observed at the highest dose. Notably, several inhibitors (e.g., 14a, AP24163) exhibited modest cellular potency (IC50 = 300-400 nM) against the Bcr-Abl mutant T315I, a variant resistant to all currently marketed therapies for chronic myeloid leukemia.
