DNA damage signalling recruits RREB-1 to the p53 tumour suppressor promoter.

Transcriptional regulation of the p53 tumour suppressor gene plays an important role in the control of the expression of various target genes involved in the DNA damage response. However, the molecular basis of this regulation remains obscure. In the present study we demonstrate that RREB-1 (Ras-responsive-element-binding protein-1) efficiently binds to the p53 promoter via the p53 core promoter element and transactivates p53 expression. Silencing of RREB-1 significantly reduces p53 expression at both the mRNA and the protein levels. Notably, disruption of RREB-1-mediated p53 transcription suppresses the expression of the p53 target genes. We also show that, upon exposure to genotoxic stress, RREB-1 controls apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. These findings provide evidence that RREB-1 participates in modulating p53 transcription in response to DNA damage.
