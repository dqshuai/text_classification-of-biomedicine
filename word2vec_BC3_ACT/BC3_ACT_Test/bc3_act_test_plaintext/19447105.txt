Apigenin inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer A2780 cells through Id1.

Apigenin, a common dietary flavonoid, has been shown to possess anti-tumor properties. However, the mechanism by which apigenin inhibits cancer cells is not fully understood. Id1 (inhibitor of differentiation or DNA binding protein 1) contributes to tumorigenesis by stimulating cell proliferation, inhibiting cell differentiation and facilitating tumor neoangiogenesis. Elevated Id1 is found in ovarian cancers and its level correlates with the malignant potential of ovarian tumors. Therefore, Id1 is a potential target for ovarian cancer treatment. Here, we demonstrate that apigenin inhibits proliferation and tumorigenesis of human ovarian cancer A2780 cells through Id1. Apigenin suppressed the expression of Id1 through activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). Our results may elucidate a new mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of apigenin on cancer cells.
