Genesis of anisotropic colloidal particles via protrusion of polystyrene from polyelectrolyte multilayer encapsulation.

HK Yu, Z Mao, D Wang

Incubation of polyelectrolyte multilayer coated polystyrene particles in a mixture of water and tetrahydrofuran leads to rapid protrusion of the polystyrene through the polyelectrolyte coating and thus to formation of anisotropic particles, which is independent of the polystyrene core size and the polyelectrolyte coating composition.
