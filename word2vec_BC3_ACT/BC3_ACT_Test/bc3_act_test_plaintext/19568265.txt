A reader for centromeric chromatin.

N Sekulic, BE Black

For nucleosome-encoded epigenetic information to be transmitted, an epigenetic mark requires a 'reader' for its physical recognition. CENP-N has now been identified as a reader of the centromere-specifying epigenetic mark that is generated by incorporation of the histone H3 variant CENP-A into centromeric nucleosomes.
