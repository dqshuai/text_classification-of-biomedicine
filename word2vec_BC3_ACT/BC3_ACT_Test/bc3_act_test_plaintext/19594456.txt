A device for automated hydrodynamic shearing of genomic DNA.

A Joneja, X Huang

We describe a device for automated fragmentation of genomic DNA by hydrodynamic shearing using a filter screen with uniform pores. Human genomic DNA can be fragmented reproducibly to a range of 2000-12,000 bp by using various fluid flow rates and screens with 0.5-10-microm pores. The utilization of disposable screens eliminates sample cross-contamination and the tendency of device clogging, commonly encountered in single-orifice shearing devices.
