A receptor for eating mitochondria.

N Ishihara, N Mizushima

Mitochondria play central roles in cell survival by producing energy, and in cell death by regulating apoptosis. Conversely, the life and death of mitochondria, including growth, fission, and autophagic degradation, is controlled by the host cell. Using yeast genetics, a mitochondrial surface receptor involved in mitochondrial autophagy has recently been identified.
