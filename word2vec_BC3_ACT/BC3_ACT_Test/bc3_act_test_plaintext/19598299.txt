AIM: To investigate the possible protective effects of carnosol on liver injury induced by intestinal ischemia reperfusion (I/R). METHODS: Rats were divided randomly into three experimental groups: sham, intestinal I/R and carnosol treatment (n = 18 each). The intestinal I/R model was established by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 1 h. In the carnosol treatment group, surgery was performed as in the intestinal I/R group, with intraperitoneal administration of 3 mg/kg carnosol 1 h before the operation. At 2, 4 and 6 h after reperfusion, rats were killed and blood, intestine and liver tissue samples were obtained. Intestine and liver histology was investigated. Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and interleukin (IL)-6 were measured. Liver tissue superoxide dismutase (SOD) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were assayed. The liver intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) were determined by immunohistochemical analysis and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Intestinal I/R induced intestine and liver injury, characterized by histological changes, as well as a significant increase in serum AST and ALT levels. The activity of SOD in the liver tissue decreased after I/R, which was enhanced by carnosol pretreatment. In addition, compared with the control group, carnosol markedly reduced liver tissue MPO activity and serum IL-6 level, which was in parallel with the decreased level of liver ICAM-1 and NF-kappaB expression. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that carnosol pretreatment attenuates liver injury induced by intestinal I/R, attributable to the antioxidant effect and inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway.
