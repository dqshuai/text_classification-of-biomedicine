Square tetrapalladium sheet sandwich complexes: cyclononatetraenyl as a versatile face-capping ligand.

T Murahashi, R Inoue, K Usui, S Ogoshi

An unusual square tetrapalladium sheet sandwich complex, [Pd(4)(mu(4)-C(9)H(9))(mu(4)-C(8)H(8))][B(Ar(f))(4)] has been isolated and structurally characterized. X-ray structure analysis showed that the square palladium sheet is flanked by the nine-membered cyclononatetraenyl and eight-membered cyclooctatetraene ligands to form a square metal sheet molecular sandwich structure. The coordinative unsaturation of the complex was revealed by phosphine titration experiments.
