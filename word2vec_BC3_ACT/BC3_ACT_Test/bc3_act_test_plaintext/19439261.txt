Multisensory integration: frequency tuning of audio-tactile integration.

JJ Foxe

Multisensory information can be crucial, yet in many circumstances we have little, if any, awareness of the effects of multisensory inputs on what appear to be entirely unisensory perceptions. A recent study shows robust effects of auditory input on tactile frequency discriminations and that this auditory cross-sensory interference has specific tuning.
