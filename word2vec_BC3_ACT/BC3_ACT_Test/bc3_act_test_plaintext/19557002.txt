Coiled-coil interactions are required for post-Golgi R-SNARE trafficking.

The sorting of post-Golgi R-SNAREs (vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8) is still poorly understood. To address this, we developed a system to investigate their localization, trafficking and cell-surface levels. Here, we show that the distribution and internalization of VAMPs 3 and 8 are determined solely through a new conserved mechanism that uses coiled-coil interactions, and that VAMP4 does not require these interactions for its trafficking. We propose that VAMPs 3 and 8 are trafficked while in a complex with Q-SNAREs. We also show that the dileucine motif of VAMP4 is required for both its internalization and retrieval to the trans-Golgi network. However, when the dileucine motif is mutated, the construct can still be internalized potentially through coiled-coil interactions with Q-SNAREs.
