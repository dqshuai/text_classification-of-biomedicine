Rhizospheric NO interacts with the acquisition of reduced N sources by the roots of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.).

The gas phase of the soil plays an important role in plant growth and development. We investigated the effect of rhizospheric NO as a signalling compound for N uptake of beech roots. Following exposure to NO, ammonium and glutamine uptake into roots were determined using (15)N-labelling, and gene expression of selected transporters was analysed by quantitative real-time PCR. Uptake of both N sources increased significantly with elevated NO concentration. However, with one exception, this increase was not reflected in up-regulation of expression of the respective transporters.
