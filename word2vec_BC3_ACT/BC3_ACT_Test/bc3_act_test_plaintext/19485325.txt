Development of a new heterobimetallic Ga(O-iPr)(3)/Yb(OTf)(3)/Schiff base 2d complex for catalytic asymmetric alpha-additions of isocyanides to aldehydes is described. Schiff base 2d derived from o-vanillin was suitable to utilize cationic rare earth metal triflates with good Lewis acidity in bimetallic Schiff base catalysis. The Ga(O-iPr)(3)/Yb(OTf)(3)/Schiff base 2d complex promoted asymmetric alpha-additions of alpha-isocyanoacetamides to aryl, heteroaryl, alkenyl, and alkyl aldehydes in good to excellent enantioselectivity (88-98% ee).
