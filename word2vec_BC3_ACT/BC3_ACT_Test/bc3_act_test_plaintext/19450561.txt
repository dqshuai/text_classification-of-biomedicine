In the current study, we examined the function of N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) expression in breast cancer cells, especially focusing on the role of bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) induced by NDRG2. NDRG2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited the mRNA expression of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9. Interestingly, a specific induction of active BMP-4 was exclusively observed in MDA-MB-231-NDRG2 cells but not in MDA-MB-231-mock cells. Neutralization of BMP-4 in MDA-MB-231-NDRG2 cells resulted in the rescue of MMP-9 mRNA expression and migration capacity. In addition, treatment with recombinant BMP-4 dramatically suppressed MMP-9 mRNA expression, gelatinolytic MMP-9 activity, migration, and invasion capacity both in MDA-MB-231 and PMA-treated MCF-7 cells. Collectively, our data show that BMP-4 induced by NDRG2 expression inhibits the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells, especially via suppression of MMP-9 activity.
