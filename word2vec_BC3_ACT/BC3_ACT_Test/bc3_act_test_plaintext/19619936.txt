The study investigated the effects of the dopamine-somatostatin chimeric compound BIM-23A760 on cell proliferation and apoptosis in cultured cells from human non-functioning pituitary tumors (NFPTs). Both BIM-23A760 and the dopaminergic agonist BIM-53097 induced a significant inhibition of cell proliferation associated with increased p27 expression, together with a significant increase in caspase-3 activity. Conversely, null or marginal effects were elicited by somatostatin analogs. Moreover, BIM-23A760 and BIM-53097 induced ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation and the blockade of these pathways prevented both the antiproliferative and the pro-apoptotic effects of these drugs. In conclusions the chimeric compound BIM-23A760 is able to exert cytostatic and cytotoxic effects in NFPTs, these phenomena being mainly mediated by DR2D and involving ERK1/2 and p38 pathways activation.
