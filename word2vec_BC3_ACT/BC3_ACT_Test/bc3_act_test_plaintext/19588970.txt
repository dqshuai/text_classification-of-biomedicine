Synthesis of Cu-doped InP nanocrystals (d-dots) with ZnSe diffusion barrier as efficient and color-tunable NIR emitters.

R Xie, X Peng

Efficient Cu-doped InP quantum dots (Cu:InP d-dots) emitters were successfully synthesized by epitaxial growth of a ZnSe diffusion barrier for the dopants. The Cu dopant emission of the Cu:InP/ZnSe core/shell d-dots covered the important red and near-infrared (NIR) window for biomedical applicaitons, from 630 to 1100 nm, by varying the size of the InP host nanocrystals. These new d-dots emitters not only compensate for the emission wavelength of the existing noncadmium d-dots emitters, Cu- and Mn-doped ZnSe d-dots (450-610 nm), but also offer a complete series of efficient nanocrystal emitters based on InP nanocrystals. The one-pot synthetic scheme for the formation of Cu:InP/ZnSe core/shell d-dots was successfully established by systematically studying the doping process, the dopant concentration-dependent photophysical properties, and the dopant diffusion during shell epitaxy, etc. Complete elimination of InP bandgap emission and efficient pure dopant emission (with photoluminescence quantum yield as high as between 35-40%) of the core/shell d-dots were achieved by optimizing the final doping level and the diffusion barrier thickness.
