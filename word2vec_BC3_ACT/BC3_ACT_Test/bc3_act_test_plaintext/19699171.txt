MicroRNAs regulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) target genes that contribute to the inflammatory phenotype. Here, we showed that the protein kinase Akt1, which is activated by LPS, positively regulated miRNAs let-7e and miR-181c but negatively regulated miR-155 and miR-125b. In silico analyses and transfection studies revealed that let-7e repressed Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), whereas miR-155 repressed SOCS1, two proteins critical for LPS-driven TLR signaling, which regulate endotoxin sensitivity and tolerance. As a result, Akt1(-/-) macrophages exhibited increased responsiveness to LPS in culture and Akt1(-/-) mice did not develop endotoxin tolerance in vivo. Overexpression of let-7e and suppression of miR-155 in Akt1(-/-) macrophages restored sensitivity and tolerance to LPS in culture and in animals. These results indicate that Akt1 regulates the response of macrophages to LPS by controlling miRNA expression.
