Ars2 and the Cap-Binding Complex Team up for Silencing.

AF Nielsen, J Gloggnitzer, J Martinez

In this issue, Sabin et al. (2009) and Gruber et al. (2009) reveal the protein Ars2 as a versatile regulator of RNA silencing. They show that Ars2 stimulates microRNA processing, contributes to antiviral resistance in flies, and is important for cell proliferation in mammals.
