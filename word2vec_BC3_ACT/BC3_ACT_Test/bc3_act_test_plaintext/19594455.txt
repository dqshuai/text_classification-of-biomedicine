Mouse embryo cryopreservation utilizing a novel high-capacity vitrification spatula.

WH Tsang, KL Chow

Embryo cryopreservation is an indispensable technique in reproductive programs and in animal facilities where genetically modified mice are used extensively. Here we report the use of a vitrification spatula (VS) that can be readily homemade and has a large holding capacity to vitrify preimplantation mammalian embryos in a micro-drop employing ultra-rapid cooling in liquid nitrogen (LN2). Vitrified one-cell embryos and morulae have high survival rates after thawing, and the fertility of the derived progeny is comparable to that of the control unvitrified group. The large holding capacity (up to 50 embryos per VS) does not only allow rapid expansion of storage capacity for additional mouse strains but also opens up the possibility to streamline transgenic mice generation procedures in transgenic facilities.
