Amorphous indium tin oxide (ITO)-based thin-film transistors (TFTs) were fabricated on various dielectrics [SiO(2) and self-assembled nanodielectrics (SANDs)] by spin-coating an ITO film precursor solution consisting of InCl(3) and SnCl(4) as the sources of In(3+) and Sn(4+), respectively, methoxyethanol (solvent), and ethanolamine (base). These films can be annealed at temperatures T(a) < or = 250 degrees C and afford devices with excellent electrical characteristics. The optimized [In(3+)]/[In(3+) + Sn(4+)] molar ratio (0.7) and annealing temperature (T(a) = 250 degrees C) afford TFTs exhibiting electron mobilities of approximately 2 and approximately 10-20 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) with SiO(2) and SAND, respectively, as the gate dielectric. Remarkably, ITO TFTs processed at 220 degrees C still exhibit electron mobilities of >0.2 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1), which is encouraging for processing on plastic substrates.
