Stress proteins such as heat shock proteins (Hsps) are up-regulated in cells in response to various forms of stress, like thermal and oxidative stress and inflammation. Hsps prevent cellular damage and increase immunoregulation by the activation of anti-inflammatory T-cells. Decreased capacity for stress-induced Hsp expression is associated with immune disorders. Thus, therapeutic boosting Hsp expression might restore or enhance cellular stress resistance and immunoregulation. Especially food- or herb-derived phytonutrients may be attractive compounds to restore optimal Hsp expression in response to stress. In the present study, we explored three readout systems to monitor Hsp70 expression in a manner relevant for the immune system and evaluated novel Hsp co-inducers. First, intracellular staining and analysis by flow cytometry was used to detect stress and/or dietary compound induced Hsp70 expression in multiple rodent cell types efficiently. This system was used to screen a panel of food-derived extracts with potent anti-oxidant capacity. This strategy yielded the identity of several new enhancers of stress-induced Hsp70 expression, among them carvacrol, found in thyme and oregano. Second, CD4(+) T-cell hybridomas were generated that specifically recognized an immunodominant Hsp70 peptide. These hybridomas were used to show that carvacrol enhanced Hsp70 levels increased T-cell activation. Third, we generated a DNAJB1-luc-O23 reporter cell line to show that carvacrol increased the transcriptional activation of a heat shock promoter in the presence of arsenite. These assay systems are generally applicable to identify compounds that affect the Hsp level in cells of the immune system.
