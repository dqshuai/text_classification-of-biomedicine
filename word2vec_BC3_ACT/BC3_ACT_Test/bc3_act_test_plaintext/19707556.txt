IkappaBzeta is a novel member of the IkappaB family of NFkappaB regulators, which modulates NFkappaB activity in the nucleus, rather than controlling its nuclear translocation. IkappaBzeta is specifically induced by IL-1beta and several TLR ligands and positively regulates NFkappaB-mediated transcription of genes such as IL-6 and NGAL as an NFkappaB binding co-factor. We recently reported that the IL-1 family cytokines, IL-1beta and IL-18, strongly synergize with TNFalpha for IFNgamma production in KG-1 cells, whereas the same cytokines alone have minimal effects on IFNgamma production. Given the striking similarities between the IL-1R and IL-18R signaling pathways we hypothesized that a common signaling event or gene product downstream of these receptors is responsible for the observed synergy. We investigated IkappaBzeta protein expression in KG-1 cells upon stimulation with IL-1beta, IL-18 and TNFalpha. Our results demonstrated that IL-18, as well as IL-1beta, induced moderate IkappaBzeta expression in KG-1 cells. However, TNFalpha synergized with IL-1beta and IL-18, whereas by itself it had a minimal effect on IkappaBzeta expression. NFkappaB inhibition resulted in decreased IL-1beta/IL-18/TNFalpha-stimulated IFNgamma release. Moreover, silencing of IkappaBzeta expression led to a specific decrease in IFNgamma production. Overall, our data suggests that IkappaBzeta positively regulates NFkappaB-mediated IFNgamma production in KG-1 cells.
