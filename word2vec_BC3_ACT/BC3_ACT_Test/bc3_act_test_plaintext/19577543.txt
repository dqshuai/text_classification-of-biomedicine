CMTM5 induces apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells and has synergistic effects with TNF-alpha.

Our previous data show that CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing member 5 (CMTM5) is a potential tumor suppressor gene, but its function in pancreatic cancer is unknown. Herein we first report that CMTM5 is also absent in pancreatic cancer cell lines with promoter methylation. Compared with normal pancreatic tissues, CMTM5 is significantly decreased in cancer tissues. Restoration of CMTM5-v1 not only induces MIA PaCa-2 cell apoptosis with activation of caspase 3, 8 and 9, but also has synergistic effects with TNF-alpha. Thus, CMTM5 may play a role in the pancreatic cancer.
