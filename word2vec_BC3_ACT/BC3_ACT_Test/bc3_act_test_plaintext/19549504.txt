Reconstitution of blue fluorescent protein from recombinant apoaequorin and synthetic coelenteramide.

S Inouye, T Hosoya

Blue fluorescent protein of aequorin (BFP) is a complex of Ca(2+)-bound apoaequorin with coelenteramide and is a bifunctional protein, which shows blue fluorescence and the luminescence activity like a luciferase. To reconstitute synthetic BFP (syn-BFP) from apoaequorin and coelenteramide, we established new synthetic route of coelenteramide and prepared highly purified recombinant aequorin using the histidine-tagged secretion system in Escherichia coli cells. As a result, we succeeded in reconstituting syn-BFP quantitatively and the fluorescence and luminescence properties of syn-BFP were identical to that of BFP obtained from aequorin.
