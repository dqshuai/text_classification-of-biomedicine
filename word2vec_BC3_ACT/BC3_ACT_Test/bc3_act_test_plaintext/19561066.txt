Direct interdomain interactions can mediate allosterism in the thyroid receptor.

BD Putcha, EJ Fernandez

The thyroid (TR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR) belong to the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of ligand-mediated transcription factors. At the molecular level, TR activity is specifically modulated by interactions with the ligand 3,3',5 triiodo-l-thyronine (T3), RXR, DNA, and co-activators such as SRC1, occurring in concert or sequentially. Although binding sites for DNA and coregulators such as SRC1 are distinct and at distal regions of these receptors, cell-based and EMSA studies have suggested that these molecules can regulate binding of each other to the receptor. We present evidence of direct, DNA-dependent, communication between the DNA and ligand binding domains (DBD and LBD) that can allosterically regulate interactions with SRC1 and DNA, respectively, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and cell-based assays. Additionally, we note that interdomain communication is affected by RXR in RXR:TR. We also noticed a DNA-dependent cross-talk between RXR and TR within RXR:TR. Finally, we suggest that differences in transactivation on different TRE may be the consequence of different affinities between TRE and RXR:TR.
