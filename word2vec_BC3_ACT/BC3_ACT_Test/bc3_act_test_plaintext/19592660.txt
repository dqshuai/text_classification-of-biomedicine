Naturally occurring Foxp3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells isolated from lungs of naive mice regulate lung allergic airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation, levels of Th2 cytokines, and mucus production. OVA-specific (alphabetaTCR(+)) CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells suppressed ragweed-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation as did anti-TCR-treated OVA-specific CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells, suggesting that Ag-specificity was not required for expression of regulatory activities. Suppression was associated with increased levels of IL-10 and TGF-beta; decreased levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; and reduced recruitment and activation of CD8(+) T cells in the airways. Following intratracheal administration, OVA-specific CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells were identified in both the airway lumens and lung parenchyma, and in some instances in close proximity to host CD8(+) T cells. These results demonstrate that the regulatory activities of naturally occurring Foxp3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells on lung allergic responses are Ag-nonspecific and thus, independent of Ag-specific recognition.
