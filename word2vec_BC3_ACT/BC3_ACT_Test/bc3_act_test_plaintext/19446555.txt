Up-regulation of ZO-1 expression and barrier function in cultured human corneal epithelial cells by substance P.

JA Ko, R Yanai, T Nishida

The effects of the sensory neurotransmitter substance P on the expression of tight junction proteins and on barrier function in human corneal epithelial cells were investigated. The expression of ZO-1, but not that of occludin or claudin-1, was increased by substance P in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. This effect was inhibited by the NK-1 receptor antagonist GR82334 and by KN62, an inhibitor of Ca(2+)- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Substance P also increased the transepithelial electrical resistance of a cell monolayer in a manner sensitive to GR82334. Substance P may therefore play a role in maintenance of tight junctions in the corneal epithelium.
