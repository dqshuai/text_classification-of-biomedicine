Early steps in cell infection by parvoviruses: host-specific differences in cell receptor binding but similar endosomal trafficking.

Canine parvovirus (CPV) and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) are closely related parvoviruses that differ in their host ranges for cats and dogs. Both viruses bind their host transferrin receptor (TfR), enter cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and traffic with that receptor through endosomal pathways. Infection by these viruses appears to be inefficient and slow, with low numbers of virions infecting the cell after a number of hours. Species-specific binding to TfR controls viral host range, and in this study FPV and strains of CPV differed in the levels of cell attachment, uptake, and infection in canine and feline cells. During infection, CPV particles initially bound and trafficked passively on the filopodia of canine cells while they bound to the cell body of feline cells. That binding was associated with the TfR as it was disrupted by anti-TfR antibodies. Capsids were taken up from the cell surface with different kinetics in canine and feline cells but, unlike transferrin, most did not recycle. Capsids labeled with fluorescent markers were seen in Rab5-, Rab7-, or Rab11-positive endosomal compartments within minutes of uptake, but reached the nucleus. Constitutively active or dominant negative Rab mutants changed the intracellular distribution of capsids and affected the infectivity of virus in cells.
