Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) has many essential functions and its homeostasis is highly regulated. We previously found that hypertonic stress increases PIP(2) by selectively activating the beta isoform of the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5Kbeta) through Ser/Thr dephosphorylation and promoting its translocation to the plasma membrane. Here we report that hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) also induces PIP5Kbeta Ser/Thr dephosphorylation, but it has the opposite effect on PIP(2) homeostasis, PIP5Kbeta function, and the actin cytoskeleton. Brief H(2)O(2) treatments decrease cellular PIP(2) in a PIP5Kbeta-dependent manner. PIP5Kbeta is tyrosine phosphorylated, dissociates from the plasma membrane, and has decreased lipid kinase activity. In contrast, the other two PIP5K isoforms are not inhibited by H(2)O(2). We identified spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), which is activated by oxidants, as a candidate PIP5Kbeta kinase in this pathway, and mapped the oxidant-sensitive tyrosine phosphorylation site to residue 105. The PIP5KbetaY105E phosphomimetic is catalytically inactive and cytosolic, whereas the Y105F non-phosphorylatable mutant has higher intrinsic lipid kinase activity and is much more membrane associated than wild type PIP5Kbeta. These results suggest that during oxidative stress, as modeled by H(2)O(2) treatment, Syk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PIP5Kbeta is the dominant post-translational modification that is responsible for the decrease in cellular PIP(2).
