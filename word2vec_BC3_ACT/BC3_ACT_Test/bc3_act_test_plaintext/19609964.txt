Our goal was to identify the leaf proteomic changes which appeared during N remobilisation that were associated or not associated with senescence of oilseed rape in response to contrasting nitrate availability. Remobilisation of N and leaf senescence status were followed using (15)N tracing, patterns of chlorophyll level, total protein content and a molecular indicator based on expression of senescence-associated gene 12/Cab genes. Three phases associated with N remobilisation were distinguished. Proteomics revealed that 55 proteins involved in metabolism, energy, detoxification, stress response, proteolysis and protein folding, were significantly induced during N remobilisation. Four proteases were specifically identified. FtsH, a chloroplastic protease, was induced transiently during the early stages of N remobilisation. Considering the dynamics of N remobilisation, chlorophyll and protein content, the pattern of FtsH expression indicated that this protease could be involved in the degradation of chloroplastic proteins. Aspartic protease increased at the beginning of senescence and was maintained at a high level, implicating this protease in proteolysis during the course of leaf senescence. Two proteases, proteasome beta subunit A1 and senescence-associated gene 12, were induced and continued to increase during the later phase of senescence, suggesting that these proteases are more specifically involved in the proteolysis processes occurring at the final stages of leaf senescence.
