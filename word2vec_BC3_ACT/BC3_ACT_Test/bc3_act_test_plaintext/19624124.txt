Homodimerization and heterodimerization of minimal zinc(II)-binding-domain peptides of T-cell proteins CD4, CD8alpha, and Lck.

AM Davis, JM Berg

Metal-mediated protein oligomerization is an emerging mode of protein-protein interaction. The C-terminal cytosolic domains of T-cell coreceptors CD4 and CD8alpha form zinc-bridged heterodimers with the N-terminal region of the kinase Lck, with each protein contributing two cysteinate ligands to the complex. Using size exclusion chromatography, (1)H NMR, and UV/visible absorption spectroscopy with cobalt(II) as a spectroscopic probe, we demonstrate that small peptides derived from these regions form metal-bridged heterodimers but also homodimers, in contrast to previous reports. The Lck-CD4 and Lck-CD8alpha cobalt(II)-bridged heterodimer complexes are more stable than the corresponding (Lck)(2)cobalt(II) complex by factors of 11 +/- 4 and 22 +/- 9, respectively. These studies were aided by the discovery that cobalt(II) complexes with a cobalt(II)(-Cys-X-X-Cys-)(-Cys-X-Cys-) chromophore show unusual optical spectra with one component of the visible d-d ((4)A(2)-to-(4)T(1)(P)) transition red-shifted and well separated from the other components. These results provide insights into the basis of specificity of metal-bridged complex formation and on the potential biological significance of metal-bridged homodimers in T-cells.
