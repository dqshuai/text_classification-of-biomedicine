Role of aquaporins in leaf physiology.

RB Heinen, Q Ye, F Chaumont

Playing a key role in plant growth and development, leaves need to be continuously supplied with water and carbon dioxide to fulfil their photosynthetic function. On its way through the leaf from the xylem to the stomata, water can either move through cell walls or pass from cell to cell to cross the different tissues. Although both pathways are probably used to some degree, evidence is accumulating that living cells contribute substantially to the overall leaf hydraulic conductance (K(leaf)). Transcellular water flow is facilitated and regulated by water channels in the membranes, named aquaporins (AQPs). This review addresses how AQP expression and activity effectively regulate the leaf water balance in normal conditions and modify the cell membrane water permeability in response to different environmental factors, such as irradiance, temperature, and water supply. The role of AQPs in leaf growth and movement, and in CO(2) transport is also discussed.
