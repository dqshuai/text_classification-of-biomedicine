Idiopathic venous thromboembolic disease is associated with a poorer prognosis from subsequent malignancy.

A Jones, DL Stockton, AJ Simpson, JT Murchison

METHODS: We carried out a retrospective study of prognosis in Scottish patients diagnosed with cancer within 5 years after a venous thromboembolism (VTE). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis was significantly poorer if a VTE occurred up to 2 years before cancer diagnosis, most notably if the cancer was diagnosed in the 6 months after a VTE.
