Aurora A moonlights in neurite extension.

GK Lefkowitz, JG Gleeson

Aurora A, an integral mitotic kinase, is essential for microtubule dynamics of post-mitotic neurons. PKCzeta activates Aurora A, which in turn phosphorylates NDEL1 to promote neurite extension. This raises the possibility that Aurora A may also be involved in establishing cell polarity and axon/dendrite elaboration in young neurons.
