Monosodium urate (MSU) crystals are among the most potent proinflammatory stimuli, and an innate immune inflammatory response to the crystal surface is involved in the pathology of gouty arthritis. Furthermore, MSU crystals have recently been identified as danger signals able to induce the maturation of dendritic cells. Release of the crystals into the joint cavity promotes an acute inflammation characterized by a massive infiltration of neutrophils that leads to tissue damage. Protein kinase C (PKC) represents a family of serine/threonine kinases that play central signaling roles in multiple cellular responses. This family of kinases is divided into three subfamilies based on second messenger requirements: conventional (or classical), novel, and atypical. Despite their role in signal transduction, very little is known about the involvement of the PKC family in the inflammatory reaction induced by MSU crystals. In the present study, we show that MSU crystals activate conventional PKC isoforms, and that this activation is necessary for the MSU crystal-induced degranulation and generation of a chemotactic activity in the supernatants of MSU crystal-stimulated human neutrophils. Evidence is also obtained that the tyrosine kinase Syk is a substrate of PKC and that the PKC-mediated serine phosphorylation of Syk is necessary to its interaction with the regulatory subunit of PI3K kinases (p85) and thus to the subsequent activation of these lipid kinases. These results suggest novel means of modulating neutrophil responses (through the specific regulation of PKC) during the acute phase of MSU crystal-induced inflammation.
