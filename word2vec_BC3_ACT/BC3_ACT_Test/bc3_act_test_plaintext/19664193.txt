Is there more to Wnt signalling in breast cancer than stabilisation of beta-catenin?

GM Collu, O Meurette, K Brennan

Increased Wnt signalling has been implicated in the aetiology of many different human cancers, including breast cancers. In most cases, Wnt signalling is thought to drive tumourigenesis through the stabilisation of cytosolic beta-catenin and the subsequent changes in the expression of T-cell factor (TCF)-dependent genes. However, this is not necessarily the only mechanism, as Wnt proteins can signal through a number of different intracellular signalling pathways. The ongoing work from Nancy Hynes' laboratory continues to highlight this latter possibility.
