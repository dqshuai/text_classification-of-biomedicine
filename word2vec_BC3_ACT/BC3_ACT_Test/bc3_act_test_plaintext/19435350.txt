Potassium is especially crucial in modulating the activity of muscles and nerves whose cells have specialized ion channels for transporting potassium. Normal body function extremely depends on the regulation of potassium concentrations inside the ion channels within a certain range. For life science, undoubtedly, it is significant and challenging to study and imitate these processes happening in living organisms with a convenient artificial system. Here we report a novel biomimetic nanochannel system which has an ion concentration effect that provides a nonlinear response to potassium ion at the concentration ranging from 0 to 1500 microM. This new phenomenon is caused by the G-quadruplex DNA conformational change with a positive correlation with ion concentration. In this work, G-quadruplex DNA was immobilized onto a synthetic nanopore, which undergoes a potassium-responsive conformational change and then induces the change in the effective pore size. The responsive ability of this system can be regulated by the stability of G-quadruplex structure through adjusting potassium concentration. The situation of the grafting G-quadruplex DNA on a single nanopore can closely imitate the in vivo condition because the G-rich telomere overhang is attached to the chromosome. Therefore, this artificial system could promote a potential to conveniently study biomolecule conformational change in confined space by the current measurement, which is significantly different from the nanopore sequencing. Moreover, such a system may also potentially spark further experimental and theoretical efforts to simulate the process of ion transport in living organisms and can be further generalized to other more complicated functional molecules for the exploitation of novel bioinspired intelligent nanopore machines.
