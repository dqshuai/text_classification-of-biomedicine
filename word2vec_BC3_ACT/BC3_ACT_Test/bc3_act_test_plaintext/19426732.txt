The intrinsic fluorescence of two apo-photoproteins has been characterized and its concentration-dependent quenching by coelenterazine has been for the first time applied to determine the apparent dissociation constants for coelenterazine binding with apo-aequorin (1.2+/-0.12 microM) and apo-obelin (0.2+/-0.04 microM). Stopped-flow measurements of fluorescence quenching showed that coelenterazine binding is a millisecond-scale process, in contrast to the formation of an active photoprotein complex taking several hours. This finding evidently shows that the rate-limiting step of active photoprotein formation is the conversion of coelenterazine into its 2-hydroperoxy derivative.
