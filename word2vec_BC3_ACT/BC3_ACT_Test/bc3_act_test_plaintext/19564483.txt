Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange provides a versatile platform for gene targeting: knockout of miR-31b.

R Weng, YW Chen, N Bushati, A Cliffe, SM Cohen

A series of vectors has been designed to enhance the versatility of targeted homologous recombination. Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange permits sequential targeting at any locus and improves flexibility in making user-defined mutations. Application of RMCE to delete an intronic microRNA gene is described.
