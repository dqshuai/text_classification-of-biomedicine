Murine melanoma B16F0 cells were transfected with SA:DPPC:DOPE (2:1:1 molar ratio) liposomes associated with a plasmid encoding murine IL-12. Stearylamine, a cationic lipid, showed a greater transfection efficiency compared to DOTAP-containing liposomes. The lipid:DNA ratio was 2:1 (w/w). Control groups were mock transfected or transfected with an empty plasmid (pNeo). pNeo or IL-12 transfected cells and controls were inoculated intradermically into the dorsal region of the foot or the lateral flank of C57BL6 mice. Results showed that IL-12 expression had a marked effect on in vivo growth of B16 melanoma tumors developed in both anatomic sites, significantly retarding their growth and prolonging host survival.
