Cell polarity is crucial for the generation of cell diversity. Recent evidence suggests that the actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in establishment of embryonic polarity, yet the mechanisms that maintain polarity cues in particular membrane domains during development remain unclear. Dynamin, a large GTPase, functions in both endocytosis and actin dynamics. Here, the Caenorhabditis elegans dynamin ortholog, DYN-1, maintains anterior polarity cues. DYN-1-GFP foci are enriched in the anterior cortex in a manner dependent on the anterior polarity proteins, PAR-6 and PKC-3. Membrane internalization and actin comet formation are enriched in the anterior, and are dependent on DYN-1. PAR-6-labeled puncta are also internalized from cortical accumulations of DYN-1-GFP. Our results demonstrate a mechanism for the spatial and temporal regulation of endocytosis in the anterior of the embryo, contributing to the precise localization and maintenance of polarity factors within a dynamic plasma membrane.
