Multiplex single-nucleotide polymorphism typing by nanoparticle-coupled DNA-templated reactions.

X Xue, W Xu, F Wang, X Liu

A novel chip-based detection approach for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing based on nanoparticle-coupled DNA-templated ligation reactions is reported. In contrast to conventional methods or recently developed techniques, this approach does not need costly instrumentation and complex stringency washing processes and offers both rapid multiplex SNP detection capability and ultrahigh sensitivity. The ability of the approach to quickly identify the precise location of the single-base mismatch may provide a time-efficient method for high-throughput multiplex SNP genotyping.
