LBH589 induces up to 10-fold SMN protein levels by several independent mechanisms and is effective even in cells from SMA patients non-responsive to valproate.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are potential candidates for therapeutic approaches in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)--a common autosomal recessive disorder and frequent cause of early childhood death. SMA is caused by homozygous absence of SMN1. Importantly, all SMA patients carry a nearly identical copy gene, SMN2, that produces only minor levels of correctly spliced full-length transcripts and SMN protein. Since an increased number of SMN2 copies strongly correlates with a milder SMA phenotype, activation or stabilization of SMN2 is considered as a therapeutic strategy. However, clinical trials demonstrated effectiveness of the HDACi valproate (VPA) and phenylbutyrate only in <50% of patients; therefore, identification of new drugs is of vital importance. Here we characterize the novel hydroxamic acid LBH589, an HDACi already widely used in cancer clinical trials. LBH589 treatment of human SMA fibroblasts induced up to 10-fold elevated SMN levels, the highest ever reported, accompanied by a markedly increased number of gems. FL-SMN2 levels were increased 2-3-fold by transcription activation via SMN2 promoter H3K9 hyperacetylation and restoration of correct splicing via elevated hTRA2-beta1 levels. Furthermore, LBH589 stabilizes SMN by reducing its ubiquitinylation as well as favouring incorporation into the SMN complex. Cytotoxic effects were not detectable at SMN2 activating concentrations. Notably, LBH589 also induces SMN2 expression in SMA fibroblasts inert to VPA, in human neural stem cells and in the spinal cord of SMN2-transgenic mice. Hence, LBH589, which is active already at nanomolar doses, is a highly promising candidate for SMA therapy.
