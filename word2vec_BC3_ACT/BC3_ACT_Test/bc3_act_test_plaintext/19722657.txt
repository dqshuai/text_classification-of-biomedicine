EPR spectroscopic trapping of the active species of nonheme iron-catalyzed oxidation.

OY Lyakin, KP Bryliakov, GJ Britovsek, EP Talsi

The key intermediate of a bioinspired iron catalyst for selective hydrocarbon oxidation based on hydrogen peroxide and an iron complex with a tetradentate aminopyridine ligand was trapped by EPR. On the basis of EPR and reactivity data this intermediate is tentatively proposed to be an oxoiron(V) complex.
