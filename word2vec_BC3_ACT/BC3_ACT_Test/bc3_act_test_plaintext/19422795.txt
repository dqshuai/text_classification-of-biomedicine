Calpastatin, a naturally occurring protein, is the only inhibitor that is specific for calpain. A novel blood-brain barrier (BBB)-permeant calpastatin-based calpain inhibitor, named B27-HYD, was developed and used to assess calpain's contribution to neurological dysfunction after stroke in rats. Postischemic administration of B27-HYD reduced infarct volume and neurological deficits by 35% and 44%, respectively, compared to untreated animals. We also show that the pharmacologic intervention has engaged the intended biologic target. Our data further demonstrates the potential utility of SBDP145, a signature biomarker of acute brain injury, in evaluating possible mechanisms of calpain in the pathogenesis of stroke and as an adjunct in guiding therapeutic decision making.
