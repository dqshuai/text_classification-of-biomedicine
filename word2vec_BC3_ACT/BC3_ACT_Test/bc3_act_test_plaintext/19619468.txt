Electrostatic exclusion of neutral solutes from condensed DNA and other charged phases.

BA Todd

Motivated by experiments on condensed DNA phases in binary mixtures of water and a low-dielectric solute, we develop a theory for the electrostatic contribution to solute exclusion from a highly charged phase, within the continuum approximation of the medium. Because the electric field is maximum at the surface of each ion, the electrostatic energy is dominated by the Born energy; interactions between charges are of secondary importance. Neglecting interactions and considering only the competition between the Born energy and the free energy of mixing, we predict that low dielectric solutes are excluded from condensed DNA phases in water-cosolvent mixtures. This suggests that the traditional continuum electrostatic approach of modeling binary mixtures with a uniform dielectric constant needs to be modified. The linking of solute exclusion to solute dielectric properties also suggests a mechanism for predicting the electrostatic contribution to preferential hydration of polar and charged surfaces.
