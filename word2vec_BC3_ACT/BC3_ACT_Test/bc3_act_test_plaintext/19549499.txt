Antigenic variation: extending the reach of telomeric silencing.

D Horn

Immune evasion in the parasitic African trypanosome relies upon the silencing of variant surface glycoprotein genes that are found adjacent to telomeres. Work on the RAP1 telomere-binding protein now indicates that silencing spreads over a sufficient distance to repress these genes.
