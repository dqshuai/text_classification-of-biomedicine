Frontiers in olefin polymerization: reinventing the world's most common synthetic polymers.

PD Hustad

Synthetic polymers are vital to our society, affecting practically every aspect of modern life. The ubiquitous nature of these materials is a result of years of collaboration between basic and applied researchers across many disciplines, resulting in economic routes to materials that meet customer needs. These considerations are exemplified by recent developments in the synthesis of block copolymers from simple olefins. The practical application of creative chemistry has produced materials with a favorable balance of desirable polymer properties and process economics.
