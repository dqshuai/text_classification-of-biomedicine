Entamoeba histolytica is known for its extraordinary capacity to destroy human tissues, leading to invasive diseases such as ulcerative colitis or extra-intestinal abscesses. In order to identify the virulence factors of this parasite phenotypes and proteomes of two recently identified genetically related cell lines (A and B), derived from the laboratory E. histolytica isolate HM-1:IMSS, were compared. Both cell lines are indistinguishable on the basis of highly polymorphic tandem repeat DNA sequences. However, cell line A is incapable to induce liver abscesses in experimentally infected rodents, whereas cell line B provokes considerable abscesses. Phenotypic analyses revealed increased hemolytic activity, lower growth rate, smaller cell size, reduced cysteine peptidase activity and lower resistance to nitric oxide stress for cell line A. In contrast, no differences between the two cell lines were found for cytopathic activity, erythrophagocytosis, digestion of erythrocytes or resistance to complement, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical anions. Proteomic comparison by 2-D DIGE followed by MS, identified a total of 21 proteins with higher abundance in cell line A and ten proteins with higher abundance in cell line B. Remarkably, three differentially up-regulated antioxidants were exclusively found in the pathogenic cell line B. Notably, only for two differentially regulated proteins, namely a Fe-hydrogenase and a C2 domain protein, a similar type was found at the level of transcription. Summarized, a defined set of different proteins could be identified between cell lines A and B. These molecules may have an important role in amoeba pathogenicity.
