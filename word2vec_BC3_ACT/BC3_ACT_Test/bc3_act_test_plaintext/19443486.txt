Copy number studies have led to an explosion in the discovery of new segmental duplication-mediated deletions and duplications. We have analyzed copy number changes in 2419 patients referred for clinical array comparative genomic hybridization studies. Twenty-three percent of the abnormal copy number changes we found are immediately flanked by segmental duplications > or =10 kb in size and > or =95% identical in direct orientation, consistent with deletions and duplications generated by non-allelic homologous recombination. Here, we describe copy number changes in five previously unreported loci with genomic organization characteristic of NAHR-mediated gains and losses; namely, 2q11.2, 7q36.1, 17q23, 2q13 and 7q11.21. Deletions and duplications of 2q11.2, deletions of 7q36.1 and deletions of 17q23 are interpreted as pathogenic based on their genomic size, gene content, de novo inheritance and absence from control populations. The clinical significance of 2q13 deletions and duplications is still emerging, as these imbalances are also found in phenotypically normal family members and control individuals. Deletion of 7q11.21 is a benign copy number change well represented in control populations and copy number variation databases. Here, we discuss the genetic factors that can modify the phenotypic expression of such gains and losses, which likely play a role in these and other recurrent genomic disorders.
