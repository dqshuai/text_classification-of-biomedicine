Elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) are considered a risk factor for chronic liver disease in patients with hyperinsulinemia. Insulin increases the expression of PAI-1, and inactivates the forkhead box-containing protein FoxO1. We were interested in whether the inactivation of FoxO1 is involved in the activation of PAI-1 expression under conditions of insulin stimulation. Here, we examined whether adenoviral-mediated expression of a constitutively active form of FoxO1 (Ad-CA-FoxO1) inhibited insulin-stimulated PAI-1 expression in human HepG2 hepatocellular liver carcinoma cells and mouse AML12 hepatocytes. Treatment of cells with insulin increased PAI-1 gene expression, and this effect was abolished by Ad-CA-FoxO1. Insulin also increased the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-induced expression of PAI-1 mRNA, and Ad-CA-FoxO1 inhibited this effect. Transient transfection assays using a reporter gene under the control of the PAI-1 promoter revealed that CA-FoxO1 inhibits Smad3-stimulated PAI-1 promoter activity. Taken together, our results indicate that FoxO1 inhibits PAI-1 expression through the inhibition of TGF-beta/Smad-mediated signaling pathways. Our data also suggest that in the hyperinsulinemic state, FoxO1 is inactivated by increased levels of insulin, and does not function as an inhibitor of TGF-beta-induced PAI-1 expression.
