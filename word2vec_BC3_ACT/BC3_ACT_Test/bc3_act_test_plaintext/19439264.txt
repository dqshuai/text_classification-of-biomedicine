Signaling pathways regulating zebrafish lateral line development.

EY Ma, DW Raible

The lateral line organ is a mechanosensory organ of fish and amphibians that detects changes in water flow. The lateral line organ of zebrafish has been used as a model for cell polarity and collective cell migration as well as hair cell loss and regeneration. A combination of genetic tools and live imaging has allowed dissection of signaling pathways that regulate these processes. Here, we summarize recent findings on the roles of the FGF, Wnt/beta-catenin, and Notch pathways in the initial formation of the posterior lateral line primordium, as well as during organ patterning, migration, cell fate specification and hair cell regeneration.
