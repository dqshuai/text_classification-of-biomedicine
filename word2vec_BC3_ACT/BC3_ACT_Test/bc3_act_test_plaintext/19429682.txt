Mitochondrial carriers are a family of proteins that transport metabolites, nucleotides, and cofactors across the inner mitochondrial membrane thereby connecting cytosolic and matrix functions. The essential cofactor coenzyme A (CoA) is synthesized outside the mitochondrial matrix and therefore must be transported into mitochondria where it is required for a number of fundamental processes. In this work we have functionally identified and characterized SLC25A42, a novel human member of the mitochondrial carrier family. The SLC25A42 gene (Haitina, T., Lindblom, J., Renstr√∂m, T., and Fredriksson, R., 2006, Genomics 88, 779-790) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. Its transport properties, kinetic parameters, and targeting to mitochondria demonstrate that SLC25A42 protein is a mitochondrial transporter for CoA and adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate. SLC25A42 catalyzed only a counter-exchange transport, exhibited a high transport affinity for CoA, dephospho-CoA, ADP, and adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate, was saturable and inhibited by bongkrekic acid and other inhibitors of mitochondrial carriers to various degrees. The main physiological role of SLC25A42 is to import CoA into mitochondria in exchange for intramitochondrial (deoxy)adenine nucleotides and adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate. This is the first time that a mitochondrial carrier for CoA and adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate has been characterized biochemically.
