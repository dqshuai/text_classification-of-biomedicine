Vicious circle: systemic autoreactivity in Ro52/TRIM21-deficient mice.

S Bolland, A Garcia-Sastre

Dysregulated innate responses, particularly excessive activation of interferon (IFN) pathways, have been implicated in the development of autoimmune pathologies. Autoreactivity frequently targets IFN-inducible genes such as the Ro autoantigens, which ubiquitinate and inhibit interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). A new study validates the role of these common autoantigens in preventing autoimmunity. The findings reveal that injury-induced systemic autoimmune disease is exacerbated in the absence of Ro52/Trim21 and is driven by the IL-23-Th17 pathway.
