BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence has demonstrated that Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is up-regulated in multiple malignancies, including oesophagus cancer, and plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and progression. However, till now, little is known about the role of NGAL in human rectal cancer. Its association with clinicopathologic characteristics and expression of MMP-9, one of its target genes, has not been reported systematically in rectal cancer. Therefore, to further determine the potential involvement of NGAL in rectal cancer, we have evaluated the expression level of NGAL mRNA by real time RT-PCR, and further elucidated the correlation of NGAL mRNA expression with clinicopathologic features and MMP-9 in rectal cancer. METHODS: 100 paired samples of rectal cancer and adjacent normal tissues obtained from inpatients undergoing surgical operation were allocated into two groups (cancer group and control group). The mRNA expression of NGAL and MMP-9 was determined by real-time RT-PCR. The association between their expression and clinicopathological characteristics of rectal cancer were analysised. RESULTS: Among the 100 rectal cancers, 69 cases of NGAL mRNA up-regulation were observed. NGAL mRNA up-regulation was positively correlated with MMP-9 (rs = 0.393, p < 0.001). In rectal cancer, NGAL mRNA overexpression was significantly associated with depth of invasion (p = 0.028), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.009), venous involvement (p = 0.023) and advanced pTNM stage (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: In human rectal cancer, NGAL mRNA expression was elevated. NGAL mRNA up-regulation was correlated significantly with tumor progression and MMP-9 mRNA overexpression in rectal cancer, suggesting a more aggressive phenotype. NGAL could be used for rectal cancer characterization.
