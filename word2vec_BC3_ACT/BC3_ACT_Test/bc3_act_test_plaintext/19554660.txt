AIM: To measure the normal space between the posterior wall of the vagina and the anterior wall of the respectively rectum using computed tomography (CT) and reveal its were relationship to rectocele. METHODS: A total of twenty female volunteers without rectocele were examined by CT scan. We performed a middle level continuous horizontal pelvic scan from the upper part to the lower part and collected the measurement data to analyze the results using t-test. RESULTS: Twenty volunteers were enrolled in the study. The space between the posterior wall of the vagina and the anterior wall of the rectum was measured at three levels (upper 1/3, middle, lower 1/3 level of vagina). The results showed that the space from the posterior wall of the vagina to the anterior wall of the rectum at the upper 1/3 level and the middle level was 3.896 +/- 0.3617 mm and 4.6575 +/- 0.3052 mm, respectively. When the two groups of data were compared, we found the space at the upper 1/3 level was shorter than at the middle level (P < 0.01). Moreover, at the lower 1/3 level the space measured was 10.058 +/- 0.4534 mm. The results revealed that the space at the lower 1/3 level was longer than that at the middle level (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These measurement data may be helpful in assessing rectocele clinical diagnosis and functional outcomes of rectocele repair.
