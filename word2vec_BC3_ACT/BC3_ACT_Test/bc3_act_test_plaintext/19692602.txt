PKC differentially translocates during spaced and massed training in Aplysia.

Learning is highly regulated by the pattern of training. In Aplysia, an important organism for the development of cellular and molecular models of learning, spaced versus massed application of the same stimulus leads to different forms of memory. A critical molecular step underlying memory is the serotonin (5HT)-mediated activation of the novel PKC Apl II. Here, we demonstrate that activation of PKC Apl II is highly sensitive to the pattern of 5HT application. Spaced applications downregulate PKC translocation through PKA signaling, whereas massed applications lead to persistent translocation of PKC. Differential regulation of PKC translocation is mediated by competing feedback mechanisms that act through protein synthesis. These studies elucidate a fundamental molecular difference between spaced and massed training protocols.
