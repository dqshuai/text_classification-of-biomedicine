Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) through transient receptor potential (TRP) channels is important in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Recently, stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) was identified as a key regulator of SOCE. In this study, we examined whether STIM1 is involved in the development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. RT-PCR showed that cultured rat cardiomyocytes constitutively expressed STIM1. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) treatment for 48h enhanced TRPC1 expression, SOCE, and nuclear factor of activated T cells activation without upregulating STIM1. However, the knockdown of STIM1 suppressed these effects, thereby preventing a hypertrophic response. These results suggest that STIM1 plays an essential role in the development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.
