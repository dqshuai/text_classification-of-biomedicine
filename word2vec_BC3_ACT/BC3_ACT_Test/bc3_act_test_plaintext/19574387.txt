Semiconductors have uniquely attractive properties for electronics and photonics. However, it has been difficult to find a highly coherent quantum state in a semiconductor for applications in quantum sensing and quantum information processing. We report coherent population trapping, an optical quantum interference effect, on a single hole. The results demonstrate that a hole spin in a quantum dot is highly coherent.
