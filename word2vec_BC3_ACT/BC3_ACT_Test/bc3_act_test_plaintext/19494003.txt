Topoisomerase I and RecQL1 function in Epstein-Barr virus lytic reactivation.

Cellular topoisomerases and helicases are thought to play an essential role in herpesvirus replication and gene expression and are considered to be potential targets for antiviral therapies. Topoisomerase I (Topo I) and Topo II inhibitors can selectively inhibit Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic cycle DNA replication. We found that the Topo I inhibitor camptothecin and, to a lesser extent, the Topo II inhibitor etoposide are potent inhibitors of the transcription and replication function of the EBV-encoded immediate-early protein Zta (also referred to as ZEBRA, EB1, and BZLF1). Camptothecin inhibited the Zta transcription activation of endogenous and reporter-linked viral promoters. Small interfering RNA depletion of Topo I also inhibited the Zta-dependent activation of lytic cycle DNA replication. Topo I could be coimmunoprecipitated with Zta, but this interaction was restricted to EBV-positive cells, suggesting that other viral proteins stabilize the interaction between Zta and Topo I. We also found that the RecQL1 helicase, which is known to associate with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) OriLyt, interacts with EBV OriLyt. Treatment with camptothecin reduced both Zta and RecQL1 binding to OriLyt in vivo, suggesting that Topo I promotes replication protein assembly at OriLyt.
