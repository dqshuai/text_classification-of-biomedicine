Reverse genetics and transient gene expression in fleshy fruits: overcoming plant stable transformation.

D Orzaez, A Granell

Fast methods to validate relevant candidate genes associated to fruit ripening are needed specially to associate gene function to the overwhelming amount of leads provided by genomic projects. In tomato, the use of Fruit VIGS in a Del/Ros1 background as described in the Plant Physiology by Orzaez et al. 2009, overcomes the difficulties associated to low efficiency VIGS in tomato and increases the reliability and throughput of this fast reverse genetic assay. The advantages of this transient assay system are discussed here for the case of gene functions associated to fruit ripening and quality traits. The possibility of using other reporters or even the development of transient overexpression assays in the fruit is also discussed.
