CarD tricks and magic spots: mechanisms of stringent control in mycobacteria.

LE Connolly, JS Cox

Global reprogramming of bacterial gene expression in response to nutritional stress, the stringent response, is well studied in E. coli. Now Stallings et al. report that Mycobacterium tuberculosis employs a different strategy involving the general transcription factor CarD for growth control and persistence in response to stresses encountered during infection.
