Endocrine glands-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF, also termed as Prok1)--a novel cytokine that selectively acts on the endothelial cells of endocrine glands--was recently reported to be involved in the regulation of tumor cell growth and survival. However, its roles in the regulation of pancreatic cancer progression remain unclear. In this report, we investigated the suppressive effects of EG-VEGF on pancreatic cancer cell apoptosis and the relevant mechanisms. By using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) we found that the Mia PaCa II cells of the pancreatic cancer cell line express the mRNAs of both EG-VEGF (Prok1) and its receptors. EG-VEGF protects pancreatic cancer cells from apoptosis through upregulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an anti-apoptotic protein of the bcl-2 family. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with EG-VEGF results in the rapid phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), STAT3, and AKT, which are involved in the upregulation of Mcl-1 expression. EG-VEGF (Prok1) protects Mia PaCa II cells from apoptosis through G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)-induced activation of multiple signal pathways, and hence can be a novel target for pancreatic cancer therapy.
