The electrochemical properties of 19-24 and related complexes with shorter pi-bridge ligands were assessed by cyclic voltammetry, and the linear optical, quadratic nonlinear optical, and cubic nonlinear optical properties were assayed by UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy, hyper-Rayleigh scattering studies at 1064 and 1300 nm, and broad spectral range femtosecond Z-scan studies, respectively. The Ru(II/III) oxidation potentials and wavelengths of the optical absorption maxima decrease on pi-bridge lengthening, until the tri(phenyleneethynylene) complex is reached, further chain lengthening leaving these parameters invariant; theoretical studies employing time-dependent density functional theory have shed light on this behavior. The quadratic nonlinearity beta(1064) and two-photon absorption cross-section reach maximal values at this same pi-bridge length, a similar saturation behavior that may reflect a common importance of ruthenium-to-alkynyl ligand charge transfer in electronic and optical behavior in these molecules.
