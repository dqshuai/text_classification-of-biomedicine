Secretin as a neurohypophysial factor regulating body water homeostasis.

Hypothalamic magnocellular neurons express either one of the neurohypophysial hormones, vasopressin or oxytocin, along with different neuropeptides or neuromodulators. Axonal terminals of these neurons are generally accepted to release solely the two hormones but not others into the circulation. Here, we show that secretin, originally isolated from upper intestinal mucosal extract, is present throughout the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial axis and that it is released from the posterior pituitary under plasma hyperosmolality conditions. In the hypothalamus, it stimulates vasopressin expression and release. Considering these findings together with our previous findings that show a direct effect of secretin on renal water reabsorption, we propose here that secretin works at multiple levels in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and kidney to regulate water homeostasis. Findings presented here challenge previous understanding regarding the neurohypophysis and could provide new concepts in treating disorders related to osmoregulation.
