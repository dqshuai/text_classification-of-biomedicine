Site-directed mutagenesis identifies a molecular switch involved in copper sensing by the histidine kinase CinS in Pseudomonas putida KT2440.

D Quaranta, MM McEvoy, C Rensing

In the presence of copper, Pseudomonas putida activates transcription of cinAQ via the two-component system CinS-CinR. The CinS-CinR TCS was responsive to 0.5 microM copper and was specifically activated only by copper and silver. Modeling studies of CinS identified a potential copper binding site containing H37 and H147. CinS mutants with H37R and H147R mutations had an almost 10-fold reduced copper-dependent induction of cinAQ compared to the wild type.
