A novel telomerase-associated protein was isolated from porcine testis. The 115-kDa protein, purified with telomerase activity, was molecular cloned using human cDNA library, and identified as MOV10. The expression levels of both MOV10 mRNA and MOV10 protein in cancer cells were 2-3 times higher than that of the normal cells, and MOV10 mRNA was highly expressed in human testis and ovary. The anti-MOV10 antibody precipitated the telomerase activity from cancer cell extracts, and inhibited the telomerase activity in vitro. Sf9-expressed MOV10 protein bound to G-rich strand of both single- and double-stranded telomere-sequenced DNA, but not to single C-rich strand. ChIP assay showed the binding of MOV10 to telomere region in vivo. These data suggest that MOV10 is involved in the progression of telomerase-catalyzing reaction via the interaction of telomerase protein and telomere DNA.
