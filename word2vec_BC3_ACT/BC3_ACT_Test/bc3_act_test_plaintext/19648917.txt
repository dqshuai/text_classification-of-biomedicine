Analysis of receptor-ligand interactions in vivo is key to biology but poses a considerable challenge to quantitative microscopy. Here we combine static-volume, two-focus and dual-color scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to solve this task at cellular resolution in complex biological environments. We quantified the mobility of fibroblast growth factor receptors Fgfr1 and Fgfr4 in cell membranes of living zebrafish embryos and determined their in vivo binding affinities to their ligand Fgf8.
