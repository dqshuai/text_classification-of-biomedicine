Pneumococcal LytR, a protein from the LytR-CpsA-Psr family, is essential for normal septum formation in Streptococcus pneumoniae.

O Johnsborg, LS HÃ¥varstein

Proliferation of the human-pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae is fundamentally linked to the bacterial proteins that function in cell division. Here, we show that LytR, a pneumococcal protein from the LytR-CpsA-Psr family, is essential to this process.
