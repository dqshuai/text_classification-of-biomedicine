MIWI-independent small RNAs (MSY-RNAs) bind to the RNA-binding protein, MSY2, in male germ cells.

M Xu, S Medvedev, J Yang, NB Hecht

The germ cell-specific DNA/RNA-binding protein MSY2 binds small RNAs (MSY-RNAs) that are approximately 25-31 nt in length, often initiate with a 5' adenine, and are expressed in both germ cells and somatic cells. MSY-RNA levels do not decrease in Miwi or Msy2 null mice. Most MSY-RNAs map within annotated genes, but some are PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA)-like and map to piRNA clusters. MSY-RNAs are in both nuclei and cytoplasm. In nuclei, MSY-RNAs are enriched in chromatin, and in the cytoplasm they are detected in both ribonucleoproteins and polysomes.
