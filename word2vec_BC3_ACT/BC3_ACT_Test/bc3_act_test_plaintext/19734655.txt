Dibenzothiophene monooxygenase (BdsC) from Bacillus subtilis WU-S2B utilized aromatic compounds not having sulfur atoms as substrates. It acted on indole and its derivatives to form indigoid pigments, and also utilized indoline and phenoxazine. In addition, BdsC exhibited activity toward benzothiophene (BT) derivatives but not BT, suggesting that it shows wide reactivity toward aromatic compounds.
