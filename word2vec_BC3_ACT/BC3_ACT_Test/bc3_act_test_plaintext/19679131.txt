The survey of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) has been extensively made in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, its still rare in viruses. Thus, we undertook a survey of SSRs in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) which is an excellent system to study evolution and roles of SSRs in viruses. Distribution of SSRs was examined in 81 completed HIV-1 genome sequences which come from 34 different countries or districts over 6 continents. In these surveyed sequences, although relative abundance and relative density exhibit very high similarity, some of these sequences show different preference for most common SSRs and longest SSRs. Our results suggest proportion of various repeat types might be related to genome stability.
