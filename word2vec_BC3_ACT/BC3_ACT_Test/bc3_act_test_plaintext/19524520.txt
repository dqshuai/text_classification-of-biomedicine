Neuron

Video game for monkeys.

JD Schlag, M Schlag-Rey

Recent progress in neurophysiological recording has developed in two directions. One relies on multimicroelectrodes to study correlations in neuron firing. The other relies on sophisticated tasks to distinguish successive stages of neuronal processing. In this issue of Neuron, Shichinohe et al. take this second approach to analyze neuronal mechanisms of pursuit.
