We use electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to quantify >100 phospholipid (PL) components in detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains that are related to ordered membrane compartments commonly known as lipid rafts. We previously compared PL compositions of DRMs with plasma membrane vesicles and whole cell lipid extracts from RBL mast cells, and we made the initial observation that antigen stimulation of IgE receptors (FcepsilonRI) causes a significant change in the PL composition of DRMs [Fridriksson, E. K., et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 8056-8063]. We now characterize the signaling requirements and time course for this change, which is manifested as an increase in the recovery of polyunsaturated PL in DRM, particularly in phosphatidylinositol species. We find that this change is largely independent of tyrosine phosphorylation, stimulated by engagement of FcepsilonRI, and can be activated by Ca(2+) ionophore in a manner independent of antigen stimulation. Unexpectedly, we found that inhibitors of actin polymerization (cytochalasin D and latrunculin A) cause a similar, but more rapid, change in the PL composition of DRMs in the absence of FcepsilonRI activation, indicating that perturbations in the actin cytoskeleton affect the organization of plasma membrane domains. Consistent with this interpretation, a membrane-permeable stabilizer of F-actin, jasplakinolide, prevents antigen-stimulated changes in DRM PL composition. These results are confirmed by a detailed analysis of multiple experiments, showing that receptor and cytochalasin D-stimulated changes in DRM lipid composition follow first-order kinetics. Analysis in terms of the number of double bonds in the fatty acid chains is valid for total PL of the major headgroups and for headgroups individually. In this manner, we show that, on average, concentrations of saturated or monounsaturated PL decrease in the DRM, whereas concentrations of PL with two or more double bonds (polyunsaturated PL) increase due to cytoskeletal perturbation. We find that these changes are independent of fatty acid chain length. Our mass spectrometric analyses provide a detailed accounting of receptor-activated alterations in the plasma membrane that are regulated by the actin cytoskeleton.
