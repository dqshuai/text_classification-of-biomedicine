Mast cell degranulation is a highly regulated, calcium-dependent process, which is important for the acute release of inflammatory mediators during the course of many pathological conditions. We previously found that Synaptotagmin-2, a calcium sensor in neuronal exocytosis, was expressed in a mast cell line. We postulated that this protein may be involved in the control of mast cell-regulated exocytosis, and we generated Synaptotagmin-2 knock-out mice to test our hypothesis. Mast cells from this mutant animal conferred an abnormally decreased passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction on mast cell-deficient mice that correlated with a specific defect in mast cell-regulated exocytosis, leaving constitutive exocytosis and nonexocytic mast cell effector responses intact. This defect was not secondary to abnormalities in the development, maturation, migration, morphology, synthesis, and storage of inflammatory mediators, or intracellular calcium transients of the mast cells. Unlike neurons, the lack of Synaptotagmin-2 in mast cells was not associated with increased spontaneous exocytosis.
