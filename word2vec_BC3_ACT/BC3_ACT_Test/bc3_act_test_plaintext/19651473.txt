Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV): molecular biology and oncogenesis.

KW Wen, B Damania

Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a double-stranded DNA herpesvirus belonging to the gamma-herpesvirinae subfamily. KSHV has been associated with the development of three neoplastic diseases: Kaposi sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman disease (MCD). In this review, we discuss the three KSHV-associated malignancies, KSHV genome, latent and lytic aspects of the viral lifecycle, putative viral oncogenes, as well as therapeutic regimens used for the treatment of KS, PEL, and MCD.
