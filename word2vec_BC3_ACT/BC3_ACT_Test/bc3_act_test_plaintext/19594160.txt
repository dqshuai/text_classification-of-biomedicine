Ir doping-induced superconductivity in the SmFeAsO system.

YL Chen, CH Cheng, YJ Cui, H Zhang, Y Zhang, Y Yang, Y Zhao

The 5d transition metal Ir is successfully doped for Fe in SmFeAsO to induce superconductivity with T(c) = 16 K at a doping level of approximately 15 atom %. Ir doping decreases the As-Fe-As bond angle, beta; this behavior is different from the change in beta for the system with doping charges in the charge-reservoir layers.
