Hepatitis C Virus entry: the early steps in the viral replication cycle.

A Sabahi

Approximately 170 million are infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) world wide and an estimated 2.7 million are HCV RNA positive in the United States alone. The acute phase of the HCV infection, in majority of individuals, is asymptomatic. A large percentage of those infected with HCV are unable to clear the virus and become chronically infected. The study of the HCV replication cycle was hampered due to difficulties in growing and propagating the virus in an in vitro setting. The advent of the HCV pseudo particle (HCVpp) and HCV cell culture (HCVcc) systems have made possible the study of the HCV replication cycle, in vitro. Studies utilizing the HCVpp and HCVcc systems have increased our insight into the early steps of the viral replication cycle of HCV, such as the identification of cellular co-receptors for binding and entry. The aim of this article is to provide a review of the outstanding literature on HCV entry, specifically looking at cellular co-receptors involved and putting the data in the context of the systems used (purified viral envelope proteins, HCVpp system, HCVcc system and/or patient sera) and to also give a brief description of the cellular co-receptors themselves.
