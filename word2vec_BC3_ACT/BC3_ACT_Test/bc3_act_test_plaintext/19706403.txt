Noonan syndrome is associated with enhanced pERK activity, the repression of which can prevent craniofacial malformations.

A gain of function mutation in SHP2, a protein phosphatase encoded by PTPN11, causes Noonan syndrome (NS), which is characterized in part by developmental deficits in both the cardiac and skull fields. Previously, we found that expression of the mutated protein SHP2 Q79R in the heart led to a phenotypic presentation that mimicked some aspects of NS and that this was dependent upon activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. To understand the role that ERK1/2 signaling plays in skull development through signaling in the neural crest, we explored the consequences of Q79R expression in neural crest cells, which contribute to a subset of the bony and cartilaginous structures of the skull. Hyperactivation of ERK1/2 led to craniofacial defects that included smaller skull lengths, greater inner canthal distances, and taller frontal bone heights. In proportion to the smaller skull length, mandibular bone length was also reduced. Inhibition of ERK1/2 hyperactivity as a result of Q79R expression was achieved by injection of the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor U0126 during pregnancy. The drug effectively decreased the severity of the craniofacial defects and restored normal skull shape and fontanelle closure. X-ray computer-assisted microtomography analysis of the head confirmed that decreasing ERK1/2 activity led to an abrogation of the craniofacial deficits and brain shape changes that presented in the mice. These data show that normal ERK1/2 signaling in the neural crest is imperative for normal craniofacial development and offer insight into how the heart and craniofacial developmental fields might be affected in some congenital syndromic presentations.
