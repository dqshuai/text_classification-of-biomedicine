Combined goblet cell carcinoid and mucinous cystadenoma of the vermiform appendix.

KO Alsaad, S Serra, R Chetty

Goblet cell carcinoid is an uncommon primary tumor of the vermiform appendix, characterized by dual endocrine and glandular differentiation. Whether goblet cell carcinoid represents a morphological variant of appendiceal classical carcinoid or a mucin-producing adenocarcinoma is a matter of conjecture. Rare cases of goblet cell carcinoid with other concomitant appendiceal epithelial neoplasms have been documented. In this report, we describe a rare case of combined appendiceal goblet cell carcinoid and mucinous cystadenoma, and discuss the possible histopathogenesis of this combination.
