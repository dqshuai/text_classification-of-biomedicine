Smaller discoidal high-density lipoprotein particles form saddle surfaces, but not planar bilayers.

Discoidal high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles are known to be fractionalized into several discrete populations in plasma and to differ in behavior according to size; however, their structural differences and the factors regulating their size are less understood. In this study, we prepared several reconstituted HDLs (rHDLs) for structural evaluation by gel filtration chromatography and fluorometric analyses. With initial ratios of phospholipid (PL) to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) between 25:1 and 100:1, unsaturated PLs constructed rHDLs with diameters of 9.5-9.6, 8.8-9.0, and 7.8-7.9 nm. Conversely, saturated PLs formed only the largest type of rHDLs (9.5-9.9 nm). While the largest rHDL comprised 23% cholesterol (Chol), the smallest rHDL contained only 13% Chol, which approximates liquid-ordered phase composition. As the size of rHDLs decreased, both the lateral pressure in the lipid bilayer, as determined from the excimer fluorescence of dipyrenylphosphatidylcholine, and the degree of hydration of the membrane surface, which was examined using the mean fluorescence lifetime of dansyl phosphatidylethanolamine, decreased well below the values obtained for large unilamellar vesicles. These results demonstrated that smaller rHDLs form a saddle surface, distinct from the planar bilayer produced by the largest forms.
