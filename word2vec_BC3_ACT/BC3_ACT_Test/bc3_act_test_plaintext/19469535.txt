Coupling reactions in aldehydes adsorbed on V(100) single-crystal surfaces.

M Shen, F Zaera

The thermal chemistry of formaldehyde on vanadium (100) single-crystal surfaces was characterized under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions by using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in combination with isotope-labeling experiments. Particular emphasis was placed on establishing a mechanism for the formation of ethylene, which was observed to desorb in two temperature regimes, at 290 and 540 K. The low-temperature reaction was determined to occur via the coupling of methylene groups formed on the surface upon dissociation of the C-O bond in adsorbed formaldehyde. The high-temperature ethylene, on the other hand, was proven to require the prior formation of a diolate, -OCH(2)CH(2)O-, intermediate. This chemistry was shown to be quite general, also occurring in cross-coupling mode between two different coadsorbed aldehydes.
