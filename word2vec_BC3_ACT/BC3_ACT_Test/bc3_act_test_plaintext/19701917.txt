Laser microdissection (LMD), a method of isolating specific microscopic regions of interest from a tissue that has been sectioned, is increasingly being applied to study proteomics. LMD generally requires tissues to be fixed and histologically stained, which can interfere with protein recovery and subsequent analysis. We evaluated the compatibility and reproducibility of protein extractions from laser microdissected human colon mucosa using a subcellular fractionation kit (ProteoExtract, Calbiochem). Four protein fractions corresponding to cytosol (fraction 1), membrane/organelle (fraction 2), nucleus (fraction 3) and cytoskeleton (fraction 4) were extracted, saturation labeled with Cy5 and 5 microg separated by both acidic (pH 4-7) and basic (pH 6-11) 2-DE. The histological stains and fixation required for LMD did not interfere with the accurate subcellular fractionation of proteins into their predicted fraction. The combination of subcellular fractionation and saturation CyDye labeling produced very well resolved, distinct protein spot maps by 2-DE for each of the subcellular fractions, and the total number of protein spots consistently resolved between three independent extractions for each fraction was 893, 1128, 1245 and 1577 for fractions 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Although significant carryover of protein did occur between fractions, this carryover was consistent between experiments, and very low inter-experimental variation was observed. In summary, subcellular fractionation kits are very compatible with saturation labeling DIGE of LMD tissues and provide greater coverage of proteins from very small amounts of microdissected material.
