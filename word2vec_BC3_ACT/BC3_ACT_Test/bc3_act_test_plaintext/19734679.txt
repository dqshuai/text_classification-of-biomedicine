Inhibitory effect of quercetin isolated from rose hip (Rosa canina L.) against melanogenesis by mouse melanoma cells.

T Fujii, M Saito

We investigated the effects of compounds isolated from a methanolic extract of rose hips on melanin biosynthesis in B16 mouse melanoma cells and the possible mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of melanin biosynthesis. We found that, among the isolated compounds, quercetin was a particularly potent melanogenesis inhibitor. To reveal the mechanism for this inhibition, the effects on tyrosinase of B16 mouse melanoma were measured. Quercetin decreased the intracellular tyrosinase activity as well as the tyrosinase activity in a cell culture-free system. We also examined the cellular level of tyrosinase protein and found that quercetin dose-dependently inhibited tyrosinase protein expression. We consider from these results that the inhibition of melanogenesis by quercetin was due to the inhibition of both tyrosinase activity and of the protein expression.
