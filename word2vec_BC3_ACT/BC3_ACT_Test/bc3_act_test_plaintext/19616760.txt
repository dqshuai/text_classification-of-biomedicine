Finding Leishmania: a deadly game of hide-and-seek.

P Scott

Leishmaniasis is a chronic infection in which intracellular parasites avoid destruction by the immune system. Using intravital imaging, Filipe-Santos et al. (2009) demonstrate that some parasitized dendritic cells receive much less attention than others during their choreographed dance with T cells, suggesting that these "wallflowers" could allow for parasite survival.
