Controllable and scalable production is of great importance for the application of graphene; however, to date, it is still a great challenge and a major obstacle which hampers its practical applications. Here, we develop a template chemical vapor deposition method for scalable synthesis of few-layer graphene ribbons (FLGRs) with controlled morphologies. The FLGRs have a good conductivity and are ideal for use in nanoelectromechanics (NEM). As an application, we fabricate a reversible NEM switch and a logic gate by using the FLGRs. This work realizes both controllable and scalable synthesis of graphene, provides an application of graphene in NEM switches, and would be valuable for both the scientific studies and the practical applications of graphene.
