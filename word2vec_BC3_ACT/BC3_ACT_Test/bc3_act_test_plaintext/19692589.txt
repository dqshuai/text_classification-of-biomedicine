Mechanisms for transcellular diapedesis: probing and pathfinding by 'invadosome-like protrusions'.

CV Carman

Immune-system functions require that blood leukocytes continuously traffic throughout the body and repeatedly cross endothelial barriers (i.e. diapedese) as they enter (intravasate) and exit (extravasate) the circulation. The very earliest studies to characterize diapedesis directly in vivo suggested the coexistence of two distinct migratory pathways of leukocytes: between (paracellular pathway) and directly through (transcellular pathway) individual endothelial cells. In vivo studies over the past 50 years have demonstrated significant use of the transcellular diapedesis pathway in bone marrow, thymus, secondary lymphoid organs, various lymphatic structures and peripheral tissues during inflammation and across the blood-brain barrier and blood-retinal barrier during inflammatory pathology. Recently, the first in vitro reports of transcellular diapedesis have emerged. Together, these in vitro and in vivo observations suggest a model of migratory pathfinding in which dynamic 'invadosome-like protrusions' formed by leukocytes have a central role in both identifying and exploiting endothelial locations that are permissive for transcellular diapedesis. Such 'probing' activity might have additional roles in this and other settings.
