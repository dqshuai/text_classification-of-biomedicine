Reaction regimes on the synthesis of hollow particles by the Kirkendall effect.

A Cabot, M Ibáñez, P Guardia, AP Alivisatos

The formation of hollow vs solid particles by means of the oxidation reaction of solid metal particles depends on the differential self-diffusivities of the reactants through the composite shell, the reaction probabilities at each interface, and the concentration and diffusivity of the element in solution. By means of a kinetic model of the oxidation process, we determine the phase diagrams for the geometry of the oxidized particles and propose four shell growth regimes. We experimentally illustrate the different growth scenarios by changing the conditions of oxidation of cadmium spherical crystals using different chalcogen precursors.
