DNA double-strand breaks in meiosis: checking their formation, processing and repair.

MP Longhese, D Bonetti, I Guerini, N Manfrini, M Clerici

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly hazardous for genome integrity, but meiotic cells deliberately introduce them into their genome in order to initiate homologous recombination, which ensures proper homologous chromosome segregation. To minimize the risk of deleterious effects, meiotic DSB formation, processing and repair are tightly regulated in order to occur only at the right time and place. Furthermore, a highly conserved signal-transduction pathway, called meiotic recombination checkpoint, coordinates DSB repair with meiotic progression and promotes meiotic recombination.
