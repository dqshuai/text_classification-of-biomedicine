We have previously shown that vaccination with purified Entamoeba histolytica Gal/GalNAc lectin or recombinant subunits can protect mice from intestinal amebiasis upon intracecal challenge. In this study, we demonstrated with adoptive-transfer experiments that this lectin vaccine protection is mediated by T cells but not serum. The cell-mediated immune (CMI) response was characterized by significant gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), interleukin 12 (IL-12), IL-2, IL-10, and IL-17 production. To move toward a human vaccine, we switched to a recombinant protein and tested a range of adjuvants and routes appropriate for humans. We found that subcutaneous delivery of LecA with IDRI's adjuvant system EM014 elicited a potent Th1-type CMI profile and provided significant protection, as measured by culture negativity (79% efficacy); intranasal immunization with cholera toxin provided 56% efficacy; and alum induced a Th2-type response that protected 62 to 68% of mice. Several antibody and CMI cytokine responses were examined for correlates of protection, and prechallenge IFN-gamma(+) or IFN-gamma-, IL-2-, and tumor necrosis factor alpha-triple-positive CD4 cells in blood were statistically associated with protection. To test the role of IFN-gamma in LecA-mediated protection, we neutralized IFN-gamma in LecA-immunized mice and found that it abrogated the protection conferred by vaccination. These data demonstrate that CMI is sufficient for vaccine protection from intestinal amebiasis and reveal an important role for IFN-gamma, even in the setting of alum.
