We report a microelectrochemical array composed of 1000 individual bipolar electrodes that are controlled with just two driving electrodes and a simple power supply. The system is configured so that faradaic processes occurring at the cathode end of each electrode are correlated to light emission via electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) at the anode end. This makes it possible to read out the state of each electrode simultaneously. The significant advance is that the electrode array is fabricated on a glass microscope slide and is operated in a simple electrochemical cell. This eliminates the need for microfluidic channels, provides a fabrication route to arbitrarily large electrode arrays, and will make it possible to place sensing chemistries onto each electrode using a robotic spotter.
