Rhodium-catalyzed coupling of 2-silylphenylboronic acids with alkynes leading to benzosiloles: catalytic cleavage of the carbon-silicon bond in trialkylsilyl groups.

M Tobisu, M Onoe, Y Kita, N Chatani

The reaction of 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenylboronic acid with alkynes in the presence of a rhodium catalyst affords benzosilole derivatives. The arylvinylrhodium intermediate undergoes formal substitution at a silicon center, resulting in the cleavage of a robust silicon-methyl bond in the trimethylsilyl group.
