Jumping translocation breakpoint protein (JTB) is suppressed in many cancers, implying it plays a role in the neoplastic transformation of cells. In order to explore the role of JTB in the carcinogenesis of liver, we used mammalian two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, GST pull-down and laser scanning confocal to verify the interaction between HBs and JTB. According to the results, HBs interacts with JTB. In addition, we further determined that S region within HBs is sufficient for binding JTB. Overexpression of JTB conferred resistance to apoptosis induced by ultraviolet radiation, whereas this effect was compromised by the co-overexpression of HBs.
