Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase is commonly overexpressed in human cancers; however, the cellular mechanisms regulating EGFR expression remain unclear. p53, p63 and p73 are transcription factors regulating many cellular targets involved in controlling the cell cycle and apoptosis. p53 activates EGFR expression, whereas TAp63 represses EGFR transcription. The involvement of p73 in the regulation of EGFR has not been reported. Here, a strong correlation between EGFR overexpression and increased levels of the oncogenic DeltaNp73 isoform in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines was observed. Ectopic expression of TAp73, particularly TAp73beta, resulted in suppression of the EGFR promoter, significant downregulation of EGFR protein and efficient induction of cell death in all six EGFR-overexpressing HNSCC cell lines. EGFR overexpression from a heterologous LTR promoter protected lung cancer cells from TAp73beta-induced EGFR suppression and apoptosis. Expression of TAp73beta efficiently induced promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein expression and PML knockdown by shRNA attenuated the downregulation of EGFR and induction of apoptosis by p73 in HNSCC cells. Furthermore, PML was found to be important for E1A-induced suppression of EGFR and subsequent killing of HNSCC cells. Our data therefore suggest a novel pathway involving PML and p73 in the regulation of EGFR expression.
