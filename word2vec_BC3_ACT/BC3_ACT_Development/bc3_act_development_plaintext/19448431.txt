Cell cycle re-entry of quiescent T lymphocytes regulated by cdk2 is required for antigen-specific clonal expansion and generation of productive T cell responses. Recently, we determined that induction of antigen-specific T cell tolerance results in impaired cdk2 activity leading to enhanced Smad3 transactivation, upregulation of p15 and blockade of cell cycle progression. Here we report that pharmacologic inhibition of cdk2 with (R)-roscovitine blocked expansion of alloreactive T cells in vitro and in vivo and protected from lethal acute GvHD. In addition to inhibiting alloreactive T cell responses, (R)-roscovitine prevented TNF-alpha-mediated activation of NF-kappa B pathway, which is involved in the inflammatory process leading to the development of GvHD. The combined anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory properties of (R)-roscovitine make it an attractive treatment modality toward control of GvHD.
