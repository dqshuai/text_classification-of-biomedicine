Carboxypeptidase N (CPN) is a plasma zinc metalloprotease, which consists of two enzymatically active small subunits (CPN1) and two large subunits (CPN2) that protect the protein from degradation. Historically, CPN has been implicated as a major regulator of inflammation by its enzymatic cleavage of functionally important arginine and lysine amino acids from potent phlogistic molecules, such as the complement anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Because of no known complete CPN deficiencies, the biological impact of CPN in vivo has been difficult to evaluate. Here, we report the generation of a mouse with complete CPN deficiency by targeted disruption of the CPN1 gene. CPN1(-/-) mice were hypersensitive to lethal anaphylactic shock due to acute complement activation by cobra venom factor. This hypersensitivity was completely resolved in CPN1(-/-)/C5aR(-/-) but not in CPN1(-/-)/C3aR(-/-) mice. Moreover, CPN1(-/-) mice given C5a i.v., but not C3a, experienced 100% mortality. This C5a-induced mortality was reduced to 20% when CPN1(-/-) mice were treated with an antihistamine before C5a challenge. These studies describe for the first time a complete deficiency of CPN and demonstrate 1) that CPN plays a requisite role in regulating the lethal effects of anaphylatoxin-mediated shock, 2) that these lethal effects are mediated predominantly by C5a-induced histamine release, and 3) that C3a does not contribute significantly to shock following acute complement activation.
