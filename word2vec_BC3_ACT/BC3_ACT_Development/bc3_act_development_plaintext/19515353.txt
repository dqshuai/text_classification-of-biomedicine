Intracellular signaling: peripatetic Ras.

N Fehrenbacher, M Philips

Ras proteins traffic between the plasma membrane and endomembranes and signal from the cytosolic face of a variety of organelles. Palmitoylated N-Ras and H-Ras signal from early endosomes. A recent study reports that K-Ras resides on and signals from various types of endosomes, including late endosomes/lysosomes and multivesicular bodies.
