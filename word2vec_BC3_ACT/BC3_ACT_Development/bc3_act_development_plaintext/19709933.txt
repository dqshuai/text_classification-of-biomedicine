PIKK-dependent phosphorylation of Mre11 induces MRN complex inactivation by disassembly from chromatin.

The role of Mre11 phosphorylation in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is not well understood. Here, we show that phosphorylation of Mre11 at SQ/TQ motifs by PIKKs (PI3 Kinase-related Kinases) induces MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) complex dissociation from chromatin by reducing Mre11 affinity for DNA. Whereas phosphorylation of Mre11 at these residues is not required for DSB-induced ATM (Ataxia-Telangiectasia mutated) activation, abrogation of Mre11 dephosphorylation impairs ATM signaling. Our study provides a functional characterization of the DNA damage-induced Mre11 phosphorylation, and suggests that MRN inactivation participates in the down-regulation of damage signaling during checkpoint recovery following DSB repair.
