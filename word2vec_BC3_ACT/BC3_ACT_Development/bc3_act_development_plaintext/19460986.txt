Comment on "Functional traits and niche-based tree community assembly in an Amazonian forest".

JK Lake, A Ostling

Kraft et al. (Reports, 24 October 2008, p. 580) used a variety of metrics describing the distribution of functional traits within a tropical forest community to demonstrate simultaneous environmental filtering and niche differentiation. We discuss how these results could have arisen from sampling design and statistical assumptions, suggesting alternative approaches that could better resolve these questions.
