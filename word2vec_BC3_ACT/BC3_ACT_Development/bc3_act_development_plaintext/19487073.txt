Plant lectins: potential antineoplastic drugs from bench to clinic.

B Liu, HJ Bian, JK Bao

Plant lectins, carbohydrate-binding proteins distributed widely in a variety of plant species, have drawn a rising attention for cancer biologists due to their remarkable anti-tumour properties. In this review, we present a brief outline of the up-to-date advances of plant lectins in elucidating their complex anti-cancer mechanisms implicated in apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, we further discuss the pre-clinical and clinical studies of plant lectins for their potential therapeutic applications. In conclusion, these inspiring findings would open a new perspective for plant lectins as potential antineoplastic drugs from bench to clinic.
