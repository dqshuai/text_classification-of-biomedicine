High marks for GWAS.

Two genome-wide association studies for testicular cancer report associations at three new loci, including two candidate genes previously implicated in testicular development, KITLG (ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase) and SPRY4 (sprouty 4). These studies are notable for the high effect sizes detected and the biological plausibility of the candidate genes.
