Grass carp hemorrhagic virus (GCHV)-induced gene 2 (Gig2) is a novel gene previously identified from UV-inactivated GCHV-treated Carassius auratus blastulae embryonic (CAB) cells, suggesting that it should play a pivotal role in the interferon (IFN) antiviral response. In this study, a polyclonal anti-Gig2 antiserum was generated and used to study the inductive expression pattern by Western blot analysis, showing no basal expression in normal CAB cells but a significant up-regulation upon UV-inactivated GCHV, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) and recombinant IFN (rIFN). However, constitutive expression of Gig2 is observed in all tested tissues from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), and Poly I:C injection increases the relative amount of Gig2 protein in skin, spleen, trunk kidney, gill, hindgut and thymus. Moreover, the genomic sequence covering the whole Gig2 ORF and the upstream promoter region were amplified by genomic walking. Significantly, the Gig2 promoter contains three IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), nine GAAA/TTTC motifs and five gamma-IFN activating sites (GAS), which are the characteristics of genes responsive to both type I IFN and type II IFN. Subsequently, the complete Gig2 promoter sequence was cloned into pGL3-Basic vector, and its activity was measured by luciferase assays in the transfected CAB cells. The Gig2 promoter-driven construct is highly induced in CAB cells after treatment with Poly I:C or rIFN, and the functional capability is dependent on IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), because its activity can be stimulated by IRF7. Collectively, the data provide strong evidence that Gig2 is indeed a novel IFN inducible gene and its expression is likely dependent on IRF7 upon Poly I:C or IFN.
