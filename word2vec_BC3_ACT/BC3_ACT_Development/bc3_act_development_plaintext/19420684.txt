A new reagent, N-[2-(diphenylphosphino)ethyl]-4-(1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-8-yl)benzamide (DPPEA-BODIPY), was designed and synthesized for analysis of hydroperoxides. DPPEA-BODIPY fluoresces at low levels in the visible range (lambda(ex)/lambda(em) = 502 nm/515 nm) and reacts with hydroperoxides to produce DPPEA-BODIPY oxide, which fluoresces at high levels. The fluorescence intensity of the reaction mixture was observed to be linearly related to the methyl linoleate hydroperoxide (MeLOOH) concentration.
