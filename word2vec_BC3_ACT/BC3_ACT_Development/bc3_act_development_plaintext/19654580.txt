BACKGROUND: CD26 is a multifunctional membrane-bound glycoprotein that regulates tumour growth in addition to its other activities. Because disease aggressiveness is correlated with CD26 expression in several T-cell malignancies, we decided to investigate the invasiveness of cells expressing different levels of CD26. METHODS: To assess CD26 involvement in cell invasion, we performed in vitro invasion assays with human T cell lines expressing different levels of CD26. These included the parental CD26-positive T-lymphoblast cell line HSB-2 and clones infected with a retrovirus expressing siRNA vectors that either targeted CD26 or encoded a missense siRNA, and the parental CD26-negative T-leukaemia cell line Jurkat and clones expressing CD26. CD26 expression in these cell lines was evaluated by flow cytometry and western immunoblotting. CXCR4 expression, phosphorylation of signalling kinases, and MMP-9 secretion were also evaluated by western immunoblotting, whereas MMP-9 activity and the effect of kinase and CD45 inhibitors on activity were measured by zymography of conditioned media. RESULTS: The presence of CD26 enhanced stromal-cell-derived factor-1-alpha (SDF-1-alpha)-mediated invasion of T cell lines. This process was regulated in part by the PI-3K and MEK1 pathways, as indicated by increased phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase and Akt in the presence of SDF-1-alpha and the effect of their respective inhibitors on MMP-9 secretion and in vitro invasion. In addition, CD26-associated enhancement of SDF-1-alpha-induced invasion was decreased when CD45 was inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the expression of CD26 in T cell lines leads to increased SDF-1-alpha-mediated invasion in an in vitro system and that this is controlled in part by the PI-3K and MEK1 pathways. The data also suggest that CD26 enhancement of invasion may be mediated by CD45, however, more studies are required to confirm this involvement.
