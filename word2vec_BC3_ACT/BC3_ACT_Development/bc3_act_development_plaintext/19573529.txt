Musashi1 (Msi1) is an RNA-binding protein that is highly expressed in neural stem cells, and is considered to be a stemness factor. A known function of Msi1 is translational repression of specifically bound mRNAs. Although the basic mechanism and some target RNAs have been reported, further survey of interactors is necessary to understand the integrated function of Msi1. By screening using an mRNA display technique, we found that doublecortin (dcx) mRNA is a specific binding target of Msi1 in vitro. We confirmed that Msil repressed translation of a luciferase reporter gene linked to the selected 3'-untranslated region fragment of dcx in Neuro2A cells.
