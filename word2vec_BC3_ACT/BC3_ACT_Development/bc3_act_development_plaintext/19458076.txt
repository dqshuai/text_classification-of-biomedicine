Combined inhibition of MEK and mammalian target of rapamycin abolishes phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 in glioblastoma cell lines and prevents their proliferation.

S Paternot, PP Roger

The Ras/Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways are aberrantly activated in many tumors, including highly proliferative glioblastomas, but how they are wired with the cell cycle remains imperfectly understood. Inhibitors of MEK/ERK and mTOR pathways are tested as anticancer agents. They are generally considered to induce a G(1) cell cycle arrest through down-regulation of D-type cyclins and up-regulation of p27(kip1). Here, we examined the effect of targeting mTOR by rapamycin and/or MEK by PD184352 in human glioblastoma cell lines. In combination, these drugs cooperatively and potently inhibited the G(1)-S transition and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. Their cooperation could not be explained by their partial and differential inhibitory effects on cyclin D1 or D3 but instead by their synergistic inhibition of the activating T172 phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4. This appeared independent of p27 and unrelated to weak modulations of the CDK-activating kinase activity. The T172 phosphorylation of CDK4 thus appears as a crucial node integrating the activity of both MEK/ERK and mTOR pathways. Combined inhibition of both pathways should be considered as a promising strategy for treatment of tumors harboring a deregulated CDK4 activity.
