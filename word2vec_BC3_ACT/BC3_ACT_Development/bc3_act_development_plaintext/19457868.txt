Berberine bridge enzyme (BBE) is a member of the recently discovered family of bicovalently flavinylated proteins. In this group of enzymes, the FAD cofactor is linked via its 8alpha-methyl group and the C-6 atom to conserved histidine and cysteine residues, His-104 and Cys-166 for BBE, respectively. 6-S-Cysteinylation has recently been shown to have a significant influence on the redox potential of the flavin cofactor; however, 8alpha-histidylation evaded a closer characterization due to extremely low expression levels upon substitution. Co-overexpression of protein disulfide isomerase improved expression levels and allowed isolation and purification of the H104A protein variant. To gain more insight into the functional role of the unusual dual mode of cofactor attachment, we solved the x-ray crystal structures of two mutant proteins, H104A and C166A BBE, each lacking one of the covalent linkages. Information from a structure of wild type enzyme in complex with the product of the catalyzed reaction is combined with the kinetic and structural characterization of the protein variants to demonstrate the importance of the bicovalent linkage for substrate binding and efficient oxidation. In addition, the redox potential of the flavin cofactor is enhanced additively by the dual mode of cofactor attachment. The reduced level of expression for the H104A mutant protein and the difficulty of isolating even small amounts of the protein variant with both linkages removed (H104A-C166A) also points toward a possible role of covalent flavinylation during protein folding.
