Simian virus 40 large T antigen (TAg) contributes to cell transformation, in part, by targeting two well-characterized tumor suppressors, pRb and p53. TAg expression affects the transcriptional circuits controlled by Rb and by p53. We have performed a microarray analysis to examine the global change in gene expression induced by wild-type TAg (TAg(wt)) and TAg mutants, in an effort to link changes in gene expression to specific transforming functions. For this analysis we have used enterocytes from the mouse small intestine expressing TAg. Expression of TAg(wt) in the mouse intestine results in hyperplasia and dysplasia. Our analysis indicates that practically all gene expression regulated by TAg in enterocytes is dependent upon its binding and inactivation of the Rb family proteins. To further dissect the role of the Rb family in the induction of intestinal hyperplasia, we have screened several lines of transgenic mice expressing a truncated TAg (TAg(N136)), which is able to interfere with the Rb pathway but lacks the functions associated with the carboxy terminus of the protein. This analysis confirmed the pivotal association between the Rb pathway and the induction of intestinal hyperplasia and revealed that upregulation of p53 target genes is not associated with the tumorigenic phenotype. Furthermore, we found that TAg(N136) was sufficient to induce intestinal hyperplasia, although the appearance of dysplasia was significantly delayed.
