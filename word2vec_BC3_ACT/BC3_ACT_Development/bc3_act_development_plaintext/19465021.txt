We report here the functional analysis of human Regulator of Ribosome Synthesis 1 (RRS1) protein during mitosis. We demonstrate that RRS1 localizes in the nucleolus during interphase and is distributed at the chromosome periphery during mitosis. RNA interference experiments revealed that RRS1-depleted cells show abnormalities in chromosome alignment and spindle organization, which result in mitotic delay. RRS1 knockdown also perturbs the centromeric localization of Shugoshin 1 and results in premature separation of sister chromatids. Our results suggest that a nucleolar protein RRS1 contributes to chromosome congression.
