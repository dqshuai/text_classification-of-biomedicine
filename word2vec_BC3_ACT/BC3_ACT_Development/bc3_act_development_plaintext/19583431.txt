Carborane-based pincers: synthesis and structure of SeBSe and SBS Pd(II) complexes.

AM Spokoyny, MG Reuter, CL Stern, MA Ratner, T Seideman, CA Mirkin

We report the synthesis of several unique, boron-rich pincer complexes derived from m-carborane. The SeBSe and SBS pincer ligands can be synthesized via two independent synthetic routes and are metalated with Pd(II). These structures represent unique coordinating motifs, each with a Pd-B(2) bond chelated by two thio- or selenoether ligands. This class of structures serves as the first example of boron-metal pincer complexes and possesses several interesting electronic properties imposed by the m-carborane cage.
