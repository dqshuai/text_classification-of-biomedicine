The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) triggers production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells via the AtrbohD and AtrbohF NADPH oxidases, leading to stomatal closure. The ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinase open stomata 1 (OST1) (SRK2E/SnRK2.6) acts upstream of ROS in guard cell ABA signaling. Here, we report that OST1 phosphorylates Ser13 and Ser174 on AtrbohF. In addition, substitution of Ser174 to Ala results in a approximately 40% reduction in the phosphorylation of AtrbohF by OST1. We also show that OST1 physically interacts with AtrbohF. These results provide biochemical evidence suggesting that OST1 regulates AtrbohF activity.
