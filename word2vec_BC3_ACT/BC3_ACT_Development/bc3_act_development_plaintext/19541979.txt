Comment on "Experimental test of self-shielding in vacuum ultraviolet photodissociation of CO".

SR Federman, ED Young

Chakraborty et al. (Reports, 5 September 2008, p. 1328) suggested that experimental results provide support for CO photodissociation having caused the oxygen isotope ratio associated with the early solar nebula. We point out that further analysis is required before other mechanisms, such as self-shielding, are shown to be of little importance.
