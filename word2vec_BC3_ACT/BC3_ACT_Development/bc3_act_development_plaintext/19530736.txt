Conjugated polymer sensors built on pi-extended borasiloxane cages.

W Liu, M Pink, D Lee

An efficient 2 + 2 cyclocondensation with dihydroxysilane converted simple arylboronic acids to bifunctional borasiloxane cage molecules, which were subsequently electropolymerized to furnish air-stable thin films. The extended [p,pi]-conjugation that defines the rigid backbone of this new conjugated polymer (CP) motif gives rise to longer-wavelength UV-vis transitions upon oxidative doping, the spectral window and intensity of which can be modified by interaction with Lewis basic reagents. Notably, this boron-containing CP undergoes a rapid and reversible color change from green to orange upon exposure to volatile amine samples under ambient conditions. This direct naked-eye detection scheme can best be explained by invoking the reversible B-N dative bond formation that profoundly influences the p-pi* orbital overlap.
