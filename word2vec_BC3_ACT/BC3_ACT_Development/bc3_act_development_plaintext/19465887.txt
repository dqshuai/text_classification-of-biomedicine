Ubiquitination regulates membrane events such as endocytosis, membrane trafficking and endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Although the involvement of membrane-associated ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and ligases in these processes is well documented, their regulation by ubiquitin deconjugases is less well understood. By screening a database of human deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), we have identified a putative transmembrane domain in ubiquitin-specific protease (USP)19. We show that USP19 is a tail-anchored ubiquitin-specific protease localized to the ER and is a target of the unfolded protein response. USP19 rescues the ERAD substrates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)DeltaF508 and T-cell receptor-alpha (TCRalpha) from proteasomal degradation. A catalytically inactive USP19 was still able to partly rescue TCRalpha but not CFTRDeltaF508, suggesting that USP19 might also exert a non-catalytic function on specific ERAD substrates. Thus, USP19 is the first example of a membrane-anchored DUB involved in the turnover of ERAD substrates.
