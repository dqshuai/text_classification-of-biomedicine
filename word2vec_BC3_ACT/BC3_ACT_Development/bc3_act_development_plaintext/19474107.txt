The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a multifunctional protein that plays a crucial role in virus infectivity. In this study, using the mesogenic strain Beaudette C (BC), we mutated three conserved amino acids thought to be part of the binding/catalytic active site in the HN protein. We also mutated five additional residues near the proposed active site that are nonconserved between BC and the avirulent strain LaSota. The eight recovered NDV HN mutants were assessed for effects on biological activities. While most of the mutations had surprisingly little effect, mutation at conserved residue Y526 reduced the neuraminidase, receptor binding, and fusion activities and attenuated viral virulence in eggs and young birds.
