Endothelial phenotypes are highly regulated in space and time by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. There is increasing evidence that the GATA family of transcription factors function as signal transducers, coupling changes in the extracellular environment to changes in downstream target gene expression. Here we show that human primary endothelial cells derived from large blood vessels express GATA2, -3, and -6. Of these factors, GATA3 was expressed at the highest levels. In DNA microarrays of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of GATA3 resulted in reduced expression of genes associated with angiogenesis, including Tie2. At a functional level, GATA3 knockdown inhibited angiopoietin (Ang)-1-mediated but not vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF)-mediated AKT signaling, cell migration, survival, and tube formation. In electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation, GATA3 was shown to bind to regulatory regions within the 5'-untranslated region of the Tie2 gene. In co-immunoprecipitation and co-transfection assays, GATA3 and the Ets transcription factor, ELF1, physically interacted and synergized to transactivate the Tie2 promoter. GATA3 knockdown blocked the ability of Ang-1 to attenuate vascular endothelial cell growth factor stimulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression and monocytic cell adhesion. Moreover, exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to tumor necrosis factor-alpha resulted in marked down-regulation of GATA3 expression and reduction in Tie2 expression. Together, these findings suggest that GATA3 is indispensable for Ang-1-Tie2-mediated signaling in large vessel endothelial cells.
