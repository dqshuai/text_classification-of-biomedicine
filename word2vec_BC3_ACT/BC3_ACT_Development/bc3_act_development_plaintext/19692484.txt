1,25(OH)2D3 decreases parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene transcription through the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Total body VDR(-/-) mice have high PTH levels, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and bone malformations. To investigate PTH regulation by the VDR specifically in the parathyroid, we generated parathyroid-specific VDR knockout mice (PT-VDR(-/-)). In both strains, there was a decrease in parathyroid calcium receptor (CaR) levels. The number of proliferating parathyroid cells was increased in the VDR(-/-) mice but not in the PT-VDR(-/-) mice. Serum PTH levels were moderately but significantly increased in the PT-VDR(-/-) mice with normal serum calcium levels. The sensitivity of the parathyroid glands of the PT-VDR(-/-) mice to calcium was intact as measured by serum PTH levels after changes in serum calcium. This indicates that the reduced CaR in the PT-VDR(-/-) mice enables a physiologic response to serum calcium. Serum C-terminal collagen crosslinks, a marker of bone resorption, were increased in the PT-VDR(-/-) mice with no change in the bone formation marker, serum osteocalcin, consistent with a resorptive effect due to the increased serum PTH levels in the PT-VDR(-/-) mice. Therefore, deletion of the VDR specifically in the parathyroid decreases parathyroid CaR expression and only moderately increases basal PTH levels, suggesting that the VDR has a limited role in parathyroid physiology.
