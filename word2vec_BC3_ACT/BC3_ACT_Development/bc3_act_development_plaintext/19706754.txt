Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma are two aggressive cancers that affect bones and soft tissues in children and adolescents. Despite multimodal therapy, patients with metastatic sarcoma have a poor prognosis, emphasizing a need for more effective treatment. We have shown previously that 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME), an antitumoral compound, induces apoptosis in Ewing sarcoma cells through c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. In the present study, we provide evidence that 2-ME elicits macroautophagy, a process that participates in apoptotic responses, in a JNK-dependent manner, in Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma cells. We also found that the enhanced activation of JNK by 2-ME is partially regulated by p53, highlighting the relationship of JNK and autophagy to p53 signaling pathway. Furthermore, we showed that 2-ME up-regulates damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM), a p53 target gene, in Ewing sarcoma cells through a mechanism that involves JNK activation. The silencing of DRAM expression reduced both apoptosis and autophagy triggered by 2-ME in Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma cells. Our results therefore identify JNK as a novel mediator of DRAM regulation. These findings suggest that 2-ME or other anticancer therapies that increase DRAM expression or function could be used to effectively treat sarcoma patients.
