Extensive alteration of gene expression and metabolic remodeling enable the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to ensure cellular homeostasis and adaptation to heat shock. The response logic of the cells to heat shock is still not entirely clear. In this study, we combined the expression profiles with metabolic pathways to investigate the logical relations between heat shock response metabolic pathways. The results showed that the heat-stressed S. cerevisiae cell accumulated trehalose and glycogen, which protect cellular proteins against denaturation, and modulate its phospholipid structure to sustain stability of the cell wall. The TCA cycle was enhanced, and the heat shock-induced turnover of amino acids and nucleotides served to meet the extra energy requirement due to heat-induced protein metabolism and modification. The enhanced respiration led to oxidative stress, and subsequently induced the aldehyde detoxification system. These results indicated that new insight into the response logic of S. cerevisiae to heat shock can be gained by integrating expression profiles and the logical relations between heat shock response metabolic pathways.
