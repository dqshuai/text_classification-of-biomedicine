By combination of Nb(5+) (having a d(0) electronic configuration) and the lone-pair-containing iodate anion, a new SHG material, BaNbO(IO(3))(5), has been prepared. It exhibits a very large SHG response (approximately 14 times that of KH(2)PO(4) and approximately 660 times that of alpha-SiO(2)) and is phase-matchable. The material has high thermal stability and a wide transparent region.
