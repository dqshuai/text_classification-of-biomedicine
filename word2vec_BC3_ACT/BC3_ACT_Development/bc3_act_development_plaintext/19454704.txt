Identification of an IFN-gamma-producing neutrophil early in the response to Listeria monocytogenes.

J Yin, TA Ferguson

IFN-gamma plays a critical role during the immune response to infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Early in the innate response NK cells are thought to be a primary source of IFN-gamma; however, protection can be mediated by the presence of significant numbers of primed IFN-gamma-secreting CD8(+) T cells. In this report, we examined the early response to Listeria and found that 18 h after infection spleens contain CD11b(+), Gr-1(high), or Ly6G(+) cells that produce significant IFN-gamma. Morphological analysis of sorted Gr-1(high)IFN-gamma(+) and Gr-1(low)IFN-gamma(+) or Ly6G(+)IFN-gamma(+) cells confirmed that these cells were neutrophils. The importance of IFN-gamma production by these cells was further tested using adoptive transfer studies. Transfer of purified neutrophils from Ifng(+/+) mice led to increased bacterial clearance in Ifng(-/-) mice. Transfer of Ifng(-/-) neutrophils provided no such protection. We conclude that neutrophils are an early source of IFN-gamma during Listeria infection and are important in providing immune protection.
