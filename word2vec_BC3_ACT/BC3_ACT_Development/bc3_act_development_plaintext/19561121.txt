Turnover of fatty acids during natural senescence of Arabidopsis, Brachypodium, and switchgrass and in Arabidopsis beta-oxidation mutants.

Z Yang, JB Ohlrogge

During leaf senescence, macromolecule breakdown occurs and nutrients are translocated to support growth of new vegetative tissues, seeds, or other storage organs. In this study, we determined the fatty acid levels and profiles in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), Brachypodium distachyon, and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) leaves during natural senescence. In young leaves, fatty acids represent 4% to 5% of dry weight and approximately 10% of the chemical energy content of the leaf tissues. In all three species, fatty acid levels in leaves began to decline at the onset of leaf senescence and progressively decreased as senescence advanced, resulting in a greater than 80% decline in fatty acids on a dry weight basis. During senescence, Arabidopsis leaves lost 1.6% of fatty acids per day at a rate of 2.1 mug per leaf (0.6 mug mg(-1) dry weight). Triacylglycerol levels remained less than 1% of total lipids at all stages. In contrast to glycerolipids, aliphatic surface waxes of Arabidopsis leaves were much more stable, showing only minor reduction during senescence. We also examined three Arabidopsis mutants, acx1acx2, lacs6lacs7, and kat2, which are blocked in enzyme activities of beta-oxidation and are defective in lipid mobilization during seed germination. In each case, no major differences in the fatty acid contents of leaves were observed between these mutants and the wild type, indicating that several mutations in beta-oxidation that cause reduced breakdown of reserve oil in seeds do not substantially reduce the degradation of fatty acids during leaf senescence.
