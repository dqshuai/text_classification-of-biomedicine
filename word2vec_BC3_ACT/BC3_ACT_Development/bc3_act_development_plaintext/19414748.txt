We report on a novel approach aimed at preventing acute vascular rejection (AVR), one of the major unresolved hurdles of clinical transplantation. In a C3H-to-BALB/c heterotopic heart transplant model, we demonstrate that free bone transplantation combined with cyclosporin A suppresses antidonor Ab responses, induces indefinite cardiac allograft survival (>100 days), and preserves graft architecture. In contrast, untreated- or cyclosporin A alone-treated recipients rejected their cardiac grafts on days 7.7 +/- 0.6 and 15.5 +/- 1.1, respectively, with graft histology indicative of AVR. Splenic dendritic cells from nonrejecting recipients expressed low levels of MHC II, CD40, and CD86, reduced ability to stimulate donor cell proliferation, and augmented IL-10 production of responding T cells in vitro. Adoptive transfer of dendritic cells from long-term surviving recipients 1 day before cardiac grafting was able to confer hyporesponsiveness to naive BALB/c recipients of cardiac allografts. To determine whether graft survival was associated with hematopoietic or stromal elements of the transplanted free bone, we administered isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells or free bone that was irradiated to deplete hematopoietic elements. Although bone marrow mononuclear cells had no effect on cardiac graft survival, irradiated free bone transplantation was capable of prolonging graft survival. Most interestingly, the prolongation effect was Ag nonspecific, because third party irradiated bone graft was also effective. Due to the fact that current immunosuppressive approaches are clinically ineffective at preventing AVR, this study provides promise for further investigations of BM components as a means of addressing a currently unmet medical need.
