On the basis of the previously reported clinical candidate, SSA-426 (1), a series of related 2-piperazin-1-ylquinoline derivatives 3-16 were synthesized and evaluated as dual-acting serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and 5-HT1A receptor antagonists. In particular, compound 7 exhibits potent functional activities at both the 5-HT transporter and 5-HT1A receptor, good selectivity over the alpha1-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors, acceptable pharmacokinetic properties, and a favorable in vivo profile.
