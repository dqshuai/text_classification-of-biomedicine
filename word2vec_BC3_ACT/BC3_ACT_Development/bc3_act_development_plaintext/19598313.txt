Different modalities of arterial reconstruction in hepatic retransplantation using right partial graft.

Though split-liver and living-related transplantation are routinely performed, they are done almost exclusively for primary liver transplantation because of potential surgical difficulties. These difficulties are generally related to arterial revascularization, particularly if there is hepatic artery thrombosis. According to UNOS data, of the hepatic retransplantations performed between 1996 and 2007, only 8.7% were done using right or extended right grafts from deceased donors, and 14.3% using right grafts from live donors. Here we report our experience with 5 hepatic retransplantations in which right partial grafts resulting from conventional in situ splits, and one right lobe resulting from an adult-to-adult living-related transplant, were successfully used with different modalities of graft arterialization.
