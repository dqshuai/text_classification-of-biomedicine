IL-17A controls IL-17F production and maintains blood neutrophil counts in mice.

S von Vietinghoff, K Ley

G-CSF, its receptor, and IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) are all required to maintain baseline neutrophil counts in mice. In this study, we tested whether IL-17F could compensate and maintain baseline neutrophil counts in the absence of IL-17A. Unlike the reduced neutrophil counts found in IL-17RA-deficient mice, neutrophil counts were mildly increased in IL-17A-deficient (Il17a(-/-)) animals. There was no evidence for infection or altered neutrophil function. Plasma G-CSF and IL-17F levels were elevated in Il17a(-/-) compared with wild-type mice. IL-17F was mainly produced in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, but IL-23 was unaltered in Il17a(-/-) mice. Instead, Il17a(-/-) splenocytes differentiated with IL-6, TGF-beta, and IL-23 ex vivo produced significantly more IL-17F in response to IL-23 than wild-type cells. Adding rIL-17A to Il17a(-/-) splenocyte cultures reduced IL-17F mRNA and protein secretion. These effects were also observed in wild-type but not IL-17RA-deficient cells. We conclude that IL-17A mediated suppression of IL-17F production and secretion requires IL-17RA and is relevant to maintain the normal set point of blood neutrophil counts in vivo.
