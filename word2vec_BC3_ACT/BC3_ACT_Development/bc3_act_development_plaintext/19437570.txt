Jejunoileal bypass: a surgery of the past and a review of its complications.

D Singh, AS Laya, WK Clarkston, MJ Allen

Jejunoileal bypass (JIB), popular in the 1960s and 1970s, had remarkable success in achieving weight loss by creating a surgical short bowel syndrome. Our patient had an unusual case of liver disease and provided no history of prior bariatric surgery. Later, it was recognized that he had a JIB in the 1970s, which was also responsible for the gamut of his illnesses. Patients with JIB are often not recognized, as they died of complications, or underwent reversal of their surgery or a liver-kidney transplant. Early identification with prompt reversal, and the recognition and treatment of the life-threatening consequences play a critical role in the management of such patients.
