Amonafide, a naphthalimide derivative, although selected for exploratory clinical trials for its potent anticancer activity, has long been challenged by its unpredictable side effects. In the present study, a novel amonafide analogue, M(2)-A 2-(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-6-(thiophene-2-ylmethylamino)-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione was ascribed to its potent effects on topoisomerase IIalpha. Moreover, our investigation indicates that M(2)-A induces G(2)/M phase growth arrest through inhibiting PI3K/Akt pathway. M(2)-A inhibits proliferation of HeLa, HL60, HCT-8, A375, MCF-7 and MRC-5 cells, especially inhibits proliferation of HL60 with an IC(50) value of 18.86 microM. M(2)-A can not only induce DNA fragmentation, but also enhance Annexin V-FITC binding of the cells. On the one hand the expression levels of protein Cyclin B1, Cdk1 changed in response to M(2)-A treatment in HL60 cells. On the other hand we observed the inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2, the caspase -3, -9 activity increase in HL60 cells after treated with M(2)-A, which indicated that the mitochondrial pathway was involved in the apoptosis signal pathway. Our results showed that the phosphorylation of p85/PI3K and Akt decreased following M(2)-A treatment. In summary, M(2)-A displayed a significant anti-tumor effect through cell cycle arrest and apoptotic induction in HL60 cells, which suggested that M(2)-A might have therapeutic potential against leukaemia.
