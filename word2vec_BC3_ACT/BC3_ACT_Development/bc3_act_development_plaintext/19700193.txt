We have previously proposed that mammalian lipocalin allergens are recognized suboptimally by the human immune system due to their homology with endogenous lipocalins. Here, we have characterized in detail the human T cell recognition of one of the previously identified T cell epitopes of the major dog allergen Can f 1, contained in peptide p105-120. A panel of peptide analogues (altered peptide ligands, APLs) of p105-120 was tested on two specific T cell clones restricted by different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. Interestingly, we identified for both of the clones several heteroclitic APLs that were capable of stimulating them at 10-30-fold lower concentrations than the natural peptide. Moreover, one of the heteroclitic APLs identified with the T cell clones, L115F, was observed to induce a stronger polyclonal T cell response than the natural allergen peptide from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of six Can f 1-allergic subjects studied. The heteroclitic APLs bound with the same affinity as p105-120 to common HLA-DR- and HLA-DP-alleles, suggesting that their improved stimulatory capacity is attributable to a more efficient T cell receptor (TCR) recognition rather than increased HLA binding. Collectively, our data suggest that p105-120 is recognized suboptimally by human T cells. This may contribute to the allergenicity of Can f 1.
