We report here on the successful oxidation of element 102, nobelium (No), on an atom-at-a-time scale in 0.1 M alpha-hydroxyisobutyric acid (alpha-HIB) solution using a newly developed technique, flow electrolytic column chromatography. It is found that the most stable ion, No(2+), is oxidized to No(3+) within 3 min and that the oxidized No complex with alpha-HIB holds the trivalent state in the column above an applied potential of 1.0 V.
