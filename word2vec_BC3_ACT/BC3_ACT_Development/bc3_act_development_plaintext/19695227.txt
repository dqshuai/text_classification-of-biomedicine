Artefacts in cell culture: pyruvate as a scavenger of hydrogen peroxide generated by ascorbate or epigallocatechin gallate in cell culture media.

LH Long, B Halliwell

Ascorbate and several phenolic compounds readily oxidise in cell culture media to generate hydrogen peroxide. However, media containing pyruvate showed much less H(2)O(2) production, apparently because pyruvate can scavenge H(2)O(2) in the medium. Researchers must be aware that compounds under test can sometimes readily oxidise in cell culture media, that this might not be detected by measurement of H(2)O(2) if the media contain pyruvate, and that pyruvate can be substantially depleted in the media as a result.
