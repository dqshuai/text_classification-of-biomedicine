BACKGROUND: Few cohort studies have investigated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection before the occurrence of gastric cancer. METHODS: Among 14,440 cohort participants, 100 incident gastric cancer cases were individually matched to two controls. Epstein-Barr virus antibodies IgG and IgA against viral capsid antigen (VCA), EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibody IgG, and early antigen (EA) antibody IgG were measured using enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). RESULTS: The highest titres of VCA IgG (odds ratio (OR): 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62-3.06) or EBNA IgG (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.51-1.46) were not associated with gastric cancer risk. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of VCA IgG or EBNA IgG were not associated with increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma in Koreans.
