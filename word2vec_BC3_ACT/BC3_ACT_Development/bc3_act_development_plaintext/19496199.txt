Ampullary carcinoma is the second most common cancer of the peri-ampullary area after pancreatic carcinoma and metastasizes mostly intra-abdominally and to the liver. Extra-abdominal metastases are less frequent. In this report we describe the case of a patient with resected adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater who developed skeletal metastases in the lower extremity and brain metastases. We briefly discuss aspects of this comparatively rare gastrointestinal malignancy.
