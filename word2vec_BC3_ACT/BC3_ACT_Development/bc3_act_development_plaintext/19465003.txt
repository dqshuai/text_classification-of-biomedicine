Angiotensin II is critically involved in skin wound healing, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study investigated the effect of angiotensin II on type I collagen gene activation in human dermal fibroblasts and the possible mechanism involved. Angiotensin II stimulated the mRNA and protein expression of type I collagen and TGF-beta1. Effects were abolished by the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist ZD7155 but not by the AT2 blocker PD123319. Blockade of TGF-beta1 markedly inhibited angiotensin II-induced type I collagen gene expression. Activator protein-1 (AP-1) decoy ODNs transfection suppressed angiotensin II-induced TGF-beta1 expression, and also, diminished type I collagen expression. These data indicated that angiotensin II induces collagen gene activation in human dermal fibroblasts through an AT1-mediated AP-1/TGF-beta1 signaling pathway.
