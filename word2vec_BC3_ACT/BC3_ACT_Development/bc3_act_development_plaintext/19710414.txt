PURPOSE: One strategy to minimize bacteria-associated adverse responses such as microbial keratitis, contact lens-induced acute red eye (CLARE), and contact lens induced peripheral ulcers (CLPUs) that occur with contact lens wear is the development of an antimicrobial or antiadhesive contact lens. Cationic peptides represent a novel approach for the development of antimicrobial lenses. METHODS: A novel cationic peptide, melimine, was covalently incorporated into silicone hydrogel lenses. Confirmation tests to determine the presence of peptide and anti-microbial activity were performed. Cationic lenses were then tested for their ability to prevent CLPU in the Staphylococcus aureus rabbit model and CLARE in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa guinea pig model. RESULTS: In the rabbit model of CLPU, melimine-coated lenses resulted in significant reductions in ocular symptom scores and in the extent of corneal infiltration (P < 0.05). Evaluation of the performance of melimine lenses in the CLARE model showed significant improvement in all ocular response parameters measured, including the percentage of eyes with corneal infiltrates, compared with those observed in the eyes fitted with the control lens (P < or = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Cationic coating of contact lenses with the peptide melimine may represent a novel method of prevention of bacterial growth on contact lenses and consequently result in reduction of the incidence and severity of adverse responses due to Gram-positive and -negative bacteria during lens wear.
