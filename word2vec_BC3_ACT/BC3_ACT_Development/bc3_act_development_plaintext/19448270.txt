Evolutionary strata in a small mating-type-specific region of the smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum.

AA Votintseva, DA Filatov

DNA sequence analysis and genetic mapping of loci from mating-type-specific chromosomes of the smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum demonstrated that the nonrecombining mating-type-specific region in this species comprises approximately 25% ( approximately 1 Mb) of the chromosome length. Divergence between homologous mating-type-linked genes in this region varies between 0 and 8.6%, resembling the evolutionary strata of vertebrate and plant sex chromosomes.
