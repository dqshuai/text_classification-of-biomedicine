Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase belongs to the subfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR), and 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase catalyzes the interconversion of inactive glucocorticoids (cortisone in human, dehydrocorticosterone in rodents) and active glucocorticoids (cortisol in human, corticosterone in rodents). We report here the cloning and characterization of a novel human SDR gene SCDR10B which encodes a protein with similarity to 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1. SCDR10B was isolated from a human brain cDNA library, and was mapped to chromosome 19p13.3 by browsing the UCSC genomic database. It contains an ORF with a length of 858 bp, encoding a protein with a transmembrane helix and SDR domain. Its molecular mass and isoelectric point are predicted to be 30.8 kDa and 10.3 kDa, respectively. SCDR10B protein is highly conserved in mammals and fish. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that SCDR10B stands for a new subgroup in the 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family. Northern blot analysis showed that SCDR10B was highly expressed in brain, and a strong expression signal was detected in hippocampal neurons by immunohistochemical analysis. RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis showed that SCDR10B was up-regulated in lung-cancer cell lines and human lung cancer. SCDR10B can catalyze the dehydrogenation of cortisol in the presence of NADP(+), and therefore it is a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
