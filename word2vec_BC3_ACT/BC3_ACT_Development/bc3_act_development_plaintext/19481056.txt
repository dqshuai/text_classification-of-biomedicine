The postsynaptic density (PSD) is a highly specialized structure that is located juxtaposed to the presynaptic active zone of excitatory synapses. It is composed of a variety of proteins that include receptors, signaling molecules, cytoskeletal components and scaffolding proteins. ProSAP/Shank proteins are large multidomain proteins that facilitate multiple functions within the PSD. They build large scaffolds that are the structural basis for the direct and/or indirect connection between receptor proteins and the actin based cytoskeleton. Here, we characterize a novel interaction partner of ProSAP2/Shank3, named ProSAP interacting protein 2 (ProSAPiP2) that does not show any close homology to other known proteins. It binds to the PDZ domain of ProSAP2/Shank3 and is highly expressed in the neuronal system. ProSAPiP2 is located in dendrites and spines, is enriched in the PSD and interacts with actin. Therefore ProSAPiP2 could be involved in the linkage between molecules of the PSD and the cytoskeleton.
