Arabidopsis cortical microtubules are initiated along, as well as branching from, existing microtubules.

The principles by which cortical microtubules self-organize into a global template hold important implications for cell wall patterning. Microtubules move along bundles of microtubules, and neighboring bundles tend to form mobile domains that flow in a common direction. The bundles themselves move slowly and for longer than the individual microtubules, with domains describing slow rotary patterns. Despite this tendency for colinearity, microtubules have been seen to branch off extant microtubules at approximately 45 degrees . To examine this paradoxical behavior, we investigated whether some microtubules may be born on and grow along extant microtubule(s). The plus-end markers Arabidopsis thaliana end binding protein 1a, AtEB1a-GFP, and Arabidopsis SPIRAL1, SPR1-GFP, allowed microtubules of known polarity to be distinguished from underlying microtubules. This showed that the majority of microtubules do branch but in a direction heavily biased toward the plus end of the mother microtubule: few grow backward, consistent with the common polarity of domains. However, we also found that a significant proportion of emergent comets do follow the axes of extant microtubules, both at sites of apparent microtubule nucleation and at cross-over points. These phenomena help explain the persistence of bundles and counterbalance the tendency to branch.
