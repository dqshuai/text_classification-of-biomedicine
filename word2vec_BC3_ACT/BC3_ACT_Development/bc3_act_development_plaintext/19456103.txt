Nanodiscs are phospholipid-protein complexes which are relevant to nascent high-density lipoprotein and are applicable as a drug carrier and a tool to immobilize membrane proteins. We evaluated the structure and dynamics of the nanoparticles consisting of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) with small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and fluorescence methods and compared them with static/dynamic properties for large unilamellar vesicles. SANS revealed that the nanodisc includes a lipid bilayer with a thickness of 44 A and a radius of 37 A, in which each lipid occupies a smaller area than the reported molecular area of DMPC in vesicles. Fluorescence measurements suggested that DMPC possesses a lower entropy in nanodiscs than in vesicles, because apoA-I molecules, which surround the bilayer, force closer lipid packing, but allow water penetration to the acyl chain ends. Time-resolved SANS experiments revealed that nanodiscs represent a 20-fold higher lipid transfer via an entropically favorable process. The results put forward a conjunction of static/dynamic properties of nanodiscs, where the entropic constraints are responsible for the accelerated desorption of lipids.
