Toll-like receptors and innate immunity.

H Kumar, T Kawai, S Akira

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are evolutionarily conserved innate receptors expressed in various immune and non-immune cells of the mammalian host. TLRs play a crucial role in defending against pathogenic microbial infection through the induction of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. Furthermore, TLRs also play roles in shaping pathogen-specific humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses. In this review, we describe the recent advances in pathogen recognition by TLRs and TLR signaling.
