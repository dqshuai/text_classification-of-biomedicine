Oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in the pathogenesis of many age-related diseases. We have demonstrated previously that oxidative inactivation of the proteasome is a molecular link between oxidative stress and overexpression of interleukin (IL)-8. Here, we elucidated a novel signaling cascade that leads to up-regulation of IL-8 in response to proteasome inactivation. The sequence of events in this cascade includes proteasome inactivation, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK)3/MKK6, activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation and increased IL-8 expression. Blocking any of these signaling pathways abolished the up-regulation of IL-8 induced by proteasome inhibition. Although Akt is also activated in response to proteasome inactivation, we found that the PI3K-dependent up-regulation of IL-8 is independent of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK)1 and Akt. Inhibition of PDK1 and Akt with chemical inhibitors or expression of constitutive active Akt had little effects on IL-8 expression in response to proteasome inactivation. In contrast, inhibition of interleukin 2-inducible T cell kinase, a kinase downstream of PI3K, significantly reduced the expression and secretion of IL-8 in response to proteasome inactivation. Together, these data elucidate a novel signaling network that leads to increased IL-8 production in response to proteasome inactivation.
