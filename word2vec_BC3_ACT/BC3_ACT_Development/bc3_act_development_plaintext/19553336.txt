Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the etiological agent of bluetongue, a hemorrhagic disease of ruminants (particularly sheep), which causes important economic losses around the world. BTV is transmitted primarily via the bites of infected midges, which inject the virus into the ruminant's skin during blood feeding. The virus initially replicates in the draining lymph node and then disseminates to secondary organs where it induces edema, hemorrhages, and necrosis. In this study, we show that ovine conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are the primary targets of BTV that contribute to the primary dissemination of BTV from the skin to draining lymph nodes. Lymph cDCs support BTV RNA and protein synthesis, as well as the production of infectious virus belonging to several different BTV serotypes, regardless of their level of attenuation. Afferent lymph cell subsets, other than cDCs, showed only marginal levels of BTV protein expression. BTV infection provoked a massive recruitment of cDCs to the sheep skin and afferent lymph, providing cellular targets for infection. Although BTV productively infects cDCs, no negative impact on their physiology was detected. Indeed, BTV infection and protein expression in cDCs enhanced their survival rate. Several serotypes of BTV stimulated the surface expression of the CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules on cDCs as well as the mRNA synthesis of cytokines involved in inflammation and immunity, i.e., interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-1beta, and IL-6. BTV-infected cDCs stimulated antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 proliferation as well as gamma interferon production. BTV initially targets cDCs while preserving their functional properties, reflecting the optimal adaptation of the virus to its host cells for its first spread.
