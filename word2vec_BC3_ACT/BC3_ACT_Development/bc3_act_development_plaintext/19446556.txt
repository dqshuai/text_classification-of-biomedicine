A full-length cDNA encoding an anticoagulant peptide, named AduNAP4, was cloned and identified from the human hookworm Ancylostoma duodenale. AduNAP4 has 104 amino acids including a predicted 23-residue signal peptide and shows <or= 50% similarity with other known nematode anticoagulant protein/peptide (NAP). AduNAP4 is extremely efficient at prolonging the activated partial thromboplastin time, and is an inhibitor of both fXa (K(i)=7.34+/-1.74 nM) and fXIa (K(i)=42.45+/-3.25 nM). No fXIa inhibitor has previously been described from other blood-feeding animals. Our results suggest that hookworms have evolved a potent mechanism that interferes with coagulation by inhibition of fXIa to facilitate its blood-feeding lifestyle.
