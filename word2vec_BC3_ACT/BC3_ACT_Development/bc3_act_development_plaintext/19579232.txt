MS was used to characterize the 24 kDa human growth hormone (hGH) glycoprotein isoform and determine the locus of O-linked oligosaccharide attachment, the oligosaccharide branching topology, and the monosaccharide sequence. MALDI-TOF/MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses of glycosylated 24 kDa hGH tryptic peptides showed that this hGH isoform is a product of the hGH normal gene. Analysis of the glycoprotein hydrolysate by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection and HPLC with fluorescent detection for N-acetyl neuraminic acid (NeuAc) yielded the oligosaccharide composition (NeuAc(2), N-acetyl galactosamine(1), Gal(1)). After beta-elimination to release the oligosaccharide from glycosylated 24 kDa hGH, collision-induced dissociation of tryptic glycopeptide T6 indicated that there had been an O-linked oligosaccharide attached to Thr-60. The sequence and branching structure of the oligosaccharide were determined by ESI-MS/MS analysis of tryptic glycopeptide T6. The mucin-like O-oligosaccharide sequence linked to Thr-60 begins with N-acetyl galactosamine and branches in a bifurcated topology with one appendage consisting of galactose followed by NeuAc and the other consisting of a single NeuAc. The oligosaccharide moiety lies in the high-affinity binding site 1 structural epitope of hGH that interfaces with both the growth hormone and the prolactin receptors and is predicted to sterically affect receptor interactions and alter the biological actions of hGH.
