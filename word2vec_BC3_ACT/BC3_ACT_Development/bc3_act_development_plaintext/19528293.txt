The role of aneuploidy in promoting and suppressing tumors.

BA Weaver, DW Cleveland

Impaired mitotic checkpoint signaling can both promote and suppress tumors. The mitotic checkpoint targets Cdc20, the specificity factor of the ubiquitin ligase that promotes anaphase by targeting cyclin B and securin for destruction. In this issue, Li et al. (2009. J. Cell Biol. doi:10.1083/jcb.200904020) use gene replacement to produce mice expressing a Cdc20 mutant that cannot be inhibited by the mitotic checkpoint. In addition to the expected aneuploidy, these animals have a high tumor incidence that is likely caused by persistent aneuploidy coupled with nonmitotic functions of mutant Cdc20.
