Improvement of Stearidonic acid production in Oleaginous Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Rat Delta6 desaturase was introduced in "oleaginous" Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetically modified by the snf2 disruption, DGA1 overexpression, and LEU2 expression to improve stearidonic acid (18:4n-3 (Delta6, 9, 12, 15)) production. When this transformed yeast was cultured in the presence of 0.7 g/l alpha-linolenic acid for 7 d, 0.4 g of alpha-linolenic acid was accumulated and 44 mg of stearidonic acid was produced, mainly as a triacylglycerol in the 1 liter broth.
