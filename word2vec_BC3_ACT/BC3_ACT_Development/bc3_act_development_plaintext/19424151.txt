The recent discovery of superconductivity in oxypnictides with a critical transition temperature (T(C)) higher than the McMillan limit of 39 K (the theoretical maximum predicted by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory) has generated great excitement. Theoretical calculations indicate that the electron-phonon interaction is not strong enough to give rise to such high transition temperatures, but strong ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic fluctuations have been proposed to be responsible. Superconductivity and magnetism in pnictide superconductors, however, show a strong sensitivity to the crystal lattice, suggesting the possibility of unconventional electron-phonon coupling. Here we report the effect of oxygen and iron isotope substitution on T(C) and the spin-density wave (SDW) transition temperature (T(SDW)) in the SmFeAsO(1 - x)F(x) and Ba(1 - x)K(x)Fe(2)As(2) systems. The oxygen isotope effect on T(C) and T(SDW) is very small, while the iron isotope exponent alpha(C) = -dlnT(C)/dlnM is about 0.35 (0.5 corresponds to the full isotope effect). Surprisingly, the iron isotope exchange shows the same effect on T(SDW) as T(C). This indicates that electron-phonon interaction plays some role in the superconducting mechanism, but a simple electron-phonon coupling mechanism seems unlikely because a strong magnon-phonon coupling is included.
