Iridium-N,P-ligand-catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation of diphenylvinylphosphine oxides and vinylphosphonates.

Diphenylvinylphosphine oxides and di- and trisubstituted vinylphosphonates have been employed as substrates in iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenations. Complete conversions and excellent enantioselectivities (up to and above 99% ee) were observed for a range of substrates with both aromatic and aliphatic groups at the prochiral carbon. We have also hydrogenated electron-deficient carboxyethylvinylphosphonates with excellent stereoselectivity (up to and above 99% ee). The hydrogenated products of both classes of substrates are synthetically useful intermediates.
