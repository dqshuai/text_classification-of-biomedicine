Mechanism and regulatory function of CpG signaling via scavenger receptor B1 in primary B cells.

It is well established that CpG promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine and antibody production by B cells via the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)-dependent pathway. However, scavenger receptors (SRs) are also capable of binding such pathogen-derived molecules, yet their contribution to CpG-induced signaling events has not yet been evaluated. Here we identified a novel TLR9-independent mechanism of CpG-induced signaling and immune function that is mediated by the scavenger B1 receptor (SR-B1). Specifically, we show that CpG/SR-B1 triggers calcium entry into primary B lymphocytes via phospholipase C gamma-1-mediated activation of TRPC3 channels and also B cell adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. CpG-induced calcium signals and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 adhesion are TLR9-independent and are mediated exclusively by SR-B1. Although pro-inflammatory cytokine and Ig production induced by CpG require TLR9 expression, we also found that SR-B1 negatively regulates TLR9-dependent production of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and IgM. Thus, our results provide a novel perspective on the complexity of CpG signaling within B cells by demonstrating that SR-B1 is an alternative pathway for nucleic acid-induced signaling that provides feedback inhibition on specific TLR9-dependent responses of B cells. Consequently, these results have wide implications for understanding the mechanisms regulating immune tolerance to nucleic acids and pathogen-associated molecules.
