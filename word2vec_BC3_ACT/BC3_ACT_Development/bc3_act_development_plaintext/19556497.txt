Medical innovation versus stem cell tourism.

O Lindvall, I Hyun

Stem cell tourism is criticized on grounds of consumer fraud, blatant lack of scientific justification, and patient safety.

Here we discuss these issues and articulate conditions under which "unproven" therapies may be offered to patients outside of regular clinical trials.
