PTIP regulates 53BP1 and SMC1 at the DNA damage sites.

Although PTIP is implicated in the DNA damage response, through interactions with 53BP1, the function of PTIP in the DNA damage response remain elusive. Here, we show that RNF8 controls DNA damage-induced nuclear foci formation of PTIP, which in turn regulates 53BP1 localization to the DNA damage sites. In addition, SMC1, a substrate of ATM, could not be phosphorylated at the DNA damage sites in the absence of PTIP. The PTIP-dependent pathway is important for DNA double strand breaks repair and DNA damage-induced intra-S phase checkpoint activation. Taken together, these results suggest that the role of PTIP in the DNA damage response is downstream of RNF8 and upstream of 53BP1. Thus, PTIP regulates 53BP1-dependent signaling pathway following DNA damage.
