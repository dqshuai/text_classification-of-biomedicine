Up-regulation of C-terminal tensin-like molecule promotes the tumorigenicity of colon cancer through beta-catenin.

C-terminal tensin-like (cten) is a focal adhesion molecule belonging to the tensin family. Previous studies have suggested that cten may function as a prostate-specific tumor suppressor. Here, we show that although cten is expressed at a very low level in normal colon, its expression is significantly up-regulated in colon cancer. Furthermore, a high population of cten is found in the nucleus, where it interacts with beta-catenin, a critical player in the canonical Wnt pathway. This interaction may contribute to the role of cten in enhancing the colony formation, anchorage-independent growth, and invasiveness of colon cancer cells. Our studies have identified cten as a novel nuclear partner of beta-catenin, showed an oncogenic activity of cten in colon cancers, and revealed cten as a potential biomarker and target for colon cancers.
