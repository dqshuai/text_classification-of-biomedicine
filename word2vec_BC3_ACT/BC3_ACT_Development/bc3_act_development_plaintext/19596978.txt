Airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion/overproduction/obstruction are pathophysiological characteristics of cystic fibrosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Up-regulation of airway mucin genes by inflammatory/immune response mediators is one of the major contributors to mucin overproduction. IL-8, a potent proinflammatory mediator and neutrophil chemoattractant, is present at high levels in the airway secretions of such patients. In this study, the effects of IL-8 on expression of two major airway mucin genes, MUC5AC and MUC5B, were evaluated. IL-8 increased the mRNA abundance of both mucin genes in two human respiratory tract-derived cell lines (A549 and NCI-H292) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. IL-8 also increased MUC5AC and MUC5B mRNA levels in primary normal differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells, with a high concentration of IL-8 required to increase MUC5B mRNA levels. IL-8 did not transcriptionally up-regulate MUC5AC gene expression, but rather increased the stability of the MUC5AC transcript, suggesting regulation at the posttranscriptional level. In addition, IL-8 altered the levels of RNA-binding proteins to specific domains in the 3'-untranslated region of the MUC5AC transcript. Taken together, these data indicate that the IL-8-induced binding of RNA-binding proteins to the 3'-untranslated region of MUC5AC is a potential mechanism for regulating MUC5AC gene expression at the posttranscriptional level, thus suggesting a new role whereby IL-8 sustains mucin gene expression in inflamed airways.
