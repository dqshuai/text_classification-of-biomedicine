Integrins anchor the invasive machinery.

SA Wickström, R Fässler

Cell invasion through the basement membrane, a process important for both development and disease pathogenesis, depends on an interplay of adhesive, force transducing, proteolytic, and chemotactic machineries. The mechanisms whereby these different processes are integrated on the cellular level have remained elusive. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Sherwood and coworkers now identify integrins as integration platforms for a specialized invasive membrane domain in C. elegans.
