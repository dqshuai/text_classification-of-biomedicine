Ginsenoside Rg1 protects against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells via IGF-I receptor and estrogen receptor pathways.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg1 is a novel class of potent phytoestrogen and can mimic the action of estradiol in stimulation of MCF-7 cell growth by the crosstalk between insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR)-dependent pathway and estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent pathway. The present study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside Rg1 against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and the possible mechanisms. Pre-treatment with ginsenoside Rg1 resulted in an enhancement of survival, and significant rescue occurred at the concentration of 0.01 microM on cell viability against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity. These effects could be completely blocked by IGF-IR antagonist JB-1 or ER antagonist ICI 182780. 6-OHDA arrested the cells at G(0)G(1) phase and prevented S phase entry. Rg1 pre-treatment could reverse the cytostatic effect of 6-OHDA. Ginsenoside Rg1 also could attenuate 6-OHDA-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. These effects could also be completely blocked by JB-1 or ICI 182780. Furthermore, 6-OHDA-induced up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression could be restored by Rg1 pre-treatment. Rg1 pre-treatment could reverse the down-regulation of ER alpha protein expression induced by 6-OHDA treatment. Cells transfected with the estrogen responsive element (ERE)-luciferase reporter construct exhibited significantly increased ERE-luciferase activity in the Rg1 presence, suggesting that the estrogenic effects of Rg1 were mediated through the endogenous ERs. These results suggest that ginsenoside Rg1 may attenuate 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis and its action might involve the activation of IGF-IR signaling pathway and ER signaling pathway.
