Dissecting the DNA damage response using functional genomics approaches in S. cerevisiae.

MB Davidson, GW Brown

The faithful transmission of genetic information from a mother to daughter cells can only occur if the integrity of the genome is preserved. DNA transactions within cells are tightly regulated to prevent DNA damage. When events that challenge genome integrity do occur, a complex web of DNA damage response pathways comes into play. Studies in model organisms have contributed significantly to the understanding of these pathways. In the last decade, the development of functional genomics techniques in S. cerevisiae has ushered in systematic approaches for the study of complex cellular processes. These methods have enabled the systematic interrogation of the DNA damage response.
