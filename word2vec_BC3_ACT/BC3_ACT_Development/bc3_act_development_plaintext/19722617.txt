Aromatic heterocycles as activating groups for asymmetric conjugate addition reactions. Enantioselective copper-catalyzed reduction of 2-alkenylheteroarenes.

L Rupnicki, A Saxena, HW Lam

The versatility of chiral copper hydride catalysis has been demonstrated through development of highly enantioselective 1,4-reductions of 2-alkenylheteroarenes, substrates that have been rarely considered for asymmetric conjugate addition reactions. Both azoles and azines serve as efficient activating groups for this process.
