Extramedullary plasmacytoma (EPM) is a plasma cell tumor arising outside of the bone marrow. Solitary EMP is an uncommon neoplasm and rarely occurs in the retroperitoneum and lacks distinctive clinical manifestations. We report a 26-year-old man with a solitary EMP in the retroperitoneum and discuss its clinical features, diagnosis and treatment.
