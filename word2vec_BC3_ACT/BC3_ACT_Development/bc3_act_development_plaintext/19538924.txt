PLZF outreach: a finger in interferon's pie.

K Ozato

In this issue of Immunity, Xu et al. (2009) find that the transcription factor PLZF activates interferon-stimulated genes and facilitates natural killer cell functions. Interferon-induced PLZF phosphorylation and histone deacetylase 1 recruitment probably mediates the repressor-to-activator conversion.
