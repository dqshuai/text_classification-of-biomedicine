Herein is reported a convergent synthesis of isocombretastatins A, a novel class of potent antitubulin agents. These compounds having a 1,1-diarylethylene scaffold constitute the simplest isomers of natural Z-combretastatins A that are easy to synthesize without need to control the Z-olefin geometry. The discovery of isoCA-4 with biological activities comparable to that of CA-4 represents a major progress in this field.
