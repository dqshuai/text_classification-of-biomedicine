MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA that post-transcriptionally regulates gene expression. Some miRNAs have been proposed to be associated with obesity. However, miRNAs, which are related to the development of obesity in vivo remains unknown. Here in, we found the up-regulation of miR-335 in obesity using microarray analysis for miRNA. The expressions of miR-335 in liver and white adipose tissue (WAT) were up-regulated in obese mice including ob/ob, db/db, and KKAy mice. Increased miR-335 expressions were associated with an elevated body, liver and WAT weight, and hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol. Furthermore, miR-335 levels were closely correlated with expression levels of adipocyte differentiation markers such as PPARgamma, aP2, and FAS in 3T3-L1 adipocyte. These findings provide the first evidence that the up-regulated expressions of miR-335 in liver and WAT of obese mice might contribute to the pathophysiology of obesity.
