The AT1 receptor plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. AT1 receptor expression is predominately mediated via mRNA destabilization by mRNA binding proteins. We identified via MALDI-analysis the heterogenous nuclear riboprotein S1-1 as an important regulator of AT1 receptor mRNA stability. The S1-1 protein possesses multiple nucleolar and cellular functions in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Overexpression of S1-1 sense resulted in VSMC in significant stabilization of AT1 receptor mRNA. However, this stabilization of the AT1 receptor mRNA is accompanied by a significantly reduced AT1 receptor mRNA transcription as shown via nuclear run-on assay resulting finally in reduced AT1 receptor mRNA levels. Additionally, S1-1 overexpression leads to increased apoptosis in VSMC and decreases VSMC proliferation.
