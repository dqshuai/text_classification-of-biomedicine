Cadherin adhesion receptors orient the mitotic spindle during symmetric cell division in mammalian epithelia.

Oriented cell division is a fundamental determinant of tissue organization. Simple epithelia divide symmetrically in the plane of the monolayer to preserve organ structure during epithelial morphogenesis and tissue turnover. For this to occur, mitotic spindles must be stringently oriented in the Z-axis, thereby establishing the perpendicular division plane between daughter cells. Spatial cues are thought to play important roles in spindle orientation, notably during asymmetric cell division. The molecular nature of the cortical cues that guide the spindle during symmetric cell division, however, is poorly understood. Here we show directly for the first time that cadherin adhesion receptors are required for planar spindle orientation in mammalian epithelia. Importantly, spindle orientation was disrupted without affecting tissue cohesion or epithelial polarity. This suggests that cadherin receptors can serve as cues for spindle orientation during symmetric cell division. We further show that disrupting cadherin function perturbed the cortical localization of APC, a microtubule-interacting protein that was required for planar spindle orientation. Together, these findings establish a novel morphogenetic function for cadherin adhesion receptors to guide spindle orientation during symmetric cell division.
