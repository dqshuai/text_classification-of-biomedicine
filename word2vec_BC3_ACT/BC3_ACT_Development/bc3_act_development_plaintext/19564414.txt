We have previously shown that p107, a member of the retinoblastoma (Rb) cell cycle regulatory family, has a unique function in regulating the pool of neural precursor cells. As the pool of progenitors is regulated by a limiting supply of trophic factors, we asked if the Rb/E2F pathway may control the size of the progenitor population by regulating the levels of growth factors or their receptors. Here, we demonstrate that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is aberrantly upregulated in the brains of animals lacking Rb family proteins and that the gene encoding the FGF2 ligand is directly regulated by p107 and E2F3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that E2F3 and p107 occupy E2F consensus sites on the FGF2 promoter in the context of native chromatin. To evaluate the physiological consequence of FGF2 deregulation in both p107 and E2F3 mutants, we measured neural progenitor responsiveness to growth factors. Our results demonstrate that E2F3 and p107 are each mediators of FGF2 growth factor responsiveness in neural progenitor cells. These results support a model whereby p107 regulates the pool of FGF-responsive progenitors by directly regulating FGF2 gene expression in vivo. By identifying novel roles for p107/E2F in regulating genes outside of the classical cell cycle machinery targets, we uncover a new mechanism whereby Rb/E2F mediates proliferation through regulating growth factor responsiveness.
