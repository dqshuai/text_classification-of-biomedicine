IL-24 is a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines. In this study, we investigated IL-24 expression in the inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and characterized the molecular mechanisms responsible for IL-24 expression in human colonic subepithelial myofibroblasts (SEMFs). IL-24 expression in the IBD mucosa was evaluated by immunohistochemical methods. IL-24 mRNA and protein expression was determined by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. AP-1 and C/EBP DNA-binding activity and IL-24 promoter activity were assessed by EMSA analysis and a reporter gene assay, respectively. IL-24 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in active lesions from patients who have ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Colonic SEMFs were identified as a major source of IL-24 in the mucosa. IL-1beta, but not IL-17A, TNF-alpha, or IFN-gamma, significantly enhanced IL-24 mRNA and protein expression in isolated colonic SEMFs. The IL-1beta-induced IL-24 mRNA expression was mediated by the activation of the transcription factors, AP-1 and C/EBP-beta. Induction of IL-24 mRNA stabilization was also involved in the effects of IL-1beta. IL-24 induced JAK1/STAT-3 phosphorylation and SOCS3 expression in HT-29 colonic epithelial cells. IL-24 did not modulate the proliferation of HT-29 cells, but significantly increased the mRNA expression of membrane-bound mucins (MUC1, MUC3, and MUC4). IL-24 derived from colonic SEMFs acts on colonic epithelial cells to elicit JAK1/STAT-3 activation and the expression of SOCS3 and mucins, supporting their suppressive effects on mucosal inflammation in IBD.
