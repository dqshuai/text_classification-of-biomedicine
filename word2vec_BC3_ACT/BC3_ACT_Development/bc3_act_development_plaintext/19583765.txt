Structural and mechanistic aspects of flavoproteins: photosynthetic electron transfer from photosystem I to NADP+.

M Medina

This minireview covers the research carried out in recent years into different aspects of the function of the flavoproteins involved in cyanobacterial photosynthetic electron transfer from photosystem I to NADP(+), flavodoxin and ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase. Interactions that stabilize protein-flavin complexes and tailor the midpoint potentials in these proteins, as well as many details of the binding and electron transfer to protein and ligand partners, have been revealed. In addition to their role in photosynthesis, flavodoxin and ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase are ubiquitous flavoenzymes that deliver NAD(P)H or low midpoint potential one-electron donors to redox-based metabolisms in plastids, mitochondria and bacteria. They are also the basic prototypes for a large family of diflavin electron transferases with common functional and structural properties. Understanding their mechanisms should enable greater comprehension of the many physiological roles played by flavodoxin and ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase, either free or as modules in multidomain proteins. Many aspects of their biochemistry have been extensively characterized using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, steady-state and transient kinetics, spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Despite these considerable advances, various key features of the structural-function relationship are yet to be explained in molecular terms. Better knowledge of these systems and their particular properties may allow us to envisage several interesting applications of these proteins beyond their physiological functions.
