The delta-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) enhances channel activity and alters proteolytic ENaC activation.

The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is probably a heterotrimer with three well characterized subunits (alphabetagamma). In humans an additional delta-subunit (delta-hENaC) exists but little is known about its function. Using the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system, we compared the functional properties of alphabetagamma- and deltabetagamma-hENaC and investigated whether deltabetagamma-hENaC can be proteolytically activated. The amiloride-sensitive ENaC whole-cell current (DeltaI(ami)) was about 11-fold larger in oocytes expressing deltabetagamma-hENaC than in oocytes expressing alphabetagamma-hENaC. The 2-fold larger single-channel Na(+) conductance of deltabetagamma-hENaC cannot explain this difference. Using a chemiluminescence assay, we demonstrated that an increased channel surface expression is also not the cause. Thus, overall channel activity of deltabetagamma-hENaC must be higher than that of alphabetagamma-hENaC. Experiments exploiting the properties of the known betaS520C mutant ENaC confirmed this conclusion. Moreover, chymotrypsin had a reduced stimulatory effect on deltabetagamma-hENaC whole-cell currents compared with its effect on alphabetagamma-hENaC whole-cell currents (2-fold versus 5-fold). This suggests that the cell surface pool of so-called near-silent channels that can be proteolytically activated is smaller for deltabetagamma-hENaC than for alphabetagamma-hENaC. Proteolytic activation of deltabetagamma-hENaC was associated with the appearance of a delta-hENaC cleavage product at the cell surface. Finally, we demonstrated that a short inhibitory 13-mer peptide corresponding to a region of the extracellular loop of human alpha-ENaC inhibited DeltaI(ami) in oocytes expressing alphabetagamma-hENaC but not in those expressing deltabetagamma-hENaC. We conclude that the delta-subunit of ENaC alters proteolytic channel activation and enhances base-line channel activity.
