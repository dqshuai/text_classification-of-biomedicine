Keys to open chromatin for transcription activation: FACT and Asf1.

A Krebs, L Tora

In this issue of Molecular Cell, Takahata et al. (2009) dissect the mechanisms preceding transcription initiation, revealing a wave of nucleosome eviction, which spreads from distant cis-regulatory elements to promoters and which requires the activity of histone chaperones, FACT and Asf1.
