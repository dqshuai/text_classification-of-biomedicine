TET2 mutations in myelodysplasia and myeloid malignancies.

CG Mullighan

The genetic basis of myelodysplasia has long been enigmatic, with few common targets of mutation known. A new study reports common mutations in the TET2 gene in myelodysplasia and related myeloid malignancies, suggesting that TET2 has an important role in hematopoiesis and in the pathogenesis of this disease.
