cAMP stimulates apical exocytosis of the renal Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter NKCC2 in the thick ascending limb: role of protein kinase A.

The apical renal Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter NKCC2 mediates NaCl absorption by the thick ascending limb (TAL) of Henle's loop. cAMP stimulates NKCC2 by enhancing steady-state apical membrane levels of this protein; however, the trafficking and signaling mechanisms by which this occurs have not been studied. Here, we report that stimulation of endogenous cAMP levels with either forskolin/3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) or the V2 receptor agonist [deamino-Cys(1),d-Arg(8)]vasopressin increases steady-state surface NKCC2 and that the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 blocks this effect. Confocal imaging of apical surface NKCC2 in isolated perfused TALs confirmed a stimulatory effect of cAMP on apical trafficking that was blocked by PKA inhibition. Selective stimulation of PKA with the agonist N(6)-benzoyl-cAMP (500 microm) stimulated steady-state surface NKCC2, whereas the Epac-selective agonist 8-p-chlorophenylthio-2'-O-methyl-cAMP (100 and 250 microm) had no effect. To explore the trafficking mechanism by which cAMP increases apical NKCC2, we measured cumulative apical membrane exocytosis and NKCC2 exocytic insertion in TALs. By monitoring apical FM1-43 fluorescence, we observed rapid stimulation of apical exocytosis (2 min) by forskolin/IBMX. We also found constitutive exocytic insertion of NKCC2 in TALs over time, which was increased by 3-fold in the presence of forskolin/IBMX. PKA inhibition blunted cAMP-stimulated exocytic insertion but did not affect the rate of constitutive exocytosis. We conclude that cAMP stimulates steady-state apical surface NKCC2 by stimulating exocytic insertion and that this process is highly dependent on PKA but not Epac.
