The induction of IL-10 by zymosan in dendritic cells depends on CREB activation by the coactivators CREB-binding protein and TORC2 and autocrine PGE2.

Stimulation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells with the yeast extract zymosan is characterized by a predominant production of IL-10 and a strong induction of cyclooxygenase-2, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this response are only partially understood. To address this issue, the activation of transcription factors that may bind to the il10 proximal promoter was studied. Binding activity to Sp1, Sp3, NF-Y, and cAMP response element (CRE) sites was detected in the nuclear extracts of dendritic cells; however these binding activities were not influenced by zymosan. No binding activity to Stat1, Stat3, and c/EBP sites was detected. Notably, zymosan activated kappaB-binding activity, but inhibition of NF-kappaB was associated with enhanced IL-10 production. In sharp contrast, treatments acting on CREB (CRE binding protein), including 8-Br-cAMP, PGE(2), and inhibitors of PKA, COX, and glycogen-synthase kinase-3beta showed a direct correlation between CREB activation and IL-10 production. Zymosan induced binding of both P-CREB and CREB-binding protein (CBP) to the il10 promoter as judged from chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, whereas negative results were obtained with Ab reactive to Sp1, Sp3, c-Maf, and NF-Y. Zymosan also induced nuclear translocation of the CREB coactivator transducer of regulated CREB activity 2 (TORC2) and interaction of TORC2 with P-CREB coincidental with the association of CREB to the il10 promoter. Altogether, our data show that zymosan induces il10 transcription by a CRE-dependent mechanism that involves autocrine secretion of PGE(2) and a network of interactions of PKA, MAP/ERK, glycogen-synthase kinase-3beta, and calcineurin, which regulate CREB transcriptional activity by binding the coactivators CBP and TORC2 and inhibiting CBP interaction with other transcription factors.
