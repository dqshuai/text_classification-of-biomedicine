Y-box protein (YB)-1 of the cold-shock protein family functions in gene transcription and RNA processing. Extracellular functions have not been reported, but the YB-1 staining pattern in inflammatory glomerular diseases, without adherence to cell boundaries, suggests an extracellular occurrence. Here, we show the secretion of YB-1 by mesangial and monocytic cells after inflammatory challenges. It should be noted that YB-1 was secreted through a non-classical mode resembling that of the macrophage migration inhibitory factor. YB-1 release requires ATP-binding cassette transporters, and microvesicles protect YB-1 from protease degradation. Two lysine residues in the YB-1 carboxy-terminal domain are crucial for its release, probably because of post-translational modifications. The addition of purified recombinant YB-1 protein to different cell types results in increased DNA synthesis, cell proliferation and migration. Thus, the non-classically secreted YB-1 has extracellular functions and exerts mitogenic as well as promigratory effects in inflammation.
