Shikonin, an ingredient of Lithospermum erythrorhizon, down-regulates the expression of steroid sulfatase genes in breast cancer cells.

Steroid sulfatase (STS) has an important role in regulating the biosynthesis of estrogen within breast tumors. We aimed to investigate whether shikonin, an ingredient of Lithospermum erythrorhizon, could modulate STS expression in breast cancer cells. By MTT assay, shikonin inhibited the cell proliferation of breast cancer cells MCF-7 and SK-BR-3. Moreover, by semi-quantitative/quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and dual-luciferase reporter based bioluminescent measurements, the mRNA and enzymatic activity levels of STS were decreased after shikonin treatment. Concluding, shikonin could act as a selective estrogen enzyme modulator by down-regulating the STS expression.
