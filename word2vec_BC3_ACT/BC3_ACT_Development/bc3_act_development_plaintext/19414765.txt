Age-related declines in humoral responses contribute to the reduced efficacy of vaccines in older populations. Using an adoptive transfer model, we have shown that age-related intrinsic declines in CD4 T cell function contribute significantly to the reduced humoral responses observed with aging, resulting in reduced B cell expansion and differentiation as well as reduced IgG production. In this current study, we show that the helper function of aged CD4 T cells can be enhanced using a TLR-binding adjuvant or an adjuvant containing proinflammatory (PI) cytokines. The helper function of aged CD4 T cells was also enhanced when PI cytokines were added during in vitro CD4 effector generation. Enhanced helper activity resulted in improved expansion and differentiation of B cells and affinity maturation of IgG. PI cytokines also induced significant production of effector cytokines, including IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-17, and IL-21, by both young and aged CD4 T cells. Importantly, we also show that proinflammatory adjuvants can significantly enhance the humoral response in intact aged animals. We propose that one of the mechanisms involved in the ability of adjuvants to enhance both young and aged T cell responses includes driving multifaceted T cell differentiation and production of multiple cytokines by responding CD4 T cells.
