Fe nanocrystal catalysts were synthesized by electrochemistry. Shape transformations of Fe nanocrystals from rhombic dodecahedra and tetragonal bipyramids, both bounded by {110} facets, to 18-facet polyhedra enclosed by different combinations of {110} and {100} facets and finally to cubes exclusively covered by {100} facets have been achieved. A study of the surface-structure functionality of the Fe nanocrystals toward electroreduction of nitrite revealed that the electrocatalytic activity of the Fe nanocrystals increases as the fraction of {100} facets on the surface of the Fe NCs increases.
