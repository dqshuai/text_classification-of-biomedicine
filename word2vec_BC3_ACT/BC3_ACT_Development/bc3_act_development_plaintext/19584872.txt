BACKGROUND: This multicentre, international phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety profile of a first-line combination of oral vinorelbine plus capecitabine for women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). METHODS: Patients with measurable, HER2-negative disease received, as a first line in metastatic setting, 3-weekly cycles of oral vinorelbine 80 mg m(-2) (after a first cycle at 60) on day 1 and day 8, plus capecitabine 1000 mg m(-2) (750 if >or=65 years of age) twice daily, on days 1-14. Treatment was continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were enrolled and 54 were treated (median age: 58.5 years). Most (78%) had visceral involvement and 63% had received earlier (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. The objective response rate (RECIST) in 49 evaluable patients was 51% (95% confidence interval (CI), 36-66), including complete response in 4%. The clinical benefit rate (response or stable disease for >or=6 months) was 63% (95% CI, 48-77). The median duration of response was 7.2 months (95% CI, 6.4-10.2). After a median follow-up of 41 months, median progression-free survival was 8.4 months (95% CI, 5.8-9.7) and median overall survival was 29.2 months (95% CI, 18.2-40.1). Treatment-related adverse events were manageable, the main grade 3-4 toxicity was neutropaenia (49%); two patients experienced febrile neutropaenia and three patients had a neutropaenic infection (including one septic death). A particularly low rate of alopaecia was observed. CONCLUSION: These results show that the all-oral combination of oral vinorelbine and capecitabine is an effective and well-tolerated first-line regimen for MBC.
