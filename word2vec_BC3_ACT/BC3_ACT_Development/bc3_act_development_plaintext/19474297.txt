To characterize the differences between second trimester Down syndrome (DS) and euploid fetuses, we used Affymetrix microarrays to compare gene expression in uncultured amniotic fluid supernatant samples. Functional pathway analysis highlighted the importance of oxidative stress, ion transport, and G protein signaling in the DS fetuses. Further evidence supporting these results was derived by correlating the observed gene expression patterns to those of small molecule drugs via the Connectivity Map. Our results suggest that there are secondary adverse consequences of DS evident in the second trimester, leading to testable hypotheses about possible antenatal therapy for DS.
