Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is a water channel responsible for the final water reabsorption in renal collecting ducts. Alterations in AQP2 function induce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a condition characterized by severe polyuria and polydipsia. Three patients affected with severe NDI, who were compound heterozygous for the AQP2 mutations D150E and G196D, are presented here along with a mildly affected D150E homozygous patient from another family. Using Xenopus oocytes as an expression system, these two mutations (G196D and D150E) were compared with the wild-type protein (AQP2-wt) for functional activity (water flux analysis), protein maturation, and plasma membrane targeting. AQP2-wt induces a major increase in water permeability (P(f) = 47.4 +/- 12.2 x 10(-4) cm/s) whereas D150E displays intermediate P(f) values (P(f) = 12.5 +/- 3.0 x 10(-4) cm/s) and G196D presents no specific water flux, similar to controls (P(f) = 2.1 +/- 0.8 x 10(-4) cm/s and 2.2 +/- 0.7 x 10(-4) cm/s, respectively). Western blot and immunocytochemical evaluations show protein targeting that parallels activity levels with AQP2-wt adequately targeted to the plasma membrane, partial targeting for D150E, and complete sequestration of G196D within intracellular compartments. When coinjecting AQP2-wt with mutants, no (AQP2-wt + D150E) or partial (AQP2-wt + G196D) reduction of water flux were observed compared with AQP2-wt alone, whereas complete loss of function was found when both mutants were coinjected. These results essentially recapitulate the clinical profiles of the family members, showing a typical dominant negative effect when G196D is coinjected with either AQP2-wt or D150E but not between AQP2-wt and D150E mutant.
