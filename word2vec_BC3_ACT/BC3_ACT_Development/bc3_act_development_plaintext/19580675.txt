Pathological studies on postvaccinal reactions of Rift Valley fever in goats.

SA Kamal

RVF live attenuated vaccine (Smithburn strain) was evaluated by using goats as experimental animal. The results indicate that this vaccine cause severe deleterious pathological changes in liver especially in kids and causing abortion in pregnant does. The virus was seen to be propagated inside hepatic cells forming intranuclear inclusions which was also seen by E.M. Viral antigens were detected in hepatic cells, gall bladder, endothelial lining of blood vessels, leukocytes, kidneys and heart by using immunoflourescent technique. It could be concluded that the use of live attenuated vaccine of RVF (Smithburn strain) for immunization of live stock is not safe in Egypt as it considered an endemic area.
