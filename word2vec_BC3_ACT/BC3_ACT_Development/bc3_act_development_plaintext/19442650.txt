The transcription regulator SNAI1 triggers a transcriptional program leading to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), providing epithelial cells with mesenchymal features and invasive properties during embryonic development and tumor progression. To identify early transcriptional changes occurring during SNAI1-induced EMT, we performed a time-resolved genome-scale study using human breast carcinoma cells conditionally expressing SNAI1. The approach we developed for microarray data analysis, allowed identifying three distinct EMT stages and the temporal classification of genes. Importantly, we identified unexpected, biphasic expression profiles of EMT-associated genes, supporting their pivotal role during this process. Finally, we established early EMT gene networks by identifying transcription factors and their potential targets which may orchestrate early events of EMT. Collectively, our work provides a framework for the identification and future systematic analysis of novel genes which contribute to SNAI1-triggered EMT.
