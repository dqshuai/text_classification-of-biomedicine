Nickel-catalyzed decarboxylative carboamination of alkynes with isatoic anhydrides.

Y Yoshino, T Kurahashi, S Matsubara

An intermolecular nickel-catalyzed addition reaction in which isatoic anhydrides react with alkynes to afford substituted quinolones has been developed. A mechanistic rationale is proposed, implying oxidative addition of Ni(0) to a carbamate, which allows intermolecular addition to alkynes via decarboxylation.
