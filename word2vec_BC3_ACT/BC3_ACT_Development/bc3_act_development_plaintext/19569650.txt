Five new compounds were synthesized for use as acid amplifiers in EUV (13.5 nm) photoresists. Four compounds act as acid amplifiers and decompose by autocatalytic kinetics to generate fluorinated sulfonic acids, essential for the simultaneous improvement of resolution, sensitivity, and line edge roughness (LER) in EUV photoresists. The decomposition rates were studied using (19)F NMR in the presence and absence of 1.2 equiv of tri-tert-butylpyridine. Three acid amplifiers decomposed 490, 1360, and 1430 times faster without base than with base. Preliminary lithographic evaluations show that cis-1-methyl-2-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenylsulfonyloxy)cyclohexyl acetate simultaneously improves the resolution, LER, and sensitivity of an EUV photoresist.
