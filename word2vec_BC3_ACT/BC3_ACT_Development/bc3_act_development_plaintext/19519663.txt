Retinoic acid selectively inhibits death of basal vomeronasal neurons during late stage of neural circuit formation.

In mouse, sexual, aggressive, and social behaviors are influenced by G protein-coupled vomeronasal receptor signaling in two distinct subsets of vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs): apical and basal VSNs. In addition, G protein-signaling by these receptors inhibits developmental death of VSNs. We show that cells of the vomeronasal nerve express the retinoic acid (RA) synthesizing enzyme retinal dehydrogenase 2. Analyses of transgenic mice with VSNs expressing a dominant-negative RA receptor indicate that basal VSNs differ from apical VSNs with regard to a transient wave of RA-regulated and caspase 3-mediated cell death during the first postnatal week. Analyses of G-protein subunit deficient mice indicate that RA and vomeronasal receptor signaling combine to regulate postnatal expression of Kirrel-2 (Kin of IRRE-like), a cell adhesion molecule regulating neural activity-dependent formation of precise axonal projections in the main olfactory system. Collectively, the results indicate a novel connection between pre-synaptic RA receptor signaling and neural activity-dependent events that together regulate neuronal survival and maintenance of synaptic contacts.
