Mild reduction in the activity of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex elevates GABA shunt and glycolysis.

Diminished energy metabolism and reduced activity of brain alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) occur in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. The relation between diminished KGDHC activity and altered energy metabolism is unknown. The present study tested whether a reduction in the KGDHC activity would alter cellular metabolism by comparing metabolism of [U-13C]glucose in a human embryonic kidney cell line (E2k100) to one in which the KGDHC activity was about 70% of control (E2k67). After a 2 h incubation of the cells with [U-13C]glucose, the E2k67 cells showed a greater increase in 13C labeling of alanine compared with the E2k100 cells. This suggested an increase in glycolysis. Furthermore, an increase in labeled lactate after 12 h incubation supported the suggestion of an increased glycolysis in the E2k67 cells. Increased GABA shunt in the E2k67 cells was indicated by increased 13C labeling of GABA at both 2 and 12 h compared with the control cells. GABA concentration as determined by HPLC was also increased in the E2k67 cells compared with the control cells. However, the GABA shunt was not sufficient to normalize metabolism in the E2k67 cells compared with control at 2 or 12 h. However, by 24 h metabolism had normalized (i.e. labeling was similar in E2k67 and E2k100). Thus, the data are consistent with an enhanced glycolysis and GABA shunt in response to a mild reduction in KGDHC. Our findings indicate that a mild change in KGDHC activity can lead to large changes in metabolism. The changes may maintain normal energy metabolism but make the cells more vulnerable to perturbations such as occur with oxidants.
