Lipophagy: selective catabolism designed for lipids.

H Weidberg, E Shvets, Z Elazar

Until recently, degradation of lipid droplets (LDs) has been thought to take place in the cytosol by resident lipases. In a recent issue of Nature, Singh and coworkers describe the involvement of selective autophagy in the delivery of lipid droplets for lysosomal degradation.
