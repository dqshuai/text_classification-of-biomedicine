A totally homogeneous, molecular, visible-light-driven water oxidation system is reported. The three system components are (i) a water oxidation catalyst, 1 (a Ru(IV)(4)O(4) cluster stabilized by oxidatively resistant [SiW(10)O(32)](8-) ligands); (ii) a photosensitizer, [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+); and (iii) a sacrificial electron acceptor, S(2)O(8)(2-). Dioxygen is formed rapidly with an initial turnover frequency of approximately 8 x 10(-2) s(-1) and an estimated quantum yield (defined as the number of O(2) molecules formed per two photons absorbed) of approximately 9%.
