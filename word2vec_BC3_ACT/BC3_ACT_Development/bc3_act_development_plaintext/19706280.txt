Circadian biology: a neuropeptide is bound to activate its receptor.

PH Taghert

How do circadian pacemaker neurons provide timekeeping signals by which daily rhythms are organized? Recent technological innovations in the fruitfly model system have allowed observations which suggest some important synchronizing signals may themselves not be gated.
