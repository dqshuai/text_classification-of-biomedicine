Inherited susceptibility to pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

RL Levine

Although genome-wide analyses have identified somatic alterations contributing to the pathogenesis of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), few studies have identified germline variants conferring risk of this disease. Two reports now provide the first genome-wide glimpse into the role of inherited alleles in ALL pathogenesis.
