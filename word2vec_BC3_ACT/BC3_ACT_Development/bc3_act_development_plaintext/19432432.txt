Topochemical limits for solid-state photoreactivity by fine tuning of the pi-pi interactions.

SY Yang, P Naumov, S Fukuzumi

The limiting topochemical criteria for photodimerization were studied by modulation of the pi-pi stacking interactions between self-templating planar molecules with hydrogen bonding. The product yield and composition can be controlled predominantly by the distance between the reactive bonds.
