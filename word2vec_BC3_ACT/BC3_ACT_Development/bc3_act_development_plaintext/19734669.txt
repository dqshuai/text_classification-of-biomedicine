We produced a monoclonal antibody (mAb) as a probe for detection of Tri a Bd 27K, a major wheat allergen. The mAb recognized the allergen purified from wheat flour, and the epitope on the allergen to the mAb was determined to be amino acid sequence (154)VPWVVVDGKPL(164) of Tri a Bd 27K. Of the amino acid residues on the epitope, the amino acid residues responsible for the binding to the mAb were found to be W156, D160, G161, and P163.
