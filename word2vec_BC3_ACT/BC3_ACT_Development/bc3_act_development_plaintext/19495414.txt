Prion protein expression and processing in human mononuclear cells: the impact of the codon 129 prion gene polymorphism.

C Segarra, S Lehmann, J Coste

BACKGROUND: So far, all clinical cases of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), thought to result from the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) prion agent, have shown Methionine-Methionine (M/M) homozygosity at the M129V polymorphism of the PRNP gene. Although established, this relationship is still not understood. In both vCJD and experimental BSE models prion agents do reach the bloodstream, raising concerns regarding disease transmission through blood transfusion. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the impact of the M129V polymorphism on the expression and processing of the prion protein in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from three blood donor populations with Methionine-Methionine (M/M), Valine-Valine (V/V) and M/V genotypes. Using real-time PCR, ELISA and immunoblot assays we were unable to find differences in prion protein expression and processing relating to the M129V polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that in PBMCs, the M129V PrP polymorphism has no significant impact on PrP expression, processing and the apparent glycoform distribution. Prion propagation should be investigated further in other cell types or tissues.
