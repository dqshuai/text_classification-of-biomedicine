Pharmacological suppression of leukotriene biosynthesis by inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is a strategy to intervene with inflammatory and allergic disorders. We recently presented 2-amino-5-hydroxy-1H-indoles as efficient 5-LO inhibitors in cell-based and cell-free assays. Structural optimization led to novel benzo[g]indole-3-carboxylates exemplified by ethyl 2-(3-chlorobenzyl)-5-hydroxy-1H-benzo[g]indole-3-carboxylate (compound 11a), which inhibits 5-LO activity in human neutrophils and recombinant human 5-LO with IC(50) values of 0.23 and 0.086 microM, respectively. Notably, 11a efficiently blocks 5-LO product formation in human whole blood assays (IC(50) = 0.83-1.6 microM) and significantly prevented leukotriene B(4) production in pleural exudates of carrageenan-treated rats, associated with reduced severity of pleurisy. Together, on the basis of their high potency against 5-LO and the marked efficacy in biological systems, these novel and straightforward benzo[g]indole-3-carboxylates may have potential as anti-inflammatory therapeutics.
