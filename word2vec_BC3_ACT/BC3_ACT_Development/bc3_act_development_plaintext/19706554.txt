Molecular determinants of fast Ca2+-dependent inactivation and gating of the Orai channels.

Ca(2+) influx by store-operated Ca(2+) influx channels (SOCs) mediates many cellular functions regulated by Ca(2+), and excessive SOC-mediated Ca(2+) influx is cytotoxic and associated with disease. One form of SOC is the CRAC current that is mediated by Orai channels activated by STIM1. A fundamental property of the native CRAC and of the Orais is fast Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation, which limits Ca(2+) influx to guard against cellular damage. The molecular mechanism of this essential regulatory mechanism is unknown. We report here the fast Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation is mediated by three conserved glutamates in the C termini (CT) of Orai2 and Orai3, which show prominent fast Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation compared with Orai1. Transfer of the CT between the Orais transfers both the extent of channel opening and the mode of fast Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation. Fast Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of the Orais also requires a domain of STIM1; fragments of STIM1 that efficiently open Orai channels do not evoke fast inactivation unless they include an anionic sequence that is C-terminal to the STIM1-Orai activating region (SOAR). Our studies suggest that Orai CT are necessary and sufficient to control pore opening and uncover the molecular mechanism of fast Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation that has implications for Ca(2+) influx by SOC in physiological and pathological states.
