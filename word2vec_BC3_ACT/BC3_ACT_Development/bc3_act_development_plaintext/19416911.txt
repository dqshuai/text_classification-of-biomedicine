Isoenzyme replacement of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the cytosol improves stress tolerance in plants.

In source leaves of resistant tobacco, oxidative burst and subsequent formation of hypersensitive lesions after infection with Phytophthora nicotianae was prevented by inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) or NADPH oxidases. This observation indicated that plant defense could benefit from improved NADPH availability due to increased G6PDH activity in the cytosol. A plastidic isoform of the G6PDH-encoding gene, G6PD, displaying high NADPH tolerance was engineered for cytosolic expression (cP2), and introduced into a susceptible cultivar. After infection, transgenic (previously susceptible) lines overexpressing cP2 showed early oxidative bursts, callose deposition, and changes in metabolic parameters. These responses resulted in timely formation of hypersensitive lesions similar to resistant plants, although their extent varied considerably between different transgenic lines. Additional RNAi suppression of endogenous cytosolic G6PD isoforms resulted in highly uniform defense responses and also enhanced drought tolerance and flowering. Cytosolic G6PDH seems to be a crucial factor for the outcome of plant defense responses; thus, representing an important target for modulation of stress resistance. Because isoenzyme replacement of G6PDH in the cytosol was beneficial under various kinds of cues, we propose this strategy as a tool to enhance stress tolerance in general.
