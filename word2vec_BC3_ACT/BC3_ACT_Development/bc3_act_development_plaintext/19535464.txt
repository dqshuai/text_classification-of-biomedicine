The GW182 protein family in animal cells: new insights into domains required for miRNA-mediated gene silencing.

A Eulalio, F Tritschler, E Izaurralde

GW182 family proteins interact directly with Argonaute proteins and are required for miRNA-mediated gene silencing in animal cells. The domains of the GW182 proteins have recently been studied to determine their role in silencing. These studies revealed that the middle and C-terminal regions function as an autonomous domain with a repressive function that is independent of both the interaction with Argonaute proteins and of P-body localization. Such findings reinforce the idea that GW182 proteins are key components of miRNA repressor complexes in metazoa.
