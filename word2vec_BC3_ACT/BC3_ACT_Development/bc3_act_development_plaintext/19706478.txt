The food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni is one of the leading causes of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide and the most frequent antecedent in neuropathies such as the Guillain-BarrÃ© and Miller Fisher syndromes. C. jejuni was demonstrated to possess an N-linked protein glycosylation pathway that adds a conserved heptasaccharide to >40 periplasmic and membrane proteins. Recently, we showed that C. jejuni also produces free heptasaccharides derived from the N-glycan pathway reminiscent of the free oligosaccharides (fOS) produced by eukaryotes. Herein, we demonstrate that C. jejuni fOS are produced in response to changes in the osmolarity of the environment and bacterial growth phase. We provide evidence showing the conserved WWDYG motif of the oligosaccharyltransferase, PglB, is necessary for fOS release into the periplasm. This report demonstrates that fOS from an N-glycosylation pathway in bacteria are potentially equivalent to osmoregulated periplasmic glucans in other Gram-negative organisms.
