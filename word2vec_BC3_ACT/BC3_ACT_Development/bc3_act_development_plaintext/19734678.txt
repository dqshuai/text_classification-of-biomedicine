Kinetics of the accumulation of jasmonic acid and its derivatives in systemic leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi nc) and translocation of deuterium-labeled jasmonic acid from the wounding site to the systemic site.

In plants, the mobile signal needed for wound-induced systemic acquired resistance (WSR) has been elusive. The signal compound involved in WSR is supposed to be JA or its derivatives. On the basis of kinetic study of the accumulation of JA or its derivatives, it was discovered that JA, JA-Ile, tuberonic acid (TA, 12-OH epi-JA), and tuberonic acid glucoside (TAG) accumulated in systemic tissues in response to mechanical wounding stress in the tobacco plant (Nicotiana tabacum). Attempts to recover deuterium-labeled JA in systemic leaves after feeding the wounded leaves with deuterium-labeled JA were successfully done. It was also found that the translocated deuterium-labeled JA was metabolized to TA in systemic leaves under feeding of deuterium-labeled JA to the wounding leaves.
