In this study, we examined the effects of theaflavins, polyphenols in black tea, on alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alphaMSH)-induced melanogenesis in mouse B16 melanoma cells. Among theaflavins, theaflavin-3,3'-digallate (TF-3) exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on melanogenesis. Our results indicate that the inhibitory effect of TF-3 on melanogenesis is due to suppression of tyrosinase protein and mRNA levels.
