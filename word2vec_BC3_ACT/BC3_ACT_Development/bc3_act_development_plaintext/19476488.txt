Typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins--structures, mechanisms and functions.

A Hall, PA Karplus, LB Poole

Peroxiredoxins are abundant cellular antioxidant proteins that help to control intracellular peroxide levels. These proteins may also function, in part, through an evolved sensitivity of some peroxiredoxins towards peroxide-mediated inactivation in hydrogen peroxide signaling in eukaryotes. This review summarizes recent progress in our understanding of the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of 'typical 2-Cys' peroxiredoxins and of the biological roles played by these important enzymes in oxidative stress and nonstress-related cellular signaling. New evidence suggests localized peroxide buildup plays a role in nonstress-related signaling.
