An "ice-cold" TR(i)P to skin biology: the role of TRPA1 in human epidermal keratinocytes.

T Bíró, L Kovács

Recent studies have suggested the expression of numerous heat-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels in non-neuronal cell populations of the skin. In this issue, Atoyan et al. provide evidence that the noxious cold-activated TRPA1 is widely expressed in various human cutaneous cells and that it may be directly involved in the regulation of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation and in cutaneous inflammatory responses.
