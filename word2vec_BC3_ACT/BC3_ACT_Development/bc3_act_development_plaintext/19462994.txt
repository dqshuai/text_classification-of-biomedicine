Quantum dots multifunctionalized with the amyloid protein alpha-synuclein act at nanomolar concentrations as very potent inducers of the aggregation of micromolar-millimolar bulk concentrations of the protein in vitro and in cells. Fibrillation in live cells, a process diagnostic of Parkinson's disease, is accelerated up to 15-fold with only approximately 100 nanoparticles. The combination with a tetracysteine-tagged form of alpha-synuclein specific for fluorogenic biarsenicals constitutes a very sensitive system for studying pathological amyloid formation in cells.
