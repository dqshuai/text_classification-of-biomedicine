AIM: To investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene and risk of colon cancer. METHODS: We utilized a population-based case-control study of incident colon cancer individuals (n = 421) and controls (n = 483) aged > or = 30 years to conduct a comprehensive tagSNP association analysis of the PTEN gene. RESULTS: None of the PTEN SNPs were statistically significantly associated with colon cancer when controlled for age, gender, and race, or when additionally adjusted for other known risk factors (P > 0.05). Haplotype analyses similarly showed no association between the PTEN gene and colon cancer. CONCLUSION: Our study does not support PTEN as a colon cancer susceptibility gene.
