MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1)-induced protein, a recently identified zinc finger protein, induces adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes without peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.

Adipogenesis is a key differentiation process relevant to obesity and associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes. This process involves temporally regulated genes controlled by a set of transcription factors, CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) beta, C/EBPdelta, and C/EBPalpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Currently, PPARgamma is universally accepted as the master regulator that is necessary and sufficient to induce adipogenesis as no known factor can induce adipogenesis without PPARgamma. We present evidence that a novel zinc finger protein, MCP-1-induced protein (MCPIP), can induce adipogenesis without PPARgamma. Classical adipogenesis-inducing medium induces MCP-1 production and expression of MCPIP in 3T3-L1 cells before the induction of the C/EBP family of transcription factors and PPARgamma. Knockdown of MCPIP prevents their expression and adipogenesis as measured by expression of adipocyte markers and lipid droplet accumulation. Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with MCP-1 or forced expression of MCPIP induces expression of C/EBPbeta, C/EBPdelta, C/EBPalpha, and PPARgamma and adipogenesis without any other inducer. Forced expression of MCPIP induces expression of the C/EBP family of transcription factors and adipogenesis in PPARgamma(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Thus, MCPIP is a newly identified protein that can induce adipogenesis without PPARgamma.
