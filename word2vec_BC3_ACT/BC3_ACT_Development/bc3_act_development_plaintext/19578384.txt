Conditional and reversible disruption of essential herpesvirus proteins.

M Glass, A Busche, K Wagner, M Messerle, EM Borst

Elucidating the function of essential proteins of complex pathogenic viruses is impeded by a paucity of complementing systems. By fusing a destabilizing domain of the FK506-binding protein to essential cytomegalovirus proteins, we generated virus mutants in which amounts of fusion proteins and viral growth can be regulated by the synthetic ligand shield-1. This conditional approach will greatly facilitate the analysis of gene functions of herpesviruses and viruses of other families.
