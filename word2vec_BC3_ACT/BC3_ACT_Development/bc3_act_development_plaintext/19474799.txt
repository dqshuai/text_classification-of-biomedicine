Clinical and biological studies on nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL) are hampered by the lack of specific diagnostic markers and the low reproducibility of this diagnosis. A comparative expression-profiling study has shown a set of markers to be differentially expressed in NMZL compared with follicular lymphoma (FL), including myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA), a nuclear protein expressed by myeloid cells and a subset of B-cells. The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of MNDA in normal and reactive human tissue, and in a large series of non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphomas, with particular emphasis on NMZL and FL. Our results showed that MNDA is expressed in normal tissue by a subset of the marginal zone B cells. They also showed MNDA expression in subgroups of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle-cell lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, but MNDA was especially expressed by lymphomas derived from the marginal zone, such as mucosa-associated lymphoid-tissue lymphoma, splenic marginal-zone lymphoma and NMZL. MNDA expression was rarely observed in FL, a characteristic that is of potential value in distinguishing between NMZL and FL. MNDA expression is thus a useful tool for the recognition of NMZL.
