Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a group of disorders characterized by congenital joint contractures caused by reduced fetal movements. AMC has an incidence of 1 in 3000 newborns and is genetically heterogeneous. We describe an autosomal recessive form of myogenic AMC in a large consanguineous family. The disease is characterized by bilateral clubfoot, decreased fetal movements, delay in motor milestones, then progressive motor decline after the first decade. Genome-wide linkage analysis revealed a single locus on chromosome 6q25 with Z(max) = 3.55 at theta = 0.0 and homozygosity of the polymorphic markers at this locus in patients. Homozygous A to G nucleotide substitution of the conserved AG splice acceptor site at the junction of intron 136 and exon 137 of the SYNE-1 gene was found in patients. This mutation results in an aberrant retention of intron 136 of SYNE-1 RNA leading to premature stop codons and the lack of the C-terminal transmembrane domain KASH of nesprin-1, the SYNE-1 gene product. Mice lacking the KASH domain of nesprin-1 display a myopathic phenotype similar to that observed in patients. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that the splice site mutation of SYNE-1 gene found in the family is responsible for AMC. Recent reports have shown that mutations of the SYNE-1 gene might be responsible for autosomal recessive adult onset cerebellar ataxia. These data indicate that mutations of nesprin-1 which interacts with lamin A/C may lead to at least two distinct human disease phenotypes, myopathic or neurological, a feature similar to that found in laminopathies.
