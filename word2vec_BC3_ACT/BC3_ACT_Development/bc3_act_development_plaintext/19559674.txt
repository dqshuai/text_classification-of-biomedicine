As a member of the class III histone deacetylases, Sirtuin-2 (SIRT2) is critical in cell cycle regulation which makes it a potential target for cancer therapeutics. In this study, we identified a novel SIRT2 inhibitor, AC-93253, with IC(50) of 6 microM in vitro. The compound is selective, inhibiting SIRT2 7.5- and 4-fold more potently than the closely related SIRT1 and SIRT3, respectively. AC-93253 significantly enhanced acetylation of tubulin, p53, and histone H4, confirming SIRT2 and SIRT1 as its cellular targets. AC-93253 as a single agent exhibited submicromolar selective cytotoxicity towards all four tumor cell lines tested with a therapeutic window up to 200-fold, comparing to any of the three normal cell types tested. Results from high content analysis suggested that AC-93253 significantly triggered apoptosis. Taken together, SIRT2 selective inhibitor AC-93253 may serve as a novel chemical scaffold for structure-activity relationship study and future lead development.
