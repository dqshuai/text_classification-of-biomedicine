Evidence suggests that corticotropin-releasing factor-1 (CRF(1)) receptor antagonists may offer therapeutic potential for the treatment of diseases associated with elevated levels of CRF such as anxiety and depression. A pyrazinone-based chemotype of CRF(1) receptor antagonists was discovered. Structure-activity relationship studies led to the identification of numerous potent analogues including 12p, a highly potent and selective CRF(1) receptor antagonist with an IC(50) value of 0.26 nM. The pharmacokinetic properties of 12p were assessed in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys. Compound 12p was efficacious in the defensive withdrawal test (an animal model of anxiety) in rats. The synthesis, structure-activity relationships and in vivo properties of compounds within the pyrazinone chemotype are described.
