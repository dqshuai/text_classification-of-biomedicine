The involvement of complement in the development and regulation of antibody responses under both healthy and pathological conditions is known for long. Unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying the events however is still in progress. This review focuses on the role of complement receptors CR1 (CD35) and CR2 (CD21) expressed on T and B cells. Alteration in the expression and function of these receptors may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of immune complex mediated autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Recent data regarding complement receptor expression on T lymphocytes and on memory B cells are also discussed.
