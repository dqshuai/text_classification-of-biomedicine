JJ Richards, S Reyes, SD Stowe, AT Tucker, TE Ballard, LD Mathies, J Cavanagh, C Melander

The synthesis and antibiofilm activities of sulfonamide, urea, and thiourea oroidin analogues are described. The most active derivative was able to selectively inhibit P. aeruginosa biofilm development and is also shown to be nontoxic upward of 1 mM to the development of C. elegans in comparison to other similar isosteric analogues and the natural product oroidin.
