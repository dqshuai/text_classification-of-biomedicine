We have modified the biotin switch assay for protein S-nitrosothiols (SNOs), using resin-assisted capture (SNO-RAC). Compared with existing methodologies, SNO-RAC requires fewer steps, detects high-mass S-nitrosylated proteins more efficiently, and facilitates identification and quantification of S-nitrosylated sites by mass spectrometry. When combined with iTRAQ labeling, SNO-RAC revealed that intracellular proteins may undergo rapid denitrosylation on a global scale. This methodology is readily adapted to analyzing diverse cysteine-based protein modifications, including S-acylation.
