DNA Repair (Amst.)

Perspectives on the DNA damage and replication checkpoint responses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

CD Putnam, EJ Jaehnig, RD Kolodner

The DNA damage and replication checkpoints are believed to primarily slow the progression of the cell cycle to allow DNA repair to occur. Here we summarize known aspects of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae checkpoints including how these responses are integrated into downstream effects on the cell cycle, chromatin, DNA repair, and cytoplasmic targets. Analysis of the transcriptional response demonstrates that it is far more complex and less relevant to the repair of DNA damage than the bacterial SOS response. We also address more speculative questions regarding potential roles of the checkpoint during the normal S-phase and how current evidence hints at a checkpoint activation mechanism mediated by positive feedback that amplifies initial damage signals above a minimum threshold.
