Enantioselective alpha-trifluoromethylation of aldehydes via photoredox organocatalysis.

DA Nagib, ME Scott, DW MacMillan

The first enantioselective, organocatalytic alpha-trifluoromethylation and alpha-perfluoroalkylation of aldehydes have been accomplished using a readily available iridium photocatalyst and a chiral imidazolidinone catalyst. A range of alpha-trifluoromethyl and alpha-perfluoroalkyl aldehydes were obtained from commercially available perfluoroalkyl halides with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. The resulting alpha-trifluoromethyl aldehydes were subsequently shown to be versatile precursors for the construction of a variety of enantioenriched trifluoromethylated building blocks.
