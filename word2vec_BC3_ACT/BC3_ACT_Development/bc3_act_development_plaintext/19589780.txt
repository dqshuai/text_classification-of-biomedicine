Epstein-Barr virus, a ubiquitous human herpesvirus, is associated with the development of carcinomas and lymphomas. We previously showed that transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) mediated the virus to enter the lytic cycle, which is triggered by expression of Z Epstein-Barr virus replication activator (ZEBRA), through the ERK 1/2 MAPK signaling pathway. We report here that Akt, activated downstream from ERK 1/2, was required for TGF-beta1-induced ZEBRA expression and enabled Smad3, a mediator of TGF-beta1 signaling, to be acetylated by direct interaction with the co-activator CREB-binding protein and then to regulate TGF-beta1-induced ZEBRA expression.
