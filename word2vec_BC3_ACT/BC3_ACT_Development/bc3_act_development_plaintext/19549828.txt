Molecular recognition and self-assembly special feature: Assembly and organization processes in DNA-directed colloidal crystallization.

We present an analysis of the key steps involved in the DNA-directed assembly of nanoparticles into crystallites and polycrystalline aggregates. Additionally, the rate of crystal growth as a function of increased DNA linker length, solution temperature, and self-complementary versus non-self-complementary DNA linker strands (1- versus 2-component systems) has been studied. The data show that the crystals grow via a 3-step process: an initial "random binding" phase resulting in disordered DNA-AuNP aggregates, followed by localized reorganization and subsequent growth of crystalline domain size, where the resulting crystals are well-ordered at all subsequent stages of growth.
