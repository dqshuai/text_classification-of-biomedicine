Cloning and characterization of flagellin genes and identification of flagellin glycosylation from thermophilic Bacillus species.

J Hayakawa, Y Kondoh, M Ishizuka

Flagellin glycosylation was identified in Bacillus sp. PS3 and Geobacillus stearothermophilus. In vivo complementation showed that these flagellin genes did not restore the motility of a Bacillus subtilis flagellin mutant, whereas the genes encoding non-glycosylated flagellin from Geobacillus kaustophilus and Bacillus sp. Kps3 restored motility. Moreover, four types of flagellins expressed in B. subtilis were not glycosylated. We speculate that glycosylation is required for flagellar filament assembly of these bacilli.
