BACKGROUND: The heart produces apolipoprotein-B containing lipoproteins (apoB) whose function is not well understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate importance of myocardial apoB for cardiac function, structure and survival in myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF). METHODS AND RESULTS: MI was induced in mice (n=137) and myocardial apoB content was measured at 30 min, 3, 6, 24, 48, 120 h and 8 weeks post-MI. Transgenic mice overexpressing apoB (n=27) and genetically matched controls (n=27) were used to study the effects of myocardial apoB on cardiac function, remodeling, arrhythmias and survival after MI. Echocardiography was performed at rest and stress conditions at baseline, 2, 4 and 6 week post-MI and cumulative survival rate was registered. The myocardial apoB content increased both in the injured and the remote myocardium (p<0.05) in response to ischemic injury. ApoB mice had 2-fold higher survival rate (p<0.05) and better systolic function (p<0.05) post-MI. CONCLUSION: Overexpression of apoB in the heart increases survival and improves cardiac function after acute MI. Myocardial apoB may be an important cardioprotective system in settings such as myocardial ischemia and HF.
