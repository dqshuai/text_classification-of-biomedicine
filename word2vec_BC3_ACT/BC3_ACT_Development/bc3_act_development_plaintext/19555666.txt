19S regulatory particles (19SRP) of 26S proteasome participate in multiple steps of gene transcription in yeast. We previously showed that Tat-binding protein-1 (TBP-1), an ATPase of 19SRP, interacts with thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and enhances TR-mediated transcription synergistically with steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1). To further elucidate the roles of ATPases and a non-ATPase component of 19SRP in gene regulation by TR, we investigated whether knockdown (KO) of TBP-1, TRIP1 or Rpn10 using small interfering RNA affects TR-mediated transactivation in HeLa cells. KO of individual subunits attenuated TR-mediated transactivation through the thyroid hormone response element (TRE) in the absence or presence of cotransfected SRC-1 without altering TR and SRC-1 protein levels. KO of TBP-1 disrupted ligand-induced loading of TR, SRC-1, and RNA polymerase II in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Collectively, both ATPase and non-ATPase components of 19SRP play critical roles in TR-mediated transactivation by coordinating the proper loading of liganded TR to TRE.
