The complete genomes of 30 Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) isolates and strains were sequenced in this study. Together with fourteen previously reported sequences, we analyzed the genetic structure of the SMV population. Analyses of genetic diversity showed that different genomic regions of SMV are under different evolutionary constraints and that there was no significant genetic differentiation between East Asian and North American populations of SMV. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a significant correlation between phylogeny of the cylindrical inclusion (CI) gene of SMV and SMV resistance gene 3 (Rsv3)-relating pathogenicity of SMV, suggesting CI might be a pathogenic determinant in Rsv3-mediated disease response. Interestingly, recombination analyses identified 19 'clear' recombination events in the SMV population. Furthermore, as several resistance-breaking strains were identified as recombinants, it appears that recombination might contribute to overcome host resistance in SMV-soybean pathosystem. Our finding suggests that recombination as well as mutation is an important evolutionary process in the genetic diversification of SMV population.
