Flower morphogenesis: timing is key.

D Wagner

Flowers are unique parts of plants because they form a predictable number of organs of defined identity. This exquisite regularity defines entire plant families and has been used for taxonomic classification since ancient times. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Liu et al. reveal that timing of the onset of flower differentiation is key for the stereotypic architecture of flowers.
