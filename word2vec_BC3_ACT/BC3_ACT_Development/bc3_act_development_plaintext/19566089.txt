Folding DNA origami from a double-stranded source of scaffold.

B HÃ¶gberg, T Liedl, WM Shih

Combined heat and chemical denaturation of double-stranded DNA scaffold strands in the presence of staple strands, followed by a sudden temperature drop and then stepwise dialysis to remove the chemical denaturant, leads to self-assembly of two distinct DNA-origami structures.
