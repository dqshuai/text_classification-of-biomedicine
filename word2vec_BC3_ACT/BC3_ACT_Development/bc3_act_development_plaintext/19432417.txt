Phthalimide-based polymers for high performance organic thin-film transistors.

X Guo, FS Kim, SA Jenekhe, MD Watson

The synthesis and characterization of two new thiophene copolymers with backbone phthalimide units is reported. Thin-film optical and wide-angle X-ray diffraction measurements indicate extended electronic conjugation and close intermolecular pi-stacking for both polymers. Ambient carrier mobility of thin-film transistors prepared from these polymers is as high as 0.28 cm(2)/(V s) with an on/off ratio greater than 10(5).
