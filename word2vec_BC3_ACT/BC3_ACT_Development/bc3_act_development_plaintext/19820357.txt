Aluminum induced proteome changes in tomato cotyledons.

S Zhou, R Sauve, TW Thannhauser

Cotyledons of tomato seedlings that germinated in a 20 microM AlK(SO(4))(2) solution remained chlorotic while those germinated in an aluminum free medium were normal (green) in color. Previously, we have reported the effect of aluminum toxicity on root proteome in tomato seedlings (Zhou et al.(1)). Two dimensional DIGE protein analysis demonstrated that Al stress affected three major processes in the chlorotic cotyledons: antioxidant and detoxification metabolism (induced), glyoxylate and glycolytic processes (enhanced), and the photosynthetic and carbon fixation machinery (suppressed).
