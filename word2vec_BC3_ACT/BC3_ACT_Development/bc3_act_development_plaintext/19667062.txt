Stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) by pathogen-derived products induces the production of cytokines, which play an important role in immune responses. Here, we investigated the role of the TPL-2 signaling pathway in TLR induction of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in these cell types. It has previously been suggested that IFN-beta and IL-10 are coordinately regulated after TLR stimulation. However, in the absence of TPL-2 signaling, lipopolysaccharide (TLR4) and CpG (TLR9) stimulation resulted in increased production of IFN-beta while decreasing IL-10 production by both macrophages and myeloid DCs. In contrast, CpG induction of both IFN-alpha and IFN-beta by plasmacytoid DCs was decreased in the absence of TPL-2, although extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation was blocked. Extracellular signal-related kinase-dependent negative regulation of IFN-beta in macrophages was IL-10-independent, required protein synthesis, and was recapitulated in TPL-2-deficient myeloid DCs by retroviral transduction of the ERK-dependent transcription factor c-fos.
