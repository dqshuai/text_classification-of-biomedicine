Recently, there has been increasing evidence that a non-synonymous exchange (Gly307Ser) in the gene for CD226 is linked to several autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis and Grave's disease. Here we present evidence that this polymorphism also predisposes to Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), an autoimmune condition belonging to the group of ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody)-associated vasculitides. We found a significant association of the 307Ser allele in separate panels of 520 Northern German (P=0.016, odds ratio (OR)=1.20) and 122 Southern German (P=0.020, OR=1.37) WG cases compared with 1226 healthy controls. The importance of this single-nucleotide polymorphism in the etiopathology of ANCA-associated vasculitides is supported by similar effect sizes that we found in British WG cases (n=105) and German patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome (n=119), which, however, miss significance level because of the relatively small cohorts available for these rare disorders. Finally, we confirm the association with MS in a cohort of 422 German patients (P=0.011, OR=1.23).
