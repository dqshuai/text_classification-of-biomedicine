The syntheses of all stereoisomers of tetrasubstituted tetrahydrofuran lignan were accomplished, and the antimicrobial activity was examined. The 9,9'-diol compound bearing (7R,7'R,8R,8'R) and (7R,7'S,8R,8'R) stereochemistry showed the strongest antibacterial activity against Listeria denitrificans and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. It was also found that (-)-virgatusin bearing (7S,7'R,8S,8'S) stereochemistry had strongest antifungal activity.
