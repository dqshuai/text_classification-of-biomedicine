Propionibacterium acnes and sebaceous lipogenesis: a love-hate relationship?

CC Zouboulis

In this issue, Iinuma et al. show that Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes)-conditioned medium and formalin-killed P. acnes augment intracellular lipid formation in hamster sebocytes by increasing the de novo synthesis of triacylglycerols. This commentary summarizes the current knowledge of the association of P. acnes with sebaceous lipogenesis, inflammation, and innate immunity, and points out the concurrent evidence that P. acnes-induced lipids may represent a recruitment of allies and/or enemies of the human skin.
