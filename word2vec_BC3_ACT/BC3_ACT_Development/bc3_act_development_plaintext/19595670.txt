Here we analyzed Pfkfb3 and Pfkfb4 gene expression in rat testis development, isolated testicular cells and spermatozoa. Real time RT-PCR analysis during testis development showed the maximum expression of Pfkfb3 in pre-puber samples and of Pfkfb4 in adult samples. Western blot analysis showed that uPFK-2 protein, a product of Pfkfb3 gene, was present in all the cell types forming the seminiferous epithelium (Sertoli, interstitial and spermatogenic cells). In contrast, tPFK-2, a product of Pfkfb4 gene, was restricted to spermatogenic cells. Confocal analyses by indirect immunofluorescence also corroborated this expression pattern. Immunoblotting studies of isolated spermatozoa demonstrated the presence of uPFK-2 only in immature sperm and once spermatozoa became fully functional this isozyme was replaced by the testicular isozyme tPFK-2. Moreover, immunostaining confirmed that tPFK-2 was localized mainly in the acrosomal region of the sperm head and in the mid-piece of the flagellum, where other spermatogenic cell-specific glycolytic enzymes have been found.
