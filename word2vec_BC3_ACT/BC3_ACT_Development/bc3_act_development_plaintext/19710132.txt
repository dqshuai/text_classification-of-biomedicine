Dynamin- and lipid raft-dependent entry of decay-accelerating factor (DAF)-binding and non-DAF-binding coxsackieviruses into nonpolarized cells.

Group B coxsackieviruses (CVB) use the CVB and adenovirus receptor (CAR) to enter and infect cells. Some CVB also bind to decay-accelerating factor (DAF), but that interaction alone is insufficient for infection. We previously found that CVB3 entry into polarized human intestinal cells (Caco-2) occurs by a caveolin-dependent but dynamin-independent mechanism that requires DAF-mediated tyrosine kinase signals. In this study, we examined how CVB enter and infect nonpolarized HeLa cells and how DAF binding affects these processes. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and a combination of dominant-negative proteins, small interfering RNAs, and drugs targeting specific endocytic pathways, we found that both DAF-binding and non-DAF-binding virus isolates require dynamin and lipid rafts to enter and infect cells. Unlike what we observed in Caco-2 cells, CVB3 entered HeLa cells with CAR. We found no role for clathrin, endosomal acidification, or caveolin. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases blocked an early event in infection but did not prevent entry of virus into the cell. These results indicate that CVB3 entry into nonpolarized HeLa cells differs significantly from entry into polarized Caco-2 cells and is not influenced by virus binding to DAF.
