1,5-anhydro-d-fructose (1,5-AF), a monosaccharide formed from starch and glycogen, exhibits antioxidant and antibacterial activity, and inhibits cytokine release by attenuating NF-kappaB activation in LPS-stimulated mice. The present study examined whether 1,5-AF inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in vitro and in vivo. We found that 1,5-AF significantly blocked the production of NO, and protein and mRNA expression of iNOS, and up-regulated IL-10 production in vitro. We also investigated the effects of 1,5-AF on acute lung inflammation in C57BL/6J mice. We found that protein and mRNA expression of iNOS in lung tissues were inhibited by 1,5-AF pretreatment. In addition, the serum level of IL-10 was upregulated by 1,5-AF. Collectively, the iNOS transcriptional and translational inhibitory effects of 1,5-AF seem to be prolonged and enhanced by the production of IL-10. These results suggest that 1,5-AF could be a useful adjunct in the treatment of acute lung inflammation.
