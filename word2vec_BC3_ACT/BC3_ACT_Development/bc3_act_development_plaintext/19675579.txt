Regeneration of multilineage skin epithelia by differentiated keratinocytes.

Although homeostasis of rapidly renewing tissues like skin epithelia is maintained by stem cells, the committed progeny of stem cells in the basal layer of epidermis retain regenerative potential and are capable of forming epidermis in response to environmental cues. It is not clear, however, at what point within the epidermal lineage keratinocytes lose this regenerative potential. In this study, we examined the extent of tissue formation by post-mitotic differentiated keratinocytes. We show that cultures of mouse keratinocytes that were, by all measures, differentiated were able to reform a self-renewing, hair-bearing skin when transplanted onto suitable sites in vivo. Genetic labeling and lineage-tracing studies in combination with an involucrin-driven Cre/lox reporter system confirmed that transplanted differentiated keratinocytes were indeed the source of the regenerated skin. More importantly, analysis of early stages of skin regeneration showed hallmarks of dedifferentiation of transplanted differentiated keratinocytes. These data indicate that commitment to differentiation does not prohibit cells from re-entering the cell cycle, de-differentiating, and acquiring "stemness". These findings suggest that epidermis can use different strategies for homeostasis and tissue regeneration.
