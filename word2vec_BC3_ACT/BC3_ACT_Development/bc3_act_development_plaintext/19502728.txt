Pine bark extract (PBE) mainly contains proanthocyanidin in oligomers. It has many physiological effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and so on. In this study, we investigated whether PBE has an anti-atherogenic effect on apoE-deficient mice. Male and female mice were fed a diet based on an AIN-76 formula (control diet), and that diet supplemented with 2% PBE (the PBF diet). The PBE diet, compared with the control diet, resulted in lowering the body weight gain and the adipose tissue weight in both male and female mice. The lesion area of the valve and the levels of serum and liver cholesterol in the male mice decreased on the PBE diet. The PBE diet had no significant effect on the levels of urinary isoprostanes or serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. These results indicate that dietary PBE can have beneficial effects on atherosclerosis development in male apoE-deficient mice by lowering the serum cholesterol level.
