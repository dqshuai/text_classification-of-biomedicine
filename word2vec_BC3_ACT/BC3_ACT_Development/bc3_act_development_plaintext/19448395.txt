Cell Cycle

Aging-suppressants: cellular senescence (hyperactivation) and its pharmacologic deceleration.

MV Blagosklonny

Here I overview the accompanying three reports on suppression of cellular senescence with inhibitors of mTOR, PI-3K and MEK. How can growth inhibitors suppress senescence? May these aging-suppressants decelerate organismal aging? To answer these questions, we need to reconsider the meaning of aging.
