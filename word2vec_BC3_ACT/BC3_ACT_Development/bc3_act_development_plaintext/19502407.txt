Structural basis for the localization of the chemotaxis phosphatase CheZ by CheAS.

S Hao, D Hamel, H Zhou, FW Dahlquist

CheA-short interacts with CheZ to localize CheZ to cell poles. The fifth helical region (residues 112 to 133) from the phosphotransfer domain of CheA interacts with CheZ and becomes ordered and helical, although it lacks a stable fold in the CheA fragment comprising residues 98 to 150 alone. One CheA molecule binds to one CheZ dimer.
