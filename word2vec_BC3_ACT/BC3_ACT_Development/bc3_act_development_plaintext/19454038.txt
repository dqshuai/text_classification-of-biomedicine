BACKGROUND: This retrospective study evaluated, according to hormone receptor status, the antitumor effects of bisphosphonate especially on survival and disease progression in breast cancer patients with metastatic bone disease. METHODS: Of 317 patients with initial bone metastasis and known breast cancer subtypes, 230 patients (72.6%) had hormone receptor (HR) positive tumors, and 87 patients (27.4%) had HR negative tumors. We assessed the primary outcome of overall survival (OS), after adjusting for other factors, comparing a group that received bisphosphonates (BPs) with a group that did not receive it. RESULTS: 87.8% of HR positive and 69.0% of HR negative patients received BPs with a median number of 17.7 cycles. Although BPs treatment made no survival benefit in HR positive group, HR negative patients showed a significant prolonged survival when they received BPs treatment (hazard ratio = 0.56 [95% CI 0.34 to 0.91], P = 0.019). In multivariate analysis, disease free interval > 2 years (P = 0.036), a sum of metastatic sites < 3 (P = 0.034), and BP treatments (P = 0.007) were significant factors for survival in HR negative patients. CONCLUSION: Bisphosphonate treatment can result in a survival benefit in metastatic breast cancer patients with HR negative tumors.
