Mechanistic considerations of halogenating enzymes.

A Butler, M Sandy

In nature, halogenation is a strategy used to increase the biological activity of secondary metabolites, compounds that are often effective as drugs. However, halides are not particularly reactive unless they are activated, typically by oxidation. The pace of discovery of new enzymes for halogenation is increasing, revealing new metalloenzymes, flavoenzymes, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent enzymes and others that catalyse halide oxidation using dioxygen, hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxides, or that promote nucleophilic halide addition reactions.
