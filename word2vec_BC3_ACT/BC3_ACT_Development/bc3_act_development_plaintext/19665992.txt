Cell attachment is provided by cell-matrix and cell-cell bonds, and acts as a regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) survival, activity and homeostasis, as well as of VSMCs response to pathogenic stimuli. In this work we elicited an exclusive cell-cell contact by culturing A7r5 VSMCs on agarose-coated wells to form floating cell clusters, and we demonstrated that a steady state with a reduced response to the vasoactive peptide Angiotensin II (ATII) was induced. We found that clustered VSMCs showed subcortical stabilization of beta-catenin and Caveolin 1 (Cav1), unlike adherent confluent counterparts. We demonstrated that beta-catenin and Cav1 stabilization at the membrane level hampers the molecular cross-talk induced by ATII-activated AT1 receptor (AT1R), thereby impeding the phosphorylation of Cav1 and IGF1R, the NADPH oxidase activity, and counteracting ATII-dependent hypertrophy. Thus, elective cell-cell bond might modulate the proatherogenic activity of ATII, reducing the adverse vascular remodelling associated with AT1R activation.
