Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition modulates dendritic cell (DC) functions and regulates experimental graft-vs-host disease and other immune-mediated diseases. The mechanisms by which HDAC inhibition modulates immune responses remain largely unknown. STAT-3 is a transcription factor shown to negatively regulate DC functions. In this study we report that HDAC inhibition acetylates and activates STAT-3, which regulates DCs by promoting the transcription of IDO. These findings demonstrate a novel functional role for posttranslational modification of STAT-3 through acetylation and provide mechanistic insights into HDAC inhibition-mediated immunoregulation by induction of IDO.
