AtCYP20-2 is an auxiliary protein of the chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex.

AtCYP20-2 is one of 16 immunophilins in thylakoid lumen. The presence of the isomerase domain in AtCYP20-2, an enrichment of AtCYP20-2 in the stroma membranes and it's co-migration with NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) in native gels provide evidence that AtCYP20-2 is an auxiliary protein of NDH. When different NDH mutants were studied, AtCYP20-2 was found to be strongly reduced especially in mutants deficient in the membrane domain of NDH, thus suggesting a role in the assembly of NDH hydrophobic domain. Lack of AtCYP20-2, however, did not lead to severe malfunction of NDH, indicating redundancy in the function of lumenal immunophilins.
