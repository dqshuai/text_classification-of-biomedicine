Maintaining immune homeostasis in fly gut.

F Leulier, J Royet

Like every metazoan species hosting a gut flora, drosophila tolerate commensal microbiota yet remain able to mount an efficient immune response to food-borne pathogens. New findings explain how the quantity of reactive oxygen species in the gut is 'tuned' to microbial burden and how intestinal immune homeostasis is thereby maintained
