Impact of quaternary organization on the antigenic structure of the tick-borne encephalitis virus envelope glycoprotein E.

S Kiermayr, K Stiasny, FX Heinz

The envelope protein E of flaviviruses mediates both receptor-binding and membrane fusion. At the virion surface, 180 copies of E are tightly packed and organized in a herringbone-like icosahedral structure, whereas in noninfectious subviral particles, 60 copies are arranged in a T=1 icosahedral symmetry. In both cases, the basic building block is an E dimer which exposes the binding sites for neutralizing antibodies at its surface. It was the objective of our study to assess the dependence of the antigenic structure of E on its quaternary arrangement, i.e., as part of virions, recombinant subviral particles, or soluble dimers. For this purpose, we used a panel of 11 E protein-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, mapped to distinct epitopes in each of the three E protein domains, and studied their reactivity with the different soluble and particulate forms of tick-borne encephalitis virus E protein under nondenaturing immunoassay conditions. Significant differences in the reactivities with these forms were observed that could be related to (i) limited access of certain epitopes at the virion surface; (ii) limited occupancy of epitopes in virions due to steric hindrance between antibodies; (iii) differences in the avidity to soluble forms compared to the virion, presumably related to the flexibility of E at its domain junctions; and (iv) modulations of the external E protein surface through interactions with its stem-anchor structure. We have thus identified several important factors that influence the antigenicity of the flavivirus E protein and have an impact on the interaction with neutralizing antibodies.
