Neurobiology: reconstructing the neural control of leg coordination.

SN Zill, BR Keller

Walking is adaptable because the timing of movements of individual legs can be varied while maintaining leg coordination. Recent work in stick insects shows that leg coordination set by interactions of pattern generating circuits can be overridden by sensory feedback.
