Studies have suggested involvement of interleukin 17 (IL-17) in autoimmune diseases, although its effect on B cell biology has not been clearly established. Here we demonstrate that IL-17 alone or in combination with B cell-activating factor controlled the survival and proliferation of human B cells and their differentiation into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. This effect was mediated mainly through the nuclear factor-kappaB-regulated transcription factor Twist-1. In support of the relevance of our observations and the potential involvement of IL-17 in B cell biology, we found that the serum of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus had higher concentrations of IL-17 than did the serum of healthy people and that IL-17 abundance correlated with the disease severity of systemic lupus erythematosus.
