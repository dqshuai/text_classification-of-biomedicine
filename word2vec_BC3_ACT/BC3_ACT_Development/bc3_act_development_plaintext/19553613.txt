PURPOSE: The pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy is mediated by leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium of the diabetic retina, which results in endothelial injury, blood-retina barrier breakdown, and capillary nonperfusion. Leukocyte adhesion is triggered by the interaction of vascular endothelium adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1, with leukocyte integrins, such as CD18. Inhibition of ICAM-1/CD18 signaling suppresses but does not completely abolish the cardinal manifestations of diabetic retinopathy, suggesting a role for additional adhesion molecules. Integrin alpha 4 (CD49d), in complex with integrin beta1, forms very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), which interacts with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. The authors have now studied the role of integrin alpha 4/CD49d in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: Diabetes mellitus was induced in Long Evans rats with streptozotocin, and an anti-alpha 4 integrin/CD49d neutralizing antibody was injected 5 and 10 days later. Two weeks after streptozotocin administration, vascular leakage was quantified with the Evans Blue technique. Leukostasis was measured with a static adhesion assay ex vivo and the FITC-lectin perfusion method in vivo. Retinal VEGF and TNF-alpha levels and NF-kappaB activity were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Blockade of alpha 4 integrin/CD49d attenuated the diabetes-induced upregulation of NF-kappaB activation, VEGF, and TNF-alpha protein levels and reduced significantly diabetes-induced leukocyte adhesion and vascular leakage. CONCLUSIONS: These data identify alpha 4 integrin/CD49d as a mediator of leukocyte adhesion and the resultant early signature abnormalities of diabetic retinopathy. Inhibition of this signaling pathway may hold promise for clinical activity in patients with diabetes.
