Polymerization reactions of phenylacetylene derivatives are promoted by rhodium complexes within the discrete space of apo-ferritin in aqueous media. The catalytic reaction provides polymers with restricted molecular weight and a narrow molecular weight distribution. These results suggest that protein nanocages have potential for use as various reaction spaces through immobilization of metal catalysts on the interior surfaces of the protein cages.
