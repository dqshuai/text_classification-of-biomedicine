Intracellular transport: how do motors work together?

R Mallik, SP Gross

How many motors move cargos on microtubules inside a cell, and how do they work together to achieve regulated transport? A new study uses an optical trap to investigate the motion of protein-bound beads on the surface of flagella to address these questions and comes up with some intriguing answers.
