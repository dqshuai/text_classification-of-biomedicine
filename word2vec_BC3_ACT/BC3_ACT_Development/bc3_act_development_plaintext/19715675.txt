Dihydroxyacetone (DHA) induces the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), which are involved in several diseases. Earlier, we identified dihydroxyacetone kinase 1 (Dak1) as a candidate glutathione peroxidase 3 (Gpx3)-interacting protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This finding is noteworthy, as no clear evidence on the involvement of oxidative stress systems in DHA-induced AGE formation has been found to date. Here, we demonstrate that Gpx3 interacts with Dak1, alleviates DHA-mediated stress by upregulating Dak activity, and consequently suppresses AGE formation. Based on these results, we propose that defense systems against oxidative stress and DHA-induced AGE formation are related via interactions between Gpx3 and Dak1.
