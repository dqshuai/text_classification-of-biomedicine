A critical process controlled by MalT and OmpR is revealed through synthetic lethality.

SA Reimann, AJ Wolfe

The death of cells harboring defects in two distinct pathways implicates these pathways in the control of an essential process. Here we report that cells lacking OmpR and harboring constitutively active MalT undergo premature death that involves increased expression of the outer membrane porin LamB.
