The NIMA-related kinase NEK1 cycles through the nucleus.

LK Hilton, MC White, LM Quarmby

Mutations in NEK1 in mice are causal for cystic kidneys, and model the ciliopathy polycystic kidney disease caused by abnormal ciliary structure or signaling. NEK1 has previously been shown to localize near centrosomes and to play a role in centrosomal stability and ciliogenesis. Recent data suggest that the etiology of kidney cysts involves aberrant signaling from the primary cilium to the nucleus. Here we demonstrate that NEK1 contains functional nuclear localization signals, is exported from the nucleus via a nuclear export signal-dependent pathway and that the protein cycles through the nucleus. Our data suggest that NEK1 is a candidate to transduce messages from the ciliary-basal body region to the regulation of nuclear gene expression.
