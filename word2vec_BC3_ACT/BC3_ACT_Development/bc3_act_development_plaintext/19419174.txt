A double charge density wave in the single tellurium square net in Cu0.63EuTe2?

CD Malliakas, MG Kanatzidis

A double-superimposed charge density wave (CDW) distortion with modulation vectors oriented in the same direction observed in the square net of Cu(0.63)EuTe(2) represents the first example of its kind among CDW materials with electronic Fermi surface instabilities.
