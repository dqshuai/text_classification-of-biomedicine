Analysis of insoluble proteins.

S Trimpin, B Brizzard

The analysis of insoluble proteins represents a major technical challenge for the field of proteomics. For example, membrane proteins are often insoluble in common solvents and represent 20-30% of the proteins encoded by the human genome. Chemical analysis on an individual basis is often required and is laborious and time-consuming. This review presents an overview of methods for purification of expressed proteins using fusion tags as well as methods for analysis of insoluble proteins by mass spectrometry with a goal of achieving high-throughput analysis.
