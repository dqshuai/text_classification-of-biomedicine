Molecular model of a cell plasma membrane with an asymmetric multicomponent composition: water permeation and ion effects.

R VÃ¡cha, ML Berkowitz, P Jungwirth

We present molecular dynamics simulations of a multicomponent, asymmetric bilayer in mixed aqueous solutions of sodium and potassium chloride. Because of the geometry of the system, there are two aqueous solution regions in our simulations: one mimics the intracellular region, and one mimics the extracellular region. Ion-specific effects are evident at the membrane/aqueous solution interface. Namely, at equal concentrations of sodium and potassium, sodium ions are more strongly adsorbed to carbonyl groups of the lipid headgroups. A significant concentration excess of potassium is needed for this ion to overwhelm the sodium abundance at the membrane. Ion-membrane interactions also lead to concentration-dependent and cation-specific behavior of the electrostatic potential in the intracellular region because of the negative charge on the inner leaflet. In addition, water permeation across the membrane was observed on a timescale of approximately 100 ns. This study represents a step toward the modeling of realistic biological membranes at physiological conditions in intracellular and extracellular environments.
