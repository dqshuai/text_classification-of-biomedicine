Structure

Invasive DNA, chopped and in the CRISPR.

LA Marraffini, EJ Sontheimer

In this issue of Structure, Wiedenheft et al. describe the structure and activity of Cas1, the only protein associated with all CRISPR loci. Cas1 is a metal-dependent deoxyribonuclease, consistent with a role in the adaptation phase of CRISPR immunity against invading nucleic acids.
