Very few of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in Streptomyces have been identified. Here, we identify a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), designated as SCO5717. The protein possesses Walker motifs and a tyrosine cluster at the C-terminus. When sco5717 harboring its own promoter was introduced into the S. coelicolor cell, the growth was inhibited. An sco5717-disrupted mutant formed aerial mycelium earlier than the wild-type strain, suggesting that SCO5717 controls the cell growth of S. coelicolor. Although the recombinant SCO5717 showed an ATPase activity, it lacked self-phosphorylation ability, suggesting that SCO5717 is a novel tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, which is distinguishable from bacterial protein tyrosine kinases known so far.
