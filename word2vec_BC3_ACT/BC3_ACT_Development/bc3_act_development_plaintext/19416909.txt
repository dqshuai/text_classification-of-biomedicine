Constitutional self-instructed membranes were developed and used for mimicking the adaptive structural functionality of natural ion-channel systems. These membranes are based on dynamic hybrid materials in which the functional self-organized macrocycles are reversibly connected with the inorganic silica through hydrophobic noncovalent interactions. Supramolecular columnar ion-channel architectures can be generated by reversible confinement within scaffolding hydrophobic silica mesopores. They can be structurally determined by using X-ray diffraction and morphologically tuned by alkali-salts templating. From the conceptual point of view, these membranes express a synergistic adaptive behavior: the simultaneous binding of the fittest cation and its anion would be a case of "homotropic allosteric interactions," because in time it increases the transport efficiency of the pore-contained superstructures by a selective evolving process toward the fittest ion channel. The hybrid membranes presented here represent dynamic constitutional systems evolving over time to form the fittest ion channels from a library of molecular and supramolecular components, or selecting the fittest ion pairs from a mixture of salts demonstrating flexible adaptation.
