Stereoelectronic effect for the selectivity in C-H insertion of alkylidene carbenes and its application to the synthesis of platensimycin.

SY Yun, JC Zheng, D Lee

A systematic study of C-H insertion reactions with variously substituted and conformationally constrained substrates was carried out. High selectivity in the insertion between two competing C-H bonds caused by a strong stereoelectronic effect of an oxygen substituent was achieved. This regioselective C-H insertion reaction was employed as a platform to develop a concise asymmetric synthesis of platensimycin.
