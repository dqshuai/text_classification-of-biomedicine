Cytoplasmic inclusion cistron of Soybean mosaic virus serves as a virulence determinant on Rsv3-genotype soybean and a symptom determinant.

Soybean mosaic virus (SMV; Potyvirus, Potyviridae) is one of the most widespread viruses of soybean globally. Three dominant resistance genes (Rsv1, Rsv3 and Rsv4) differentially confer resistance against SMV. Rsv1 confers extreme resistance and the resistance mechanism of Rsv4 is associated with late susceptibility. Here, we show that Rsv3 restricts the accumulation of SMV strain G7 to the inoculated leaves, whereas, SMV-N, an isolate of SMV strain G2, establishes systemic infection. This observation suggests that the resistance mechanism of Rsv3 differs phenotypically from those of Rsv1 and Rsv4. To identify virulence determinant(s) of SMV on an Rsv3-genotype soybean, chimeras were constructed by exchanging fragments between avirulent SMV-G7 and the virulent SMV-N. Analyses of the chimeras showed that both the N- and C-terminal regions of the cytoplasmic inclusion (CI) cistron are required for Rsv3-mediated resistance. Interestingly, the N-terminal region of CI is also involved in severe symptom induction in soybean.
