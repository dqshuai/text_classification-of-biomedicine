Killer lectin-like receptors NKG2D and CD94 on natural killer cells trigger cytotoxicity through binding of glycans on target cells including sialyl Lewis X antigen. We previously reported that NKG2D and CD94 recognize alpha2,3-linked NeuAc on multi-antennary N-glycans. Here we further investigated polysaccharide binding by these receptors, using glutathione-S-transferase-fused extracellular domains of NKG2D AA 73-216 (rNKG2Dlec) and CD94 AA 68-179 (rCD94lec). We found that rNKG2Dlec and rCD94lec bind in a dose-dependent manner to plates coated with heparin-conjugated bovine serum albumin (heparin-BSA). Binding to heparin-BSA was suppressed by soluble sulfate-containing polysaccharides, but minimally impacted by 2-O-, 6-O-, and 2-N-desulfated heparin. Mutagenesis revealed that (152)Y and (199)Y of NKG2D and (144)F, (160)N, and (166)C of CD94 were critical for binding to heparin-BSA. The present manuscript provides the first evidence that NKG2D and CD94 bind to heparin and sulfate-containing polysaccharides.
