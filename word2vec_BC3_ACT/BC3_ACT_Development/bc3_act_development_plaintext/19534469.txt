Block copolymer mediated synthesis of dendritic platinum nanoparticles.

L Wang, Y Yamauchi

Dendritic platinum nanoparticles are straightforwardly synthesized in high yield via a one-step aqueous-phase reaction mediated by Pluronic F127 block copolymer from the reduction of a platinum complex by ascorbic acid without the need for organic solvents, templates, or ion replacements. The proposed method is unique in its simplicity. The as-prepared dendritic platinum nanoparticles possess the highest surface area (56 m(2) g(-1)) of all reported unsupported platinum materials.
