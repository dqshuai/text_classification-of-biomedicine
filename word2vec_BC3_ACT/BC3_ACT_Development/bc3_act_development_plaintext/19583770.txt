GTP cyclohydrolase II catalyzes the first dedicated step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin and appears to be a limiting factor for the production of the vitamin by recombinant Bacillus subtilis overproducer strains. Using error-prone PCR amplification, we generated a library of the B. subtilis ribA gene selectively mutated in the GTP cyclohydrolase II domain. The ratio of the GTP cyclohydrolase II to 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone synthase activities of the mutant proteins was measured. A mutant designated Construct E, carrying seven point mutations, showed a two-fold increase in GTP cyclohydrolase II activity and a four-fold increase in the K(m) value with GTP as the substrate. Using the analog 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-triphosphate as the substrate, the mutant showed a rate enhancement by a factor of about two and an increase in the K(m) value by a factor of about 5. A series of UV absorption spectra obtained in stopped-flow experiments using the wild-type and mutant enzymes revealed isosbestic points indicative of apparently perfect reactions, which were similar to the findings obtained with GTP cyclohydrolase II of Escherichia coli. Initial burst velocities obtained for the mutant and wild-type proteins were similar. The data suggest that the mutations present in Construct E are jointly conducive to the acceleration of a late step in the reaction trajectory, most probably the release of product from the enzyme.
