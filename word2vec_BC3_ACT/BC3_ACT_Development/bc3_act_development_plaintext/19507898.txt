Reversible single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation from achiral antiferromagnetic hexanuclears to a chiral ferrimagnetic double zigzag chain.

A reversible single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation from hexanuclear clusters to a one-dimensional double-zigzag chain was established. With the reversible polymerization, the chirality and magnetic interactions are switched between achiral and chiral and between antiferromagnetic in hexanuclear clusters and ferrimagnetic in chains, respectively.
