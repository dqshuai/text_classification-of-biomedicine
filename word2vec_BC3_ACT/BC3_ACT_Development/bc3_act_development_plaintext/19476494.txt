Interaction between acidic activation domains and the activator-binding domains of Swi1 and Snf5 of the yeast SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex has previously been characterized in vitro. Although deletion of both activator-binding domains leads to phenotypes that differ from the wild-type, their relative importance for SWI/SNF recruitment to target genes has not been investigated. In the present study, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to investigate the individual and collective importance of the activator-binding domains for SWI/SNF recruitment to genes within the GAL regulon in vivo. We also investigated the consequences of defective SWI/SNF recruitment for target gene activation. We demonstrate that deletion of both activator-binding domains essentially abolishes galactose-induced SWI/SNF recruitment and causes a reduction in transcriptional activation similar in magnitude to that associated with a complete loss of SWI/SNF activity. The activator-binding domains in Swi1 and Snf5 make approximately equal contributions to the recruitment of SWI/SNF to each of the genes studied. The requirement for SWI/SNF recruitment correlates with GAL genes that are highly and rapidly induced by galactose.
