Dihydroavenanthramide D (DHAvD) is a synthetic analog to naturally occurring avenanthramide, which is the active component of oat. Although its anti-inflammatory, antiatherosclerotic, and antioxidant effects have been reported, the effect of DHAvD on type 1 diabetes is unknown. Therefore, in this study, the effect of DHAvD on cytokine- or streptozotocin-induced beta-cell damage was investigated. Treatment of RINm5F insulinoma cells or isolated islets with IL-1beta and IFN-gamma induced beta-cell damage through a NF-kappaB-dependent signaling pathway. DHAvD-pretreated RINm5F cells or islets showed resistance to cytokine toxicity, namely suppressed nitric oxide (NO) production, reduced the inducible form of NO synthase expression, and decreased beta-cell destruction and the normal insulin secretion capacity. Furthermore, pretreatment with DHAvD blocked the development of type 1 diabetes in streptozotocin-treated mice. Prior injection with DHAvD maintained a normal range of plasma glucose and insulin, and retained immunoreactivity for insulin in the pancreas. These results suggest that DHAvD may be used to preserve functional beta-cell mass.
