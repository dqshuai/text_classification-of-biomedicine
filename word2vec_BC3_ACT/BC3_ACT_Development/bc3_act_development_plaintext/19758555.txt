Mechanisms of cellular protrusions branch out.

F-BAR domains bind curved membranes and induce membrane invagination. In a recent Cell paper, Guerrier et al. describe an "inverse" F-BAR family member that induces outward curvature and filopodia in migrating neurons. These findings suggest that F-BAR domains are functionally diverse and regulate different types of membrane morphology.
