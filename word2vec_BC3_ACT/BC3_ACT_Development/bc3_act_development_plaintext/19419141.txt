Discovery of 4-(5-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-methyl-3-propionyl-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)benzenesulfonamide (A-867744) as a novel positive allosteric modulator of the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

The discovery of a series of pyrrole-sulfonamides as positive allosteric modulators (PAM) of alpha7 nAChRs is described. Optimization of this series led to the identification of 19 (A-867744), a novel type II PAM with good potency and selectivity. Compound 19 showed acceptable pharmacokinetic profile across species and brain levels sufficient to modulate alpha7 nAChRs. In a rodent model of sensory gating, 19 normalized gating deficits. These results suggest that 19 represents a novel class of molecules capable of allosteric modulation of the alpha7 nAChRs.
