Vesicular stomatitis virus induces apoptosis primarily through Bak rather than Bax by inactivating Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL.

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. The mitochondrial pathway is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which consists of both pro- and antiapoptotic members. To determine the relative importance of the multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bak and Bax, HeLa cells were transfected with Bak and/or Bax small interfering RNA (siRNA) and subsequently infected with recombinant wild-type VSV. Our results showed that Bak is more important than Bax for the induction of apoptosis in this system. Bak is regulated by two antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, Mcl-1, which is rapidly turned over, and Bcl-X(L), which is relatively stable. Inhibition of host gene expression by the VSV M protein resulted in the degradation of Mcl-1 but not Bcl-X(L). However, inactivation of both Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L) was required for cells to undergo apoptosis. While inactivation of Mcl-1 was due to inhibition of its expression, inactivation of Bcl-X(L) indicates a role for one or more BH3-only Bcl-2 family members. VSV-induced apoptosis was inhibited by transfection with siRNA against Bid, a BH3-only protein that is normally activated by the cleavage of caspase-8, the initiator caspase associated with the death receptor pathway. Similarly, treatment with an inhibitor of caspase-8 inhibited VSV-induced apoptosis. These results indicate a role for cross talk from the death receptor pathway in the activation of the mitochondrial pathway by VSV.
