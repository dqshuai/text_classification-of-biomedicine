Immunity

The good fat: a link between lipid bodies and antigen cross-presentation.

M Desjardins

Antigen cross-presentation enables an efficient CD8(+) T cell response against antigens from exogenous sources. In this issue of Immunity, Bougn√®res et al. (2009) identify lipid bodies as an unexpected new player involved in this complex cellular pathway.
