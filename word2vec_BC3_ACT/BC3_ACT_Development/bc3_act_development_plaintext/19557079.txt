Tumors line up for a letdown.

JT Mendell

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and the pathways that regulate their expression have critical functions during normal development. A new study demonstrates that select cancer cells have appropriated one developmental mechanism of miRNA regulation, the inhibition of let-7 biogenesis by the Lin-28 and Lin-28B RNA binding proteins, to rid themselves of an antitumorigenic miRNA.
