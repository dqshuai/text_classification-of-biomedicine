Drosophila Minus is required for cell proliferation and influences Cyclin E turnover.

Turnover of cyclins plays a major role in oscillatory cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity and control of cell cycle progression. Here we present a novel cell cycle regulator, called minus, which influences Cyclin E turnover in Drosophila. minus mutants produce defects in cell proliferation, some of which are attributable to persistence of Cyclin E. Minus protein can interact physically with Cyclin E and the SCF Archipelago/Fbw7/Cdc4 ubiquitin-ligase complex. Minus does not affect dMyc, another known SCF(Ago) substrate in Drosophila. We propose that Minus contributes to cell cycle regulation in part by selectively controlling turnover of Cyclin E.
