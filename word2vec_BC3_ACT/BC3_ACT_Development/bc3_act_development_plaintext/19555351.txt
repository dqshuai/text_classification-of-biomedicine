Hypertension secondary to scavenging of NO remains a limitation in the use of HBOCs (haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers). Recent studies suggest that nitrite reduction to NO by deoxyhaemoglobin supports NO signalling. In the present study we tested whether nitrite would attenuate HBOC-mediated hypertension using HBOC-201 (Biopure), a bovine cross-linked, low-oxygen-affinity haemoglobin. In a similar way to unmodified haemoglobin, deoxygenated HBOC-201 reduced nitrite to NO with rates directly proportional to the extent of deoxygenation. The functional importance of HBOC-201-dependent nitrite reduction was demonstrated using isolated aortic rings and a murine model of trauma, haemorrhage and resuscitation. In the former, HBOC-201 inhibited NO-donor and nitrite-dependent vasodilation when oxygenated. However, deoxygenated HBOC-201 failed to affect nitrite-dependent vasodilation but still inhibited NO-donor dependent vasodilation, consistent with a model in which nitrite-reduction by deoxyHBOC-201 counters NO scavenging. Finally, resuscitation using HBOC-201, after trauma and haemorrhage, resulted in mild hypertension ( approximately 5-10 mmHg). Administration of a single bolus nitrite (30-100 nmol) at the onset of HBOC-201 resuscitation prevented hypertension. Nitrite had no effect on mean arterial pressure during resuscitation with LR (lactated Ringer's solution), suggesting a role for nitrite-HBOC reactions in attenuating HBOC-mediated hypertension. Taken together these data support the concept that nitrite can be used as an adjunct therapy to prevent HBOC-dependent hypertension.
