Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great interest in different research areas, stimulated by the increasing ease with large numbers of markers to gain a genome-wide perspective on differentiation. In this study, we searched for the genetic signatures of selection by screening 114 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers in three finless porpoise populations inhabiting contrasting natural environments (freshwater and marine habitat). Comparing among three populations, four AFLP loci exhibited F(ST) values higher than 0.975 quantile which might be inferred to be under divergent selection and two loci fell below the 0.025 quantile which might be affected by balancing selection. Although these loci were not supported with statistical significance in false discovery rate (FDR) analysis, the present study illustrated the potential of genome-wide surveys to identify specific genome regions or genes associated with freshwater adaptation of the finless porpoise.
