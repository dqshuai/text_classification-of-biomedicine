The scavenger receptors (SRs) comprise structurally and functionally divergent groups of cell surface and secreted proteins that play an important role in innate immune defenses. Searching translated chicken genomic databases revealed many proteins homologous to mammalian SRs. SR mediated immune functions (oxidative burst, degranulation, phagocytosis, nitric oxide (NO) production, and cytokine expression) were evaluated in chicken heterophils, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and a chicken macrophage cell line (HD11) using various SR class A and B ligands. Results showed that the SR-A ligands, fucoidan, poly(I) and poly(G), but not SR-B ligands, phosphatidylserine and LDL, stimulated dose-dependent NO production in HD11 cells. However, SR-A ligands failed to induce NO in chicken monocytes. Quantitative RT-PCR indicated that SR ligands differentially regulated the gene expression of cytokines and chemokine in HD11 cells with a strong up-regulation of the cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-6 and the chemokine MIP-1 beta, but had no effect on IL-4, IL-12, IFN-gamma, and IFN-beta. SR-B ligands did not alter expression of these genes. SR-A ligands had no stimulatory effect on functional response in heterophils. However, LDL, a SR-B ligand stimulated oxidative burst in both heterophils and PBMC. Additionally, results indicate that SRs are involved in bacterial binding in macrophages.
