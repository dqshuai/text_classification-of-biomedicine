Conformational stability and multistate unfolding of poly(A)-specific ribonuclease.

Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) specifically catalyzes the degradation of the poly(A) tails of single-stranded mRNAs in a highly processive mode. PARN participates in diverse and important intracellular processes by acting as a regulator of mRNA stability and translational efficiency. In this article, the equilibrium unfolding of PARN was studied using both guanidine hydrochloride and urea as chemical denaturants. The unfolding of PARN was characterized as a multistate process, but involving dissimilar equilibrium intermediates when denatured by the two denaturants. A comparison of the spectral characteristics of these intermediates indicated that the conformational changes at low concentrations of the chemical denaturants were more likely to be rearrangements of the tertiary and quaternary structures. In particular, an inactive molten globule-like intermediate was identified to exist as soluble non-native oligomers, and the formation of the oligomers was modulated by electrostatic interactions. An active dimeric intermediate unique to urea-induced unfolding was characterized to have increased regular secondary structures and modified tertiary structures, implying that additional regular structures could be induced by environmental stresses. The dissimilarity in the unfolding pathways induced by guanidine hydrochloride and urea suggest that electrostatic interactions play an important role in PARN stability and regulation. The appearance of multiple intermediates with distinct properties provides the structural basis for the multilevel regulation of PARN by conformational changes.
