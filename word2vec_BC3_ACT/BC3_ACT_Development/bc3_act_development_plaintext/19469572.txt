Diketiminate silicon(II) and related NHSi ligands generated in the coordination sphere of nickel(0).

A Meltzer, C Pr√§sang, M Driess

The first silicon(II) hydroxide and related electronically tunable NHSi ligands have been synthesized in the coordination sphere of a [Ni(CO)(3)] moiety through facile addition of water and other electrophiles to the corresponding NHSi-tricarbonylnickel complex. The latter modified silicon (II) ligands are unique and exhibit striking donor/acceptor capabilities depending on their substitution pattern. While strong Lewis acids [H(+) or B(C(6)F(5))(3)] lead to modified silicon(II) ligands in the coordination sphere of nickel with an increased pi-acceptor and decreased sigma-donor character (PF(3)-like), by contrast, addition of water or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid furnishes the corresponding donor-stabilized silicon(II)-nickel complexes with a inverse donor/acceptor strength similar to those of triorganophosphines and NHCs.
