Activin is a potent growth suppressor of epithelial ovarian cancer cells.

Although activin is a major cytokine produced by the ovary, its role in epithelial ovarian cancer is poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate a novel role for activin as a growth inhibitor of some (8/16) epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines. Unresponsive cell lines displayed transcriptional downregulation of the activin receptors ACTRIIA and ACTRIB, suggesting resistance to activin signalling. In response to activin, growth inhibited cell lines demonstrated activation of the canonical SMAD2/3/4, transcriptional induction of the CDK inhibitor p15INK4B, suppression of C-MYC levels and a G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Thus, activin is a potent inhibitor of proliferation of some epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines and its role in the pathogenesis of this disease needs to be re-evaluated.
