The amyloid hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease: a critical reappraisal.

J Hardy

The amyloid hypothesis has been the basis for most work on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Recent clinical trials based on this hypothesis have been inconclusive. In this article I review the current status of the hypothesis and suggest that a major scientific need is to understand the normal function of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and think how this may relate to the cell death in the disease process.
