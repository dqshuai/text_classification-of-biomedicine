Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces extracellular glycerophosphoinositol through phospholipase-mediated turnover of phosphatidylinositol and transports glycerophosphoinositol into the cell upon nutrient limitation. A screening identified the RAS GTPase-activating proteins Ira1 and Ira2 as required for utilization of glycerophosphoinositol as the sole phosphate source, but the RAS/cyclic AMP pathway does not appear to be involved in the growth phenotype. Ira1 and Ira2 affect both the production and transport of glycerophosphoinositol.
