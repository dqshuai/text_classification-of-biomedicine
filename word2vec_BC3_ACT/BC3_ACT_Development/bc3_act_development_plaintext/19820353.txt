Conversion of glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is one of the highly conserved steps of glycerol metabolism in evolutionary diverse organisms. In plants, G3P is produced either via the glycerol kinase (GK)-mediated phosphorylation of glycerol, or via G3P dehydrogenase (G3Pdh)-mediated reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). We have recently shown that G3P levels contribute to basal resistance against the hemibiotrophic pathogen, Colletotrichum higginsianum. Since a mutation in the GLY1-encoded G3Pdh conferred more susceptibility compared to a mutation in the GLI1-encoded GK, we proposed that GLY1 is the major contributor of the total G3P pool that participates in defense against C. higginsianum.
