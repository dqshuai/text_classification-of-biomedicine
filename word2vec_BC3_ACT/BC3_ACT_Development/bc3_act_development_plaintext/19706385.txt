The recent progress made in the bioengineering of cardiac patches offers a new therapeutic modality for regenerating the myocardium after myocardial infarction (MI). We present here a strategy for the engineering of a cardiac patch with mature vasculature by heterotopic transplantation onto the omentum. The patch was constructed by seeding neonatal cardiac cells with a mixture of prosurvival and angiogenic factors into an alginate scaffold capable of factor binding and sustained release. After 48 h in culture, the patch was vascularized for 7 days on the omentum, then explanted and transplanted onto infarcted rat hearts, 7 days after MI induction. When evaluated 28 days later, the vascularized cardiac patch showed structural and electrical integration into host myocardium. Moreover, the vascularized patch induced thicker scars, prevented further dilatation of the chamber and ventricular dysfunction. Thus, our study provides evidence that grafting prevascularized cardiac patch into infarct can improve cardiac function after MI.
