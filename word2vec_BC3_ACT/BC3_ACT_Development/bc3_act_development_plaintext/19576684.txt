We investigated the genotype distribution of the p53 Arg72Pro polymorphisms in 500 cervical carcinoma and 800 normal women in Chinese population. HPV infection rates in carcinoma patients and control were 89.4% and 31.0%. Women carrying the p53 Arg72Pro or p53 Pro72Pro increased the risk of cervical carcinoma (ORs and 95% CIs being 3.74 (2.65-5.30), 2.23 (1.49-3.34)). In HPV positive population, elevated risks were also associated with p53 Arg72Pro, Pro72Pro (ORs and 95% CIs being 3.83 (2.02-7.24), 2.38 (1.14-4.99)). These results suggest that a proline in position 72 of p53 increases the risk of cervical carcinoma in Chinese population.
