PURPOSE: To examine the distribution and systemic determinants of ocular biometry as measured using partial laser interferometry in an adult Asian population. METHODS: A population-based, cross-sectional study of 3280 persons (78.7% participation rate) ages 40 to 80 years, of Malay ethnicity residing in Singapore, was conducted. Axial ocular dimensions, including axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and corneal curvature (CC), were determined with partial laser interferometry. Participants had a comprehensive interview and a standardized examination. RESULTS: After 492 persons were excluded who had undergone cataract surgery, data on 2788 subjects were available. The mean AL, ACD, and CC were 23.55, 3.10, and 7.65 mm, respectively. AL and ACD decreased with increasing age. In multivariate models that adjusted for age, sex, education, height, weight, number of reading hours, diabetes, and current smoking, longer AL was associated with being male, height, increasing weight, higher education levels, and total reading hours. Increasing CC was associated with greater age and greater height and weight after multivariable adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Age, sex, and stature were the most consistent predictors of the results of ocular biometry in the Singapore Malay adult population.
