Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is present in the nucleus, the cytosol and in mitochondria. The rat ERalpha ligand binding domain was employed as bait in a bacterial two-hybrid screening of a human heart cDNA library to detect novel protein-protein interaction partners of ERalpha in the heart. 17beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (17beta-HSD10), which converts potent (17beta-estradiol) to less potent estrogens (estrone), co-localized with 17beta-HSD10 in the mitochondria of rat cardiac myocytes. GST pull-down experiments confirmed the interaction of ERalpha and 17beta-HSD10. These findings suggest that the ERalpha estrogen receptor might be involved in regulating intracellular estrogen levels by modulating 17beta-HSD10 activity.
