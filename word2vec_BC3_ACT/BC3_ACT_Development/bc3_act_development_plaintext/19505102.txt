Directed formation of lipid membrane microdomains as high affinity sites for His-tagged proteins.

CC Hayden, JS Hwang, EA Abate, MS Kent, DY Sasaki

Lipid membranes composed of an iminodiacetic acid functionalized lipid, DSIDA, in a POPC matrix exhibited switchable properties via Cu(2+) recognition to rapidly assemble microdomains that act as high affinity sites for His-tagged proteins. The microdomains demonstrated an order of magnitude enhanced affinity for the proteins compared to homogeneously functionalized POPC membranes with Ni(2+)-NTA DOGS or Cu(2+)-DOIDA, while a rapid release and restoration of the original membrane was accomplished with micromolar concentrations of EDTA.
