Highly diastereo- and enantioselective Pd-catalyzed cyclopropanation of acyclic amides with substituted allyl carbonates.

W Liu, D Chen, XZ Zhu, XL Wan, XL Hou

A highly diastereo- and enantioselective cyclopropanation reaction was realized in the reaction of acyclic amides with monosubstituted allyl carbonates via Pd-catalysis using a ferrocene ligand with H as a substituent on an oxazoline ring, providing cyclopropane products having three chiral centers in yields of 67-83%, the dr ratio being 4-23:1, and ee being 83-97%. The presence of LiCl is important for the gain of high diastereo- and enantioselectivities of the reaction.
