Frequent promoter hypermethylation and transcriptional downregulation of BTG4 gene in gastric cancer.

The BTG4 gene belongs to the BTG family of genes endowed with antiproliferative properties. In this study, we have found that BTG4 undergoes promoter CpG island hypermethylation-associated inactivation in gastric cancer and 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) treatment restores BTG4 expression. We also found BTG4 levels were significantly reduced in primary gastric cancer but not in normal gastric tissues. BTG4 reexpression in gastric cancer causes growth inhibition of colony assays and nude mice. Taken together, our data support BTG4 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene that is epigenetically silenced in the majority of gastric cancers.
