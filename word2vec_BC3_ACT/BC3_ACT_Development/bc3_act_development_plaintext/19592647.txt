Intestinal APCs are considered critical in maintaining the balance between the response against harmful pathogens and the induction of tolerance to commensal bacteria and food Ags. Recently, several studies indicated the presence of gut-specific APC subsets, which possess both macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) markers. These unique APC subsets play important roles in gut immunity, especially for immune regulation against commensal bacteria. Herein, we examined a unique macrophage subset, which coexpressed the macrophage (Mphi) marker CD14 and the DC marker CD209 in human intestinal lamina propria (LP). The LP Mphi subset in both normal control subjects or Crohn's disease (CD) patients induced proliferation of naive CD4(+) T cells as well as monocyte-derived DCs, and it expressed retinoic acid synthetic enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 and retinol dehydrogenase 10, which induced expression of gut homing receptors on T cells in a retinoic acid-dependent manner. Moreover, the LP Mphi subset strongly evoked differentiation of Th1 cells and slightly induced Th17 cells in both normal control subjects and CD patients; the inducing potential was highest in CD patients. In CD patients, Th17, but not Th1, induction by the LP Mphi subset was enhanced in the presence of commensal bacteria Ags. This enhancement was not observed in normal control subjects. The Th17 induction by the LP Mphi subset was inhibited by neutralization of IL-6 and IL-1beta, but it was enhanced by blockade of retinoic acid signaling. These observations highlight a role for LP Mphi in the enhanced Th1, and potentially in Th17 differentiation, at the inflammatory site of inflammatory bowel diseases.
