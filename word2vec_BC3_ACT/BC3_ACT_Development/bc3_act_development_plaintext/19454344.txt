Influenza A virus TRIMs the type I interferon response.

S Ludwig, T Wolff

The virulence of many pathogenic viruses depends on suppression of the innate type I interferon defense. For influenza viruses, a unique strategy has now been unraveled, as the viral nonstructural protein 1 was shown to inhibit activation of the pathogen recognition receptor RIG-I by binding the ubiquitin ligase TRIM25.
