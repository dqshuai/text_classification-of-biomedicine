Evidence for Pt(II)-based molecular catalysis in the thermal reduction of water into molecular hydrogen.

K Yamauchi, S Masaoka, K Sakai

The one-electron-reduced form of methylviologen (MV(+*)), generated in situ by bulk electrolysis of methylviologen (MV(2+)), was for the first time reacted with various Pt(II) complexes in aqueous media without light irradiation to reveal that thermal reduction of water into molecular hydrogen is indeed highly promoted by the Pt(II)-based molecular catalysts.
