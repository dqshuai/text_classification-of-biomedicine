Temperature-regulation of plant architecture.

D Patel, KA Franklin

As sessile organisms, plants have evolved great plasticity to adapt to their surrounding environment. Temperature signals regulate the timing of multiple developmental processes and have dramatic effects on plant architecture and biomass. The modulation of plant architecture by temperature is of increasing relevance with regard to crop productivity and global climate change. Unlike many other organisms, the mechanisms through which plants sense changes in ambient temperature remain elusive. Multiple studies have identified crosstalk between ambient temperature sensing, light signaling, cold acclimation and pathogen response pathways. The regulation of plant architecture by temperature appears to involve the complex integration of multiple hormone signaling networks. Gibberellin (GA), Salicylic Acid (SA) and cytokinin have been implicated in the regulation of plant growth during chilling, whilst a predominant role for auxin is observed at high temperatures. This mini-review summarizes current knowledge of plant growth regulation by temperature and crosstalk with other abiotic and biotic stress signaling pathways.
