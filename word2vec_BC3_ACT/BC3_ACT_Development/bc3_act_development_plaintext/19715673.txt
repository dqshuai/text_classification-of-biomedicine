Vascular PTPs: current developments and challenges for exploitation in Type 2 diabetes-associated vascular dysfunction.

D Popov

Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (PTPs) are important contributors to vascular cells normal function, by balancing signaling proteins activation exerted by phosphorylating kinases. Type 2 diabetes related insults, such as hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance disturb the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation equilibrium towards an abnormal augmented phosphorylation of signaling proteins associated with changes in PTPs expression, enzymatic activity and interaction with cellular substrates. We briefly review here: (i) the new findings on receptor and non-receptor PTPs and their role in vascular cells, (ii) several data on oxidation and phosphorylation of these molecules in endothelial and smooth muscle cells, (iii) vascular PTPs intrinsic activity and dysregulation under the insults of diabetic milieu, and (iv) the potential use of PTPs and their inhibitors as therapeutic targets in Type 2 diabetes-associated vascular dysfunction.
