The lethal ventricular arrhythmia Torsade de pointes (TdP) is the most common reason for the withdrawal or restricted use of many cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular drugs. The lack of an in vitro model to detect pro-arrhythmic effects on human heart cells hinders the development of new drugs. We hypothesized that recently established human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells could be used in an in vitro drug screening model. In this study, hiPS cells were driven to differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes, which expressed cardiac markers including Nkx2.5, GATA4, and atrial natriuretic peptide. The hiPS-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs) were analyzed using a multi electrode assay. The application of ion channel inhibitors resulted in dose-dependent changes to the field potential waveform, and these changes were identical to those induced in the native cardiomyocytes. This study shows that hiPS-CMs represent a promising in vitro model for cardiac electrophysiologic studies and drug screening.
