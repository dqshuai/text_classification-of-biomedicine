In the present study, we investigated whether human adipose tissue derived stem cells (hASCs) could enhance tumor invasion and whether these hASCs could be a potential source of CCL5. We observed a significant increase in the number of breast cancer cells that invaded the matrigel when Co-cultured with hASCs. We found that hASCs produce CCL5 in the Co-culture and cancer cell invasion was diminished by an antibody against CCL5. Furthermore, cancer cell invasion in the Co-culture was associated with an elevated level of MMP-9 activity. We conclude that CCL5 plays a crucial role for tumor invasion in the interplay of tissue resident stem cells from the fat tissue and breast cancer cells.
