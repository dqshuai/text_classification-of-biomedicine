Neuroimage analysis in alcoholic corpus callosum (CC) suggests that microstructural abnormalities are higher in the genu followed by the body and the splenium. Molecular mechanisms underlying these dysmorphologys are still unclear. Protein expression was performed using the CC body samples [(nine controls, seven uncomplicated, and six complicated (with liver cirrhosis) alcoholics] through proteomics approach. Thirty-nine protein spots in uncomplicated and 60 in complicated alcoholics were differentially altered compared with the control (p < 0.05). Comparison between alcoholic groups revealed that 40% more protein showed altered expression in complicated compared with uncomplicated. This result suggests that alcohol-related liver dysfunction has synergetic effects on brain protein expression. Subregional expression profiles indicate that the highest numbers of region-specific proteins were in the genus followed by the CC body and the splenium. Interestingly, abnormal thiamine cascade was strongly suggested in the genu, and to a lesser extent in the CC body, but no such cascade was observed in the splenium. Therefore, alcohol-induced microstructural damage detected by image analysis in the CC, possibly involves multiple biochemical mechanisms.
