Seven-coordinate homoleptic metal carbonyls in the gas phase.

AM Ricks, ZD Reed, MA Duncan

Gas-phase metal carbonyl cations of the vanadium-group metals (V(+), Nb(+), Ta(+)) were produced in a molecular beam by laser vaporization and then mass-analyzed and size-selected in a time-of-flight spectrometer and studied with IR laser photodissociation spectroscopy in the carbonyl-stretching region. The abundances in the mass spectra, the fragmentation patterns, and the IR spectra provided a combined approach that revealed the coordination numbers in these systems. Although seven-coordinate structures would have 18 electrons in each case, V(CO)(6)(+) was found to be formed rather than V(CO)(7)(+). Nb(+) formed both six- and seven-coordinate species, while Ta(+) formed only the Ta(CO)(7)(+) complex. Density functional theory computations were used to predict the IR spectra for these systems, which are dramatically different for the six- and seven-coordinate structures and in excellent agreement with the measurements. V(CO)(6)(+) and Nb(CO)(6)(+) have structures slightly distorted from octahedral, while Nb(CO)(7)(+) and Ta(CO)(7)(+) have C(3v) capped octahedral structures.
