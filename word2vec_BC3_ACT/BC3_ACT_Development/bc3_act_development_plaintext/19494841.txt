To determine the pattern of genetic alterations in primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL), 19 PCNSL were studied by high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Recurrent losses involved 6p21.32, 6q21, 8q12-12.2, 9p21.3, 3p14.2, 4q35.2, 10q23.21 and 12p13.2, whereas gains involved 18q21-23, 19q13.31, 19q13.43 and the entire chromosomes X and 12. Partial uniparental disomies (pUPDs) were identified in 6p and 9p21.3. These genomic alterations affected the HLA locus, the CDKN2A/p16, CDKN2B/p15 and MTAP, as well as the PRDM1, FAS, MALT1, and BCL2 genes. Increased methylation values of the CDKN2A/p16 promoter region were detected in 75% (6/8) PCNSL. Gene expression profiling showed 4/21 (20%) minimal common regions of imbalances to be associated with a differential mRNA expression affecting the FAS, STAT6, CD27, ARHGEF6 and SEPT6 genes. Collectively, this study unraveled novel genomic imbalances and pUPD with a high resolution in PCNSL and identified target genes of potential relevance in the pathogenesis of this lymphoma entity.
