Factor VII activating protease (FSAP) is associated with cardiovascular diseases and liver fibrosis. To understand the regulation of its proteolytic activity we have characterized recombinant FSAP-mutants over-expressed in HEK-293 cells. The secreted FSAP-protein concentration correlated inversely with the enzymatic activity of the FSAP-mutants. Over-expression of enzymatically active FSAP decreased cell viability, whereas inactive variants were expressed and secreted in adequate amounts. The naturally occurring G534E-variant exhibited reduced proteolytic activity. The DeltaEGF-3 mutant showed diminished binding to and activation by heparin. Hence, regulation of FSAP activity is dependent on its EGF-3 domain and over-expression of active variants induces cell death.
