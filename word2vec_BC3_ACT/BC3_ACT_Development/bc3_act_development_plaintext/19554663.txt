Palliative cardia resection with gastroesophageal reconstruction for perforated carcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction.

S Gillen, H Friess, J Kleeff

Iatrogenic perforation of esophageal cancer or cancer of the gastroesophageal (GE) junction is a serious complication that, in addition to short term morbidity and mortality, significantly compromises the success of any subsequent oncological therapy. Here, we present an 82-year-old man with iatrogenic perforation of adenocarcinoma of the GE junction. Immediate surgical intervention included palliative resection and GE reconstruction. In the case of iatrogenic tumor perforation, the primary goal should be adequate palliative (and not oncological) therapy. The different approaches for iatrogenic perforation, i.e. surgical versus endoscopic therapy are discussed.
