The use of combinatorial peptide ligand libraries, containing hexapeptides terminating with a primary amine, or modified with a terminal carboxyl group, allowed discovering and identifying a large number of previously unreported proteins in cow's whey. Whereas comprehensive whey protein lists progressively increased in the last 6 years from 17 unique gene products to more than 100, our findings have considerably expanded this list to a total of 149 unique protein species, of which 100 were not described in previous proteomics studies. As an additional interesting result, a polymorphic alkaline protein was observed with a strong positive signal when blotted from an isoelectric focusing separation in gel and tested with sera of allergic patients. This polymorphic protein, found only after treatment with the peptide library, was identified as an immunoglobulin (Ig), a minor allergen that had been largely amplified. The list of cow's whey components here reported is by far the most comprehensive at present and could serve as a starting point for the functional characterization of low-abundance proteins possibly having novel pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and biomedical applications.
