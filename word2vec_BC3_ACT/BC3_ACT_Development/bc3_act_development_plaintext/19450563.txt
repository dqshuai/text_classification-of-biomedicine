Sauchinone, a lignan compound isolated from the root of Saururus chinensis, has been recently demonstrated to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity via the suppression of NF-kB p65 activity in vitro. In an effort to evaluate the in vivo anti-inflammatory function of sauchinone, we have evaluated the effects of sauchinone on allergen-induced airway inflammation using a murine model of allergic asthma. We observed that marked eosinophilic and lymphocyte infiltration in the BAL fluid were suppressed to a significant degree by sauchinone, and that mucus-secreting goblet cell hyperplasia and collagen deposition in the airways were also ameliorated by administration of sauchinone treatment. Moreover, gene expression of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-13, and IL-5 and eotaxin in the lung, and IL-5 in the draining lymph node were significantly decreased in sauchinone-treated mice. We demonstrated that sauchinone repressed Th2 cell development in vitro and IL-4 production by Th2 cells, and also inhibited GATA-3-mediated IL-5 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, sauchinone ameliorated allergen-induced airway inflammation, in part, by repressing GATA-3 activity for Th2 cell development, indicating the possible therapeutic potential of sauchinone in airway inflammatory diseases including allergic asthma and rhinitis.
