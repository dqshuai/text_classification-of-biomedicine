SlyA, a MarR family transcriptional regulator, controls an assortment of biological functions in several animal-pathogenic bacteria. In order to elucidate the functions of SlyA in the phytopathogen Dickeya dadantii (formerly Erwinia chrysanthemi) 3937, a slyA gene deletion mutant (denoted DeltaslyA) was constructed. The mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to sodium hypochlorite, the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B, and oxidative stress. The mutant showed reduced production of pectate lyase and exopolysaccharide and an inability to form a pellicle. The mutant lacking a functional slyA gene showed a significantly reduced ability to cause maceration of potato tubers. Accordingly, the mutant exhibited significantly reduced bacterial growth and failed to hyperinduce pectate lyase production in planta. Introduction of a plasmid containing slyA into the DeltaslyA mutant caused all of these phenotypes to recover to wild-type levels. These results suggest that SlyA plays an important role in virulence to plants by positively regulating the expression of multiple pathogenicity-related traits of D. dadantii 3937.
