The mechanism of monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (MGlcDG) increase following heat shock in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was examined by measuring MGlcDG synthase (Sll1377) activity. Temperature-dependent activation of Sll1377 was observed in the membrane fraction of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, whereas the Sll1377 protein level remained unchanged, suggesting that the activity is post-translationally regulated without covalent modification of Sll1377 by soluble enzymes. Four individual mutations introduced into recombinant Sll1377 (D147, D200, R329, and R331) significantly reduced the activity and blocked temperature-dependent activation, suggesting that these amino acid residues are essential for Sll1377 activity at both normal growth temperature and the higher temperature.
