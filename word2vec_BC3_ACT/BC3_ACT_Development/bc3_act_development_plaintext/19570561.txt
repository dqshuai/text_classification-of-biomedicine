For some patients infection with Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) causes a severe disease characterized by fever, vascular leakage and coagulopathy. Knowledge of CCHF pathogenesis is limited and today there is no information about the specific target cells of CCHFV. In this study we analyzed the permissiveness of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) including monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) to CCHFV infection. Interestingly, we found that moDCs are the most permissive to CCHFV infection and this infection induced cytokine release from moDCs. Furthermore, supernatants from infected moDCs were found to activate human endothelial cells.
