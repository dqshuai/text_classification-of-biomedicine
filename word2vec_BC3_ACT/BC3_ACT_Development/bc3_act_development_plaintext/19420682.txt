Thermo-stable nature of aromatic monoamine-dependent superoxide-generating activity of human prion-derived Cu-binding peptides.

K Yokawa, T Kagenishi, T Kawano

Human prion protein has four distinct Cu-binding motifs that catalyze the generation of superoxide coupled to oxidation of phenols and amines. Here, the thermostability of the superoxide-generating prion-derived peptides was tested. Among the peptides tested, two maintained high catalytic activity even after heating and repeated freezing/thawing cycles. The biological roles for these thermostable catalysts are discussed.
