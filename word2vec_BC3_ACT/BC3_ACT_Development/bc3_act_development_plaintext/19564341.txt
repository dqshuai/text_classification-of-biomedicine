Although natural Abs (NAbs) are present from birth, little is known about what drives their selection and whether they have housekeeping functions. The prototypic T15-NAb, first identified because of its protective role in infection, is representative of a special type of NAb response that specifically recognizes and forms complexes with apoptotic cells and which promotes cell-corpse engulfment by phagocytes. We now show that this T15-NAb IgM-mediated clearance process is dependent on the recruitment of C1q and mannose-binding lectin, which have known immune modulatory activities that also provide "eat me" signals for enhancing phagocytosis. Further investigation revealed that the addition of T15-NAb significantly suppressed in vitro LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion by the macrophage-like cell line, RAW264.7, as well as TLR3-, TLR4-, TLR7-, and TLR9-induced maturation and secretion of a range of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by bone marrow-derived conventional dendritic cells. Significantly, high doses of this B-1 cell produced NAb also suppressed in vivo TLR-induced proinflammatory responses. Although infusions of apoptotic cells also suppressed such in vivo inflammatory responses and this effect was associated with the induction of high levels of IgM antiapoptotic cell Abs, apoptotic cell treatment was not effective at suppressing such TLR responses in B cell-deficient mice. Moreover, infusions of T15-NAb also efficiently inhibited both collagen-induced arthritis and anti-collagen II Ab-mediated arthritis. These studies identify and characterize a previously unknown regulatory circuit by which a NAb product of innate-like B cells aids homeostasis by control of fundamental inflammatory pathways.
