Palladium-catalyzed enantioselective alpha-arylation and alpha-vinylation of oxindoles facilitated by an axially chiral P-stereogenic ligand.

AM Taylor, RA Altman, SL Buchwald

The enantioselective alpha-arylation and alpha-vinylation of oxindoles catalyzed by Pd and a biarylmonophosphine ligand with both axial and phosphorus-based chirogenicity is reported. The resultant quaternary carbon stereocenters are formed in high enantiomeric excess, and the conditions tolerate a range of substitution on both the oxindole and the aryl/vinyl coupling partners.
