Glycine transporter 1 associates with cholesterol-rich membrane raft microdomains.

X Liu, AD Mitrovic, RJ Vandenberg

Membrane rafts, the highly-ordered, cholesterol-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane play important roles in cellular functions. In this study, GLYT1-CFP and GLYT2-CFP were constructed, followed by investigation of whether the tagged transporters associate with a fluorescence probe that labels membrane rafts (DilC16) by using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer. A close association was observed between DiIC16 and GLYT1-CFP, but not for GLYT2-CFP. The glycine transport ability of GLYT1 is also highly dependent on the integrity of this area. Together, the results suggest that GLYT1 and membrane rafts are co-localized in the membrane, and that this influences the rate of glycine transport.
