Super-coil me: sizing up centromeric nucleosomes.

E Hill, R Williams

Every chromosome needs a centromere for proper segregation during cell division. Centromeric chromatin wraps around histones, providing an anchor for kinetochore proteins and spindle attachment. It is clear why cells need centromeres, but how they form and what they look like is less so. Recent reports extend our understanding of chaperones involved in centromere formation. And other accounts of half-sized, right-handed nucleosomes have created an unexpected twist.
