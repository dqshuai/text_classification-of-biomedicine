Treatment of bovine pulmonary smooth muscle cells with the TxA(2) mimetic, U46619 stimulated [Ca(2+)](i), which was inhibited upon pretreatment with apocynin (NADPH oxidase inhibitor). Pretreatment with cromakalim (K(V) channel opener) or nifedepine (L-VOCC inhibitor) inhibited U46619 induced increase in [Ca(2+)](i), indicating a role of K(V)-LVOCC axis in this scenario. Neither cromakalim nor nifedepine inhibited U46619 induced increase in NADPH oxidase activity, suggesting that the NADPH oxidase activation is proximal to the K(V)-LVOCC axis in the cells. Pretreatment with calphostin C (PKC inhibitor) markedly reduced U46619 induced increase in NADPH oxidase activity and [Ca(2+)](i) in the cells. Calphostin C pretreatment also markedly reduced p(47phox) phosphorylation and translocation to the membrane and association with p(22phox), a component of Cyt.b(558) of NADPH oxidase in the membrane. Overall, PKC plays an important role in NADPH oxidase derived O(2)(-)-mediated regulation of K(V)-LVOCC axis leading to an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) by U46619 in the cells.
