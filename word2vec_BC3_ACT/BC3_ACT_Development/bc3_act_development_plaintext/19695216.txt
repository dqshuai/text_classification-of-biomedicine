This study examined the question of whether deficiency of xCT, a cystine-transporter gene, exacerbates ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute renal failure (ARF). Two weeks after the right nephrectomy of male mice at 16-18weeks of age, the left renal vessels were clamped for 45min to induce renal ischemia. After (24h) induction of ischemia, xCT(-/-) mice had elevated concentrations of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine indicative of ARF, while in xCT(+/-) and xCT(+/+) mice, these parameters did not differ from the sham-operated mice. Immunohistochemical analyses of kidneys using antibodies against the oxidative stress markers revealed stronger staining in xCT(-/-) mice compared with xCT(+/+) mice. Induction of xCT mRNA in the kidneys of xCT(+/+) mice was demonstrated using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis and was further confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR. These data provide the first in vivo evidence that xCT is induced by oxidative stress and helps prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury to kidneys.
