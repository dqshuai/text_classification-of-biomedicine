Reproductive biology: receptor-like kinases orchestrate love songs in plants.

F Berger

Genetic studies have identified a family of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) involved in the control of reproduction in the model plant Arabidopsis. Each RLK-dependent signaling pathway is active in cells associated with either male or female gametes. Collectively, these RLKs control the delivery of sperm cells to female gametes.
