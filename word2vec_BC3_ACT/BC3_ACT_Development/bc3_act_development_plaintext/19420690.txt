Cofactor recycling for selective enzymatic biotransformation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol.

P Zucca, M Littarru, A Rescigno, E Sanjust

The enzymatic, selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol is reported here. Yeast alcohol dehydrogenase was used in a substrate-coupled process with cofactor recycling. Both 100% selectivity and aldehyde conversion were achieved within 3 h. The reaction took place under very mild conditions, in the absence of toxic organic solvent. The overall process proved inexpensive and deserves further optimization studies in order to evaluate industrial applications.
