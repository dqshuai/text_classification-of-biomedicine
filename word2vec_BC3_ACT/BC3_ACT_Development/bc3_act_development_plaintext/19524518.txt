Synaptobrevin, sphingolipids, and secretion: lube 'n' go at the synapse.

M Verhage, G van Meer

For neurotransmitter release to occur, proteins and lipids have to work together. The classical view of this process is that a variety of proteins work hard to force the unwilling, fusion-aversive lipids into merging. In this issue of Neuron, a study by Darios et al. paints the opposite picture: a lipid metabolite stimulates the reluctant vSNARE synaptobrevin to engage in fusogenic protein complexes.
