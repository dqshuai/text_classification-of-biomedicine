Amidine dications: isolation and [Fe]-hydrogenase-related hydrogenation.

MJ Corr, KF Gibson, AR Kennedy, JA Murphy

This communication demonstrates the preparation, isolation, and full characterization of superelectrophilic salts based on amidine dications in organic solvent, as their triflate salts. These dications are highly activated toward regiospecific reaction with hydrogen gas under mild conditions in the presence of a metal catalyst (Pd/C), mimicking the behavior of the natural substrate, N(5),N(10)-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin, in the iron-sulfur cluster-free [Fe]-hydrogenase.
