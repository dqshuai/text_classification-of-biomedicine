An uphill battle toward pluripotency.

T Graf

The discovery that a cocktail of transcription factors can reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells keeps revealing new secrets of cell fate specification. A new study with hematopoietic cells shows that progenitor cells are far more susceptible than differentiated cells to reprogramming.
