LIN28 lets BLIMP1 take the right course.

MM Matzuk

The transcription factor BLIMP1 is a master regulator of primordial germ cell (PGC) specification and is suppressed by the microRNA let-7. In a recent issue of Nature, West and colleagues use a unique in vitro ES cell differentiation strategy to show that LIN28 is an essential regulator of PGC formation through inhibition of let-7 maturation and consequential induction of BLIMP1.
