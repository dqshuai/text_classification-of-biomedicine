Hypoxia: a novel function for VIN3.

DM Bond, ES Dennis, EJ Finnegan

VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3) encodes a PHD domain chromatin remodelling protein that is induced in response to cold and is required for the establishment of the vernalization response in Arabidopsis thaliana. Vernalization is the acquisition of the competence to flower after exposure to prolonged low temperatures, which in Arabidopsis is associated with the epigenetic repression of the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). During vernalization VIN3 binds to the chromatin of the FLC locus, and interacts with conserved components of Polycomb-group Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). This complex catalyses the tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a repressive chromatin mark that increases at the FLC locus as a result of vernalization. In our recent paper we found that VIN3 is also induced by hypoxic conditions, and as is the case with low temperatures, induction occurs in a quantitative manner. Our experiments indicated that VIN3 is required for the survival of Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to low oxygen conditions. We suggested that the function of VIN3 during low oxygen conditions is likely to involve the mediation of chromatin modifications at certain loci that help the survival of Arabidopsis in response to prolonged hypoxia. Here we discuss the implications of our observations and hypotheses in terms of epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene regulation in response to hypoxia.
