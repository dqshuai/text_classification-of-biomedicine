Combined en bloc liver/pancreas transplantation (CLPT) was used primarily in the treatment of otherwise non-resectable upper abdominal malignancy. In fact, a more appropriate indication is in patients with liver disease and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Here, we report on two successful cases of CLPT at our hospital. One was a patient with non-resectable advanced liver cancer. The recipient survived for 23 mo and finally died of recurrent tumor. The other was a patient with severe biliary complication after orthotopic liver transplantation and preoperative IDDM. We performed CLPT with a modified surgical technique of preserving the native pancreas. He is currently liver-disease- and insulin-free more than 27 mo post-transplant. Based on our experience in two cases of abdominal cluster transplantation, we describe the technical details of CLPT and a modification of the surgical procedure.
