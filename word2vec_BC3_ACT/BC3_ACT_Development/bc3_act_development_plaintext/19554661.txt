LJ Huang, Q Zhu, M Lei, Q Cao

AIM: To investigate immunosuppressive agents used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in East China. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, involving 227 patients with IBD admitted to Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University from June 2000 to December 2007. Data regarding demographic, clinical characteristics and immunosuppressants usage were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 227 eligible patients were evaluated in this study, including 104 patients with Crohn's disease and 123 with ulcerative colitis. Among the patients, 61 had indications for immunosuppressive agents use. However, only 21 (34.4%) received immunosuppressive agents. Among the 21 patients, 6 (37.5%) received a subtherapeutic dose of azathioprine with no attempt to increase the dosage. Of the 20 patients that received immunosuppressive agent treatment longer than 6 mo, 15 patients went into remission, four patients were not affected and one relapsed. Among these 20 patients, four patients suffered from myelotoxicity and one suffered from hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Immunosuppressive agents are used less frequently to treat IBD patients from East China compared with Western countries. Monitoring immunosuppressive agent use is recommended to optimize dispensation of drugs for IBD in China.
