Strategies for performing genotype-phenotype association studies in nonhuman primates.

Anthropoid primate models offer opportunities to study genetic influence on alcohol consumption and alcohol-related intermediate phenotypes in socially and behaviorally complex animal models that are closely related to humans, and in which functionally equivalent or orthologous genetic variants exist. This review will discuss the methods commonly used for performing candidate gene-based studies in rhesus macaques in order to model how functional genetic variation moderates risk for human psychiatric disorders. Various in silico and in vitro approaches to identifying functional genetic variants for performance of these studies will be discussed. Next, I will provide examples of how this approach can be used for performing candidate gene-based studies and for examining gene by environment interactions. Finally, these approaches will then be placed in the context of how function-guided studies can inform us of genetic variants that may be under selection across species, demonstrating how functional genetic variants that may have conferred selective advantage at some point in the evolutionary history of humans could increase risk for addictive disorders in modern society.
