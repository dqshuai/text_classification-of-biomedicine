AIM: To investigate the role of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-7 (IGFBP-7) in the activation and transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) in vitro. METHODS: Rat HSC-T6 cells were cultured in separate dishes and treated with various concentration of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1), IGFBP-7 or anti-IGFBP-7 antibody for 24 h. The supernatant or a cytoplasm suspension was obtained from cultured HSC, followed by transfer of cells to form cell-coated dishes. Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting were used to analyze the expression of IGFBP-7 induced by TGF-beta(1) and the level of fibronectin, collagen I and alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA). The pro-apoptotic effect of anti-IGFBP-7 antibody was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting revealed that the expression of IGFBP-7 in TGF-beta(1) treated HSC was significantly up-regulated compared to that in the control group. In addition, fibronectin, collagen I and alpha-SMA also showed enhanced expression in accordance with the transdifferentiation process in a dose-dependent manner to some extent. Moreover, flow cytometry suggested that anti-IGFBP-7 antibody induced apoptosis of activated HSC, which is responsible for the development of liver fibrosis, and may represent a novel pathway and target for therapeutic intervention. CONCLUSION: IGFBP-7 showed increased expression in activated HSC and played an important role in the activation and transdifferentiation process of HSC. Anti-IGFBP-7 antibody may ameliorate liver fibrogenesis.
