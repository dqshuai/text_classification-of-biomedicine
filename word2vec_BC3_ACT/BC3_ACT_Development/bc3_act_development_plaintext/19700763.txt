This study aimed at identifying transcriptional changes associated to neuronal differentiation induced by six distinct stimuli using whole-genome microarray hybridization analysis. Bioinformatics analyses revealed the clustering of these six stimuli into two categories, suggesting separate gene/pathway dependence. Treatment with specific inhibitors demonstrated the requirement of both Janus kinase and microtubule-associated protein kinase activation to trigger differentiation with nerve growth factor (NGF) and dibutyryl cAMP. Conversely, activation of protein kinase A, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase alpha, and mammalian target of rapamycin, although required for dibutyryl cAMP-induced differentiation, exerted a negative feedback on NGF-induced differentiation. We identified Polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2) and poliovirus receptor (PVR) as indispensable for NGF-driven neuronal differentiation and alphaB-crystallin (Cryab) as an inhibitor of this process. Silencing of Plk2 or PVR blocked NGF-triggered differentiation and Cryab down-regulation, while silencing of Cryab enhanced NGF-induced differentiation. Our results position both Plk2 and PVR upstream of the negative regulator Cryab in the pathway(s) leading to neuronal differentiation triggered by NGF.
