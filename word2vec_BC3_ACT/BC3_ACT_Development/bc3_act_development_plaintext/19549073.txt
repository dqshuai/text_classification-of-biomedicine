Parkin mutations in humans produce parkinsonism whose pathogenesis is related to impaired protein degradation, increased free radicals and abnormal neurotransmitter release. In this study, we have investigated whether partial proteasomal inhibition by epoxomicin, an ubiquitin proteasomal system (UPS) irreversible inhibitor, further aggravates the cellular effects of parkin suppression in midbrain neurons and glia. We observed that parkin null (PK-KO) midbrain neuronal cultures are resistant to epoxomicin-induced cell death. This resistance is due to increased GSH and DJ-1 protein levels in PK-KO mice. The treatment with epoxomicin increases, in wild type (WT) cultures, the pro-apoptotic Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, the phosphorylation of tau, and the levels of chaperones heat-shock protein 70 and C-terminal Hsc-interacting protein, but none of these effects took place in epoxomicin-treated PK-KO cultures. Poly-ubiquitinated proteins increased more in WT than in PK-KO-treated neuronal cultures. Parkin accumulated in WT neuronal cultures treated with epoxomicin. Markers of autophagy, such as LC3II/I, were increased in naïve PK-KO cultures, and further increased after treatment with epoxomicin, implying that the blockade of the proteasome in PK-KO neurons triggers the enhancement of autophagy. The treatment with l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine and the inhibition of autophagy, however, reverted the increase resistance to epoxomicin of the PK-KO cultures. We also found that PK-KO glial cells, stressed by growth in defined medium and depleted of GSH, were more susceptible to epoxomicin induced cell death than WT glia treated similarly. This susceptibility was linked to reduced GSH levels and less heat-shock protein 70 response, and to activation of p-serine/threonine kinase protein signaling pathway as well as to increased poly-ubiquitinated proteins. These data suggest that mild UPS inhibition is compensated by other mechanisms in PK-KO midbrain neurons. However the depletion of GSH, as happens in stressed glia, suppresses the protection against UPS inhibition-induced cell death. Furthermore, GSH inhibition regulated differentially UPS activity and in old PK-KO mice, which have depletion of GSH, UPS activity is decreased in comparison with that of old-WT.
