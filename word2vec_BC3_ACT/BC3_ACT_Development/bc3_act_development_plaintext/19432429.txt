Hydrazine borane: a promising hydrogen storage material.

T Hügle, MF Kühnel, D Lentz

We describe an easy method of improving the promising hydrogen storage capabilities of hydrazine borane by adding an equimolar amount of lithium hydride. The resulting mixture contains 14.8 wt % H(2). The hydrogen release behavior of both the pure hydrazine borane and the LiH mixture was studied at various temperatures and showed excellent hydrogen release rates at a reasonable temperature range of 100-150 degrees C.
