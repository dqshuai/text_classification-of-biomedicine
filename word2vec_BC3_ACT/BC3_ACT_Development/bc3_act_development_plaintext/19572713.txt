Control and characterization of cyclopentene unimolecular dissociation on Si(100) with scanning tunneling microscopy.

NL Yoder, JS Fakonas, MC Hersam

Dissociation of individual cyclopentene molecules on the Si(100) surface is induced and investigated using cryogenic ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Using a secondary feedback loop during elevated tunneling current and sample biasing conditions, the cyclopentene dissociation products are isolated and then characterized with atomic-scale spatial resolution. Using multibias STM and density functional theory, the cyclopentene dissociation products are shown to consist of a C(5)H(7) fragment and an individual H atom. The C(5)H(7) fragment contains a C=C double bond and is bound to the Si(100) surface via a single Si-C covalent bond, while the individual H atom can be induced to hop between two sites on a single silicon dimer with the STM tip. This study shows that the use of feedback control during STM-induced single molecule reactions allows transient reaction products to be captured and thus more thoroughly studied. While demonstrated here for cyclopentene on Si(100), this feedback-controlled approach can likely be applied to a wide array of chemical reactions on semiconductor surfaces.
