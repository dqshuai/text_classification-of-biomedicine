Ubiquitin degradation with its substrate, or as a monomer in a ubiquitination-independent mode, provides clues to proteasome regulation.

The mechanisms that regulate the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system's own components, although critically important, are largely unknown. Ub, a principal component of the system, must be maintained at adequate levels to support cellular homeostasis under basal and stressed conditions. It was suggested that Ub is degraded as part of the polyubiquitin chain along with its substrate. Here, we demonstrate in a direct manner that Ub is indeed degraded in a "piggyback" mechanism. Also, it has been shown that monomeric Ub can be rapidly degraded when a C-terminal tail of a minimal length is fused to it. The tail, which may represent the substrate or part of it, or a naturally occurring extended form of Ub, probably allows entry of the protein into the 20S catalytic chamber, while Ub serves as an anchor to the 19S complex. Here, we show that shorter-tailed Ubs, such as UBB(+1), bind to the proteasome but because they cannot be efficiently degraded, they inhibit the degradation of other Ub system's substrates such as Myc, p21, Mdm2, and MyoD. The inhibition depends on the ability of the tailed Ubs to be ubiquitinated: their mere binding to the proteasome is not sufficient. Interestingly, the inhibition affects only substrates that must undergo ubiquitination for their degradation: ornithine decarboxylase that is targeted by the proteasome in a Ub-independent manner, is not affected by the short-tailed ubiquitinated Ubs, suggesting it binds to the 19S complex in a site different from that to which ubiquitinated substrates bind.
