Closing in on mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis.

M Rauzi, T Lecuit

It remains largely unknown how large-scale tissue movements during development emerge from the interplay of different tensile forces associated with actomyosin networks. Solon et al. (2009) now report that a ratchet-like mechanism drives the movement of epithelial sheets during dorsal closure in embryos of the fruit fly Drosophila.
