MCM10 mediates RECQ4 association with MCM2-7 helicase complex during DNA replication.

Mutations in RECQ4, a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases, have been linked to the progeroid disease Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome. Attempts to understand the complex phenotypes observed in recq4-deficient cells suggest a potential involvement in DNA repair and replication, yet the molecular basis of the function of RECQ4 in these processes remains unknown. Here, we report the identification of a highly purified chromatin-bound RECQ4 complex from human cell extracts. We found that essential replisome factors MCM10, MCM2-7 helicase, CDC45 and GINS are the primary interaction partner proteins of human RECQ4. Importantly, complex formation and the association of RECQ4 with the replication origin are cell-cycle regulated. Furthermore, we show that MCM10 is essential for the integrity of the RECQ4-MCM replicative helicase complex. MCM10 interacts directly with RECQ4 and regulates its DNA unwinding activity, and that this interaction may be modulated by cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation. Thus, these studies show that RECQ4 is an integral component of the MCM replicative helicase complex participating in DNA replication in human cells.
