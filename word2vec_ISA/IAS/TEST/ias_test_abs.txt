Induction of apoptosis by p110C requires mitochondrial translocation of
the proapoptotic BCL-2 family member BAD.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
p110C, a 50-kDa isoform of the PITSLRE kinase family, was demonstrated to play an important role in cell apoptosis. However, how p110C exactly promotes apoptosis is unclear. Our previous study showed that p110C interacted with p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), an important kinase of the proapoptotic BCL-2 family member BAD, and evidently inhibited its kinase activity. Here, we report that overexpression of p110C leads to decreased phosphorylation of BAD and its subsequent translocation from cytosol to mitochondria, which in turn induces the release of cytochrome c and the onset of apoptosis. Knocking down endogenous BAD expression will inhibit p110C induced apoptosis. Two kinase dead forms of p110C, D149N and K36N, lose the ability to inhibit the kinase activity of PAK1 and fail to induce the translocation of BAD and the BAD and such proapoptotic ability is associated with the kinase activity of p110C.

Retinoic-acid signalling in node ectoderm and posterior neural plate
directs left-right patterning of somitic mesoderm.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Somitogenesis requires bilateral rhythmic segmentation of paraxial mesoderm along the antero-posterior axis. The location of somite segmentation depends on opposing signalling gradients of retinoic acid (generated by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2; Raldh2) anteriorly and fibroblast growth factor (FGF; generated by Fgf8) posteriorly. Retinoic-acid-deficient embryos exhibit somite left-right asymmetry, but it remains unclear how retinoic acid mediates left-right patterning. Here, we demonstrate that retinoic-acid signalling is uniform across the left-right axis and occurs in node ectoderm but not node mesoderm. In Raldh2(-/-) mouse embryos, ectodermal Fgf8 expression encroaches anteriorly into node ectoderm and neural plate, but its expression in presomitic mesoderm is initially unchanged. The late stages of somitogenesis were rescued in Raldh2(-/-) mouse embryos when the maternal diet was supplemented with retinoic acid until only the 6-somite stage, demonstrating that retinoic acid is only needed during node stages. A retinoic-acid-reporter transgene marking the action of maternal retinoic acid in rescued Raldh2(-/-) embryos revealed that the targets of retinoic-acid signalling during somitogenesis are the node ectoderm and the posterior neural plate, not the presomitic mesoderm. Our findings suggest that antagonism of Fgf8 expression by retinoic acid occurs in the ectoderm and that failure of this mechanism generates excessive FGF8 signalling to adjacent mesoderm, resulting initially in smaller somites and then left-right asymmetry.

Topoisomerase II, not topoisomerase I, is the proficient relaxase of
nucleosomal DNA.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Eukaryotic topoisomerases I and II efficiently remove helical tension in naked DNA molecules. However, this activity has not been examined in nucleosomal DNA, their natural substrate. Here, we obtained yeast minichromosomes holding DNA under (+) helical tension, and incubated them with topoisomerases. We show that DNA supercoiling density can rise above +0.04 without displacement of the histones and that the typical nucleosome topology is restored upon DNA relaxation. However, in contrast to what is observed in naked DNA, topoisomerase II relaxes nucleosomal DNA much faster than topoisomerase I. The same effect occurs in cell extracts containing physiological dosages of topoisomeraseI and II. Apparently, the DNA strand-rotation mechanism of topoisomerase I does not efficiently relax chromatin, which imposes barriers for DNA twist diffusion. Conversely, the DNA cross-inversion mechanism of topoisomerase II is facilitated in chromatin, which favor the juxtaposition of DNA segments. We conclude that topoisomerase II is the main modulator of DNA topology in chromatin fibers. The nonessential topoisomerase I then assists DNA relaxation where chromatin structure impairs DNA juxtaposition but allows twist diffusion.

Estrogen-related receptor alpha is a repressor of phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase gene transcription.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor (ERR) alpha is a downstream effector of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha in the regulation of genes important for mitochondrial oxidative capacity. PGC-1alpha is also a potent activator of the transcriptional program required for hepatic gluconeogenesis, and in particular of the key gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). We report here that the regulatory sequences of the PEPCK gene harbor a functional ERRalpha binding site. However, in contrast to the co-stimulating effects of ERRalpha and PGC-1alpha on mitochondrial gene expression, ERRalpha acts as a transcriptional repressor of the PEPCK gene. Suppression of ERRalpha expression by small interfering RNA leads to reduced binding of ERRalpha to the endogenous PEPCK gene, and an increase in promoter occupancy by PGC-1alpha, suggesting that part of the ERRalpha function at this gene is to antagonize the action of PGC-1alpha. In agreement with the in vitro studies, animals that lack ERRalpha show increased expression of gluconeogenic genes, including PEPCK and glycerol kinase, but decreased expression of mitochondrial genes, such as ATP synthase subunit beta and cytochrome c-1. Our findings suggest that ERRalpha has opposing effects on genes important for mitochondrial oxidative capacity and gluconeogenesis. The different functions of ERRalpha in the regulation of these pathways suggest that enhancing ERRalpha activity could have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism in diabetic subjects by two distinct mechanisms: increasing mitochondrial oxidative capacity in peripheral tissues and liver, and suppressing hepatic glucose production.

The role of seladin-1/DHCR24 in cholesterol biosynthesis, APP processing
and Abeta generation in vivo.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The cholesterol-synthesizing enzyme seladin-1, encoded by the Dhcr24 gene, is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent oxidoreductase and regulates responses to oncogenic and oxidative stimuli. It has a role in neuroprotection and is downregulated in affected neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show that seladin-1-deficient mouse brains had reduced levels of cholesterol and disorganized cholesterol-rich detergent-resistant membrane domains (DRMs). This was associated with inefficient plasminogen binding and plasmin activation, the displacement of beta-secretase (BACE) from DRMs to APP-containing membrane fractions, increased beta-cleavage of APP and high levels of Abeta peptides. In contrast, overexpression of seladin-1 increased both cholesterol and the recruitment of DRM components into DRM fractions, induced plasmin activation and reduced both BACE processing of APP and Abeta formation. These results establish a role of seladin-1 in the formation of DRMs and suggest that seladin-1-dependent cholesterol synthesis is involved in lowering Abeta levels. Pharmacological enhancement of seladin-1 activity may be a novel Abeta-lowering approach for the treatment of AD.

Identification of MEKK2/3 serine phosphorylation site targeted by the
Toll-like receptor and stress pathways.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family are crucial for the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and cellular stress responses. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the TLR- and cellular stress-mediated MAP3K activation remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified a key regulatory phosphorylation site, serine 519 and serine 526, in MAP3K MEKK2 and MEKK3, respectively. Mutation of this serine to an alanine severely impaired MEKK2/3 activation. We generated an anti-p-MEKK2/3 antibody and used this antibody to demonstrate that lipopolysaccharide induced MEKK2 and MEKK3 phosphorylation on their regulatory serine. We found that the serine phosphorylation was crucial for TLR-induced interleukin 6 production and this process is regulated by TRAF6, a key adaptor molecule for the TLR pathway. We further demonstrated that many, but not all, MAPK agonists induced the regulatory serine phosphorylation, suggesting an involvement of different MAP3Ks in activation of the MAPK cascades leading to different cellular responses. In conclusion, this study reveals a novel molecular mechanism for MEKK2/3 activation by the TLR and cellular stress pathways.

Domain architecture of protein-disulfide isomerase facilitates its dual
role as an oxidase and an isomerase in Ero1p-mediated disulfide formation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Native disulfide bond formation in eukaryotes is dependent on protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and its homologs, which contain varying combinations of catalytically active and inactive thioredoxin domains. However, the specific contribution of PDI to the formation of new disulfides versus reduction/rearrangement of non-native disulfides is poorly understood. We analyzed the role of individual PDI domains in disulfide bond formation in a reaction driven by their natural oxidant, Ero1p. We found that Ero1p oxidizes the isolated PDI catalytic thioredoxin domains, A and A' at the same rate. In contrast, we found that in the context of full-length PDI, there is an asymmetry in the rate of oxidation of the two active sites. This asymmetry is the result of a dual effect: an enhanced rate of oxidation of the second catalytic (A') domain and the substrate-mediated inhibition of oxidation of the first catalytic (A) domain. The specific order of thioredoxin domains in PDI is important in establishing the asymmetry in the rate of oxidation of the two active sites thus allowing A and A', two thioredoxin domains that are similar in sequence and structure, to serve opposing functional roles as a disulfide isomerase and disulfide oxidase, respectively. These findings reveal how native disulfide folding is accomplished in the endoplasmic reticulum and provide a context for understanding the proliferation of PDI homologs with combinatorial arrangements of thioredoxin domains.

<ABSTRACT>
Target selection and ranking is fundamental to structural genomics. We present a Z-score scale, the "OB-Score", to rank potential targets by their predicted propensity to produce diffraction-quality crystals. The OB-Score is derived from a matrix of predicted isoelectric point and hydrophobicity values for nonredundant PDB entries solved to <or=3.0 A against a background of UniRef50. A highly significant difference was found between the OB-Scores for TargetDB test datasets. A wide range of OB-Scores was observed across 241 proteomes and within 7868 PfamA families; 73.4% of PfamA families contain >or=1 member with a high OB-Score, presenting favourable candidates for structural studies.

Ubiquitylation of leptin receptor OB-Ra regulates its clathrin-mediated
endocytosis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Leptin receptors are constitutively endocytosed in a ligand-independent manner. To study their endocytosis, leptin receptors OB-Ra and OB-Rb were expressed in HeLa cells. Both receptor isoforms were ubiquitylated, internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and transported to Hrs-positive endosomes after their internalization. Proteasome inhibitors inhibited OB-Ra but not OB-Rb internalization from the cell surface. OB-Ra ubiquitylation occurred on lysine residues K877 and K889 in the cytoplasmic tail, the mutation of which abolished OB-Ra internalization. Fusion of an ubiquitin molecule at the C-terminus of an OB-Ra construct defective both in ubiquitylation and endocytosis restored clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the receptor. The internalization of this constitutively mono-ubiquitylated construct was no longer sensitive to proteasome inhibitors, which inhibited OB-Ra endocytosis by blocking its ubiquitylation. Fusion of an ubiquitin molecule to a transferrin receptor deleted from its own endocytosis motif restored clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We propose that mono-ubiquitin conjugates act as internalization motifs for clathrin-dependent endocytosis of leptin receptor OB-Ra.

Structural insights into substrate traffic and inhibition in
acetylcholinesterase.

<ABSTRACT>
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) terminates nerve-impulse transmission at cholinergic synapses by rapid hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Substrate traffic in AChE involves at least two binding sites, the catalytic and peripheral anionic sites, which have been suggested to be allosterically related and involved in substrate inhibition. Here, we present the crystal structures of Torpedo californica AChE complexed with the substrate acetylthiocholine, the product thiocholine and a nonhydrolysable substrate analogue. These structures provide a series of static snapshots of the substrate en route to the active site and identify, for the first time, binding of substrate and product at both the peripheral and active sites. Furthermore, they provide structural insight into substrate inhibition in AChE at two different substrate concentrations. Our structural data indicate that substrate inhibition at moderate substrate concentration is due to choline exit being hindered by a substrate molecule bound at the peripheral site. At the higher concentration, substrate inhibition arises from prevention of exit of acetate due to binding of two substrate molecules within the active-site gorge.

Oxygen binding and NO scavenging properties of truncated hemoglobin, HbN,
of Mycobacterium smegmatis.

<ABSTRACT>
Unraveling of microbial genome data has indicated that two distantly related truncated hemoglobins (trHbs), HbN and HbO, might occur in many species of slow-growing pathogenic mycobacteria. Involvement of HbN in bacterial defense against NO toxicity and nitrosative stress has been proposed. A gene, encoding a putative HbN homolog with conserved features of typical trHbs, has been identified within the genome sequence of fast-growing mycobacterium, Mycobacterium smegmatis. Sequence analysis of M. smegmatis HbN indicated that it is relatively smaller in size and lacks N-terminal pre-A region, carrying 12-residue polar sequence motif that is present in HbN of M. tuberculosis. HbN encoding gene of M. smegmatis was expressed in E. coli as a 12.8kD homodimeric heme protein that binds oxygen reversibly with high affinity (P50 approximately 0.081 mm Hg) and autooxidizes faster than M. tuberculosis HbN. The circular dichroism spectra indicate that HbN of M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis are structurally similar. Interestingly, an hmp mutant of E. coli, unable to metabolize nitric oxide, exhibited very low NO uptake activity in the presence of M. smegmatis HbN as compared to HbN of M. tuberculosis. On the basis of cellular heme content, specific nitric oxide dioxygenase (NOD) activity of M. smegmatis HbN was nearly one-third of that from M. tuberculosis. Additionally, the hmp mutant of E. coli, carrying M. smegmatis HbN, exhibited nearly 10-fold lower cell survival under nitrosative stress and nitrite derived reactive nitrogen species as compared to the isogenic strain harboring HbN of M. tuberculosis. Taken together, these results suggest that NO metabolizing activity and protection provided by M. smegmatis HbN against toxicity of NO and reactive nitrogen is significantly lower than HbN of M. tuberculosis. The lower efficiency of M. smegmatis HbN for NO detoxification as compared to M. tuberculosis HbN might be related to different level of NO exposure and nitrosative stress faced by these mycobacteria during their cellular metabolism.

<ABSTRACT>
Fluorescence techniques can provide insight into the environment of fluorescence indicators situated at distinct sites within a ligand as it is bound to its receptor. Here, we have developed a series of analogues of the 27-amino acid hormone, secretin, that incorporate a fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 into the amino terminus, the carboxyl terminus, and positions 13 and 22. Each probe bound with high affinity and was biologically active, stimulating full cAMP responses in receptor-bearing Chinese hamster ovary-SecR cells. Treatment with 10 mum guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate (GppNHp) shifted the agonist-bound receptor into a G protein-uncoupled low affinity state. Fluorescence spectra for the probes in solution and bound to the receptor demonstrated maximal emission at 521 nm after excitation at 481 nm. Collisional quenching of fluorescence with potassium iodide revealed that Alexa at the amino terminus of secretin was more accessible than at the other three positions within the probes. Of note, quenching constants for each probe were higher when bound in the active state than in the G protein-uncoupled, low affinity state of the receptor, with the most marked changes occurring for the two midregion probes. Anisotropy values and fluorescence lifetimes confirmed this, with higher anisotropy and longer lifetimes observed for position 13 and 22 probes bound to the receptor in its uncoupled state than in its active state. These observations suggest that the amino terminus of secretin as docked to the receptor is most exposed to the hydrophilic aqueous milieu, and that the major changes in conformation and exposure to the medium occur in the midregion of secretin. Photoaffinity labeling studies have demonstrated approximation of each of these ligand residues with distinct receptor residues. Combining the fluorescence data with photoaffinity labeling data provides insights into the conformation and dynamics of a natural peptide ligand docked to a Family B G protein-coupled receptor.

<ABSTRACT>
Elongation factor (EF-) Tu.GTP is the carrier of aminoacyl-tRNA to the programmed ribosome. Enacyloxin IIa inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by hindering the release of EF-Tu.GDP from the ribosome. The crystal structure of the Escherichia coli EF-Tu.guanylyl iminodiphosphate (GDPNP).enacyloxin IIa complex at 2.3 A resolution presented here reveals the location of the antibiotic at the interface of domains 1 and 3. The binding site overlaps that of kirromycin, an antibiotic with a structure that is unrelated to enacyloxin IIa but that also inhibits EF-Tu.GDP release. As one of the major differences, the enacyloxin IIa tail borders a hydrophobic pocket that is occupied by the longer tail of kirromycin, explaining the higher binding affinity of the latter. EF-Tu.GDPNP.enacyloxin IIa shows a disordered effector region that in the Phe-tRNAPhe.EF-Tu (Thermus aquaticus).GDPNP.enacyloxin IIa complex, solved at 3.1 A resolution, is stabilized by the interaction with tRNA. This work clarifies the structural background of the action of enacyloxin IIa and compares its properties with those of kirromycin, opening new perspectives for structure-guided design of novel antibiotics.

A unique set of SH3-SH3 interactions controls IB1 homodimerization.

<ABSTRACT>
Islet-brain 1 (IB1 or JIP-1) is a scaffold protein that interacts with components of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal-transduction pathway. IB1 is expressed at high levels in neurons and in pancreatic beta-cells, where it controls expression of several insulin-secretory components and secretion. IB1 has been shown to homodimerize, but neither the molecular mechanisms nor the function of dimerization have yet been characterized. Here, we show that IB1 homodimerizes through a novel and unique set of Src homology 3 (SH3)-SH3 interactions. X-ray crystallography studies show that the dimer interface covers a region usually engaged in PxxP-mediated ligand recognition, even though the IB1 SH3 domain lacks this motif. The highly stable IB1 homodimer can be significantly destabilized in vitro by three individual point mutations directed against key residues involved in dimerization. Each mutation reduces IB1-dependent basal JNK activity in 293T cells. Impaired dimerization also results in a reduction in glucose transporter type 2 expression and in glucose-dependent insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. Taken together, these results indicate that IB1 homodimerization through its SH3 domain has pleiotropic effects including regulation of the insulin secretion process.

Induction of apoptosis by the Ste20-like kinase SLK, a germinal center

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Expression and activity of the germinal center kinase, Ste20-like kinase (SLK), are increased during kidney development and recovery from ischemic acute renal failure. In this study, we characterize the activation and functional role of SLK. SLK underwent dimerization via the C-terminal domain, and dimerization enhanced SLK activity. In contrast, the C-terminal domain of SLK did not dimerize with a related kinase, Mst1, and did not affect Mst1 activity. Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of SLK were not associated with changes in kinase activity. SLK induced phosphorylation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) and increased ASK1 activity, indicating that ASK1 is a substrate of SLK. Moreover, SLK stimulated phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase via ASK1, but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase nor extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Chemical anoxia and recovery during re-exposure to glucose (ischemia-reperfusion injury in cell culture) stimulated SLK activity. Overexpression of SLK enhanced anoxia/recovery-induced apoptosis, release of cytochrome c, and activities of caspase-8 and -9, and apoptosis was reduced significantly with p38 and caspase-9 inhibitors. Induction of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response by anoxia/recovery or tunicamycin (monitored by induction of Bip or Grp94 expression, phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha subunit, expression of CHOP, and activation of caspase-12) was attenuated in cells that overexpress SLK. Thus, SLK is an anoxia/recovery-dependent kinase that is activated via homodimerization and that signals via ASK1 and p38 to promote apoptosis. Attenuation of the protective aspects of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response by SLK may contribute to its proapoptotic effect.

<ABSTRACT>
Gsl5 regulates the expression of a glycolipid and glycoproteins that contain the Le(X) epitope in the mouse kidney through tissue-specific transcriptional regulation of the core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (core 2 GnT) gene. The core 2 GnT gene has six exons and produces three alternatively spliced transcripts. Gsl5 regulates only the expression of the kidney-type mRNA, which is transcribed from the most 5'-upstream exon. By introducing a 159-kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone that carries the mouse core 2 GnT gene and its 5'-upstream region into DBA/2 mice that carry a defective Gsl5 allele, we were able to rescue the deficient phenotype. The BAC clone was subsequently engineered to replace the core 2 GnT gene with the sequence of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a reporter by an inducible homologous recombination system in Escherichia coli. The transgenic mice derived from the modified BAC clone expressed EGFP in the kidney, which suggests that the candidate Gsl5 is in the 5'-upstream region of the core 2 GnT gene. Sequence analysis of the 5'-upstream regions of the BAC clone and DBA/2 genomic DNA revealed a candidate sequence for Gsl5 at about 5.5 kb upstream of exon 1. This sequence consisted of eight repeats of two GT-rich units in the wild-type mice, whereas it consisted of only one pair of GT-rich units with a minor modification in the DBA/2 mice. Transgenic mice produced with the EGFP reporter gene construct that included this candidate sequence expressed EGFP exclusively in the proximal straight tubular cells of the kidney. These results indicated that this unique repeat is indeed the Gsl5, and it is a cis-regulatory element responsible for proximal straight tubule cell-specific transcriptional regulation.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Tpl2/Cot is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a key physiological role in the regulation of immune responses to pro-inflammatory stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha stimulates the JNK, ERK, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and the NF-kappaB pathway by recruiting RIP1 and TRAF2 to the TNF receptor 1. Here we showed that Tpl2 activation by TNF-alpha signals depends on the integrity of the Tpl2-interacting proteins RIP1 and TRAF2, which are required for the engagement of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. However, neither RIP1 nor TRAF2 overexpression was sufficient to activate Tpl2 and ERK. We also showed that Tpl2 activation by TNF-alpha depends on a tyrosine kinase activity that is detected in TNF-alpha-stimulated cells. Based on both genetic and biochemical evidence, we concluded that in a variety of cell types, Syk is the tyrosine kinase that plays an important role in the activation of Tpl2 upstream of ERK. These data therefore dissect the TNF receptor 1 proximal events that regulate Tpl2 and ERK and highlight a role for RIP1, TRAF2, and Syk in this pathway.

<ABSTRACT>
Helicases unwind dsDNA during replication, repair and recombination in an ATP-dependent reaction. The mechanism for helicase activity can be studied using oligonucleotide substrates to measure formation of single-stranded (ss) DNA from double-stranded (ds) DNA. This assay provides an 'all-or-nothing' readout because partially unwound intermediates are not detected. We have determined conditions under which an intermediate in the reaction cycle of Dda helicase can be detected by trapping a partially unwound substrate. The appearance of this intermediate supports a model in which each ssDNA product interacts with the helicase after unwinding has occurred. Kinetic analysis indicates that the intermediate appears during a slow step in the reaction cycle that is flanked by faster steps for unwinding. These observations demonstrate a complex mechanism containing nonuniform steps for a monomeric helicase. The potential biological significance of such a mechanism is discussed.

Dual role of MutS glutamate 38 in DNA mismatch discrimination and in the
authorization of repair.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
MutS plays a critical role in DNA mismatch repair in Escherichia coli by binding to mismatches and initiating repair in an ATP-dependent manner. Mutational analysis of a highly conserved glutamate, Glu38, has revealed its role in mismatch recognition by enabling MutS to discriminate between homoduplex and mismatched DNA. Crystal structures of MutS have shown that Glu38 forms a hydrogen bond to one of the mismatched bases. In this study, we have analyzed the crystal structures, DNA binding and the response to ATP binding of three Glu38 mutants. While confirming the role of the negative charge in initial discrimination, we show that in vivo mismatch repair can proceed even when discrimination is low. We demonstrate that the formation of a hydrogen bond by residue 38 to the mismatched base authorizes repair by inducing intramolecular signaling, which results in the inhibition of rapid hydrolysis of distally bound ATP. This allows formation of the stable MutS-ATP-DNA clamp, a key intermediate in triggering downstream repair events.

<ABSTRACT>
The plant homodomain (PHD) of ING2 was shown to regulate p53-dependent apoptosis through phosphoinositides signaling. However, the role of a predicted leucine zipper-like (LZL) motif in N-terminus of ING2 is unclear. Here, we show that LZL motif is critical for the proper functions of ING2 in DNA repair, apoptosis and chromatin remodeling after UV irradiation. Deletion of LZL domain also abrogated the association between ING2 and p53, but not between ING2 and p300, suggesting that ING2 modulates p53-dependent chromatin remodeling, apoptosis and DNA repair by functioning as a scaffold protein to mediate the interaction between p53 and p300.

Nucleotide exchange via local protein unfolding--structure of Rab8 in
complex with MSS4.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Rab GTPases function as essential regulators of vesicle transport in eukaryotic cells. MSS4 was shown to stimulate nucleotide exchange on Rab proteins associated with the exocytic pathway and to have nucleotide-free-Rab chaperone activity. A detailed kinetic analysis of MSS4 interaction with Rab8 showed that MSS4 is a relatively slow exchange factor that forms a long-lived nucleotide-free complex with RabGTPase. In contrast to other characterized exchange factor-GTPase complexes, MSS4:Rab8 complex binds GTP faster than GDP, but still ca. 3 orders of magnitude more slowly than comparable complexes. The crystal structure of the nucleotide-free MSS4:Rab8 complex revealed that MSS4 binds to the Switch I and interswitch regions of Rab8, forming an intermolecular beta-sheet. Complex formation results in dramatic structural changes of the Rab8 molecule, leading to unfolding of the nucleotide-binding site and surrounding structural elements, facilitating nucleotide release and slowing its rebinding. Coupling of nucleotide exchange activity to a cycle of GTPase unfolding and refolding represents a novel nucleotide exchange mechanism.

The synaptic vesicle protein 2C mediates the uptake of botulinum
neurotoxin A into phrenic nerves.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) inhibit neurotransmitter release by selectively cleaving core components of the vesicular fusion machinery. The synaptic vesicle proteins Synaptotagmin-I and -II act as receptors for BoNT/B and BoNT/G. Here we show that BoNT/A also interacts with a synaptic vesicle protein, the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C (SV2C), but not with the homologous proteins SV2A and SV2B. Binding of BoNT/A occurs at the membrane juxtaposed region preceding transmembrane domain 8. A peptide comprising the intravesicular domain between transmembrane domains 7 and 8 specifically reduces the neurotoxicity of BoNT/A at phrenic nerve preparations demonstrating the physiological relevance of this interaction.

Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A transpeptidase. Calcium promotes sorting
signal binding by altering the mobility and structure of an active site

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Many virulence factors in gram-positive bacteria are covalently anchored to the cell-wall peptidoglycan by sortase enzymes, a group of widely distributed cysteine transpeptidases. The Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A protein (SrtA) is the archetypal member of the Sortase family and is activated by Ca2+, an adaptation that may facilitate host colonization as elevated concentrations of this ion are encountered in human tissue. Here we show that a single Ca2+ ion bound to an ordered pocket on SrtA allosterically activates catalysis by modulating both the structure and dynamics of a large active site loop. Detailed nitrogen-15 relaxation measurements indicate that Ca2+ may facilitate the adaptive recognition of the substrate by inducing slow micro- to millisecond time-scale dynamics in the active site. Interestingly, relaxation compensated Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill experiments suggest that the time scale of these motions is directly correlated with ion binding. The results of site-directed mutagenesis indicate that this motional coupling is mediated by the side chain of Glu-171, which is positioned within the beta6/beta7 loop and shown to contribute to Ca2+ binding. The available structural and dynamics data are compatible with a loop closure model of Ca2+ activation, in which the beta6/beta7 loop fluctuates between a binding competent closed form that is stabilized by Ca2+, and an open, highly flexible state that removes key substrate contacting residues from the active site.

Characterization of an aldolase-binding site in the Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome protein.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) is an essential transmembrane molecule in Plasmodium sporozoites. TRAP displays adhesive motifs on the extracellular portion, whereas its cytoplasmic tail connects to actin via aldolase, thus driving parasite motility and host cell invasion. The minimal requirements for the TRAP binding to aldolase were scanned here and found to be shared by different human proteins, including the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) family members. In vitro and in vivo binding of WASp members to aldolase was characterized by biochemical, deletion mapping, mutagenesis, and co-immunoprecipitation studies. As in the case of TRAP, the binding of WASp to aldolase is competitively inhibited by the enzyme substrate/products. Furthermore, TRAP and WASp, but not other unrelated aldolase binders, compete for the binding to the enzyme in vitro. Together, our results define a conserved aldolase binding motif in the WASp family members and suggest that aldolase modulates the motility and actin dynamics of mammalian cells. These findings along with the presence of similar aldolase binding motifs in additional human proteins, some of which indeed interact with aldolase in pull-down assays, suggest supplementary, non-glycolytic roles for this enzyme.

FliI and FliH from Helicobacter pylori.

<ABSTRACT>
Bacterial flagellar protein export requires an ATPase, FliI, and presumptive inhibitor, FliH. We have explored the molecular basis for FliI/FliH interaction in the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. By using bioinformatic and biochemical analyses, we showed that residues 1-18 of FliI very likely form an amphipathic alpha-helix upon interaction with FliH, and that residues 21-91 of FliI resemble the N-terminal oligomerization domain of the F1-ATPase catalytic subunits. A truncated FliI-(2-91) protein was shown to be folded, although the N-terminal 18 residues were likely unstructured. Deletion and scanning mutagenesis showed that residues 1-18 of FliI were essential for the FliI/FliH interaction. Scanning mutation of amino acids in the N-terminal 10 residues of FliI indicated that a cluster of hydrophobic residues in this segment was critical for the interaction with FliH. The interaction between FliI and FliH has similarities to the interaction between the N-terminal alpha-helix of the F1-ATPase alpha-subunit and the globular domain of the F1-ATPase delta-subunit, respectively. This similarity suggests that FliH may function as a molecular stator.

Involvement of myosin Vb in glutamate receptor trafficking.

<ABSTRACT>
Myosin V motors mediate cargo transport; however, the identity of neuronal molecules transported by these proteins remains unknown. Here we show that myosin Vb is expressed in several neuronal populations and associates with the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate-type glutamate receptor subunit GluR1. In developing hippocampal neurons, expression of the tail domain of myosin Vb, but not myosin Va, enhanced GluR1 accumulation in the soma and reduced its surface expression. These changes were accompanied by reduced GluR1 clustering and diminished frequency of excitatory but not inhibitory synaptic currents. Similar effects were observed upon expression of full-length myosin Vb lacking a C-terminal region required for binding to the small GTPase Rab11. In contrast, mutant myosin Vb did not change the localization of several other neurotransmitter receptors, including the glutamate receptor subunit NR1. These results reveal a novel mechanism for the transport of a specific glutamate receptor subunit in neurons mediated by a member of the myosin V family.

Metazoans rapidly respond to changes in oxygen availability by regulating gene expression. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible-factor (HIF), which controls the expression of several genes, 'senses' the oxygen concentration indirectly through the hydroxylation of two proline residues that earmarks the HIF-alpha subunits for proteasomal degradation. We review the expression, regulation and function of the HIF prolyl hydroxylases or prolyl hydroxylases domain proteins, which are genuine oxygen sensors.

<ABSTRACT>
We describe inhibition of HIV replication by a partially double-stranded 54mer oligodeoxynucleotide, ODN, which consists of an antisense strand targeting the highly conserved polypurine tract, PPT, of HIV, and a second strand, compatible with triple-helix formation. Upon treatment of HIV-infected cells with ODN early after infection no viral nucleic acids, syncytia or p24 viral antigen expression was observed. The ODN-mediated effect was highly sequence-specific. The ODN against HIV-IIIB was effective preferentially against its homologous PPT and less against the PPT of HIV-BaL differing in two of 24 nucleotides and vice versa. It may be interesting mechanistically as an antiviral drug.

Stable association of 70-kDa heat shock protein induces latent multisite

<ABSTRACT>
The multisite-specific endonuclease Endo.SceI of yeast mitochondria is unique among endonucleases because its 50-kDa subunit forms a stable dimer with the mitochondrial 70-kDa heat shock protein (mtHSP70), which otherwise fulfills a chaperone function by binding transiently to unfolded proteins. Here we show that the mtHSP70 subunit confers broader sequence specificity, greater stability, and higher activity on the 50-kDa subunit. The 50-kDa subunit alone displayed weaker activity and highly sequence-specific endonuclease activity. The 50-kDa protein exists as a heterodimer with mtHSP70 in vivo, allowing Endo.SceI to cleave specifically at multiple sites on mitochondrial DNA. Endo.SceI may have evolved from a highly specific endonuclease that gained broader sequence specificity after becoming a stable partner of mtHSP70.

<ABSTRACT>
The intermingling of larval functional neurons with adult-specific neurons during metamorphosis contributes to the development of the adult Drosophila brain. To better understand this process, we characterized the development of a dorsal cluster (DC) of Atonal-positive neurons that are born at early larval stages but do not undergo extensive morphogenesis until pupal formation. We found that Baboon(Babo)/dSmad2-mediated TGF-beta signaling, known to be essential for remodeling of larval functional neurons, is also indispensable for proper morphogenesis of these adult-specific neurons. Mosaic analysis reveals slowed development of mutant DC neurons, as evidenced by delays in both neuronal morphogenesis and atonal expression. We observe similar phenomena in other adult-specific neurons. We further demonstrate that Babo/dSmad2 operates autonomously in individual neurons and specifically during the late larval stage. Our results suggest that Babo/dSmad2 signaling prior to metamorphosis may be widely required to prepare neurons for the dynamic environment present during metamorphosis.

the second step of N-linked glycosylation.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
N-linked glycosylation requires the synthesis of an evolutionarily conserved lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor that is essential for glycoprotein folding and stability. Despite intense research, several of the enzymes required for LLO synthesis have not yet been identified. Here we show that two poorly characterized yeast proteins known to be required for the synthesis of the LLO precursor, GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol, interact to form an unusual hetero-oligomeric UDP-GlcNAc transferase. Alg13 contains a predicted catalytic domain, but lacks any membrane-spanning domains. Alg14 spans the membrane but lacks any sequences predicted to play a direct role in sugar catalysis. We show that Alg14 functions as a membrane anchor that recruits Alg13 to the cytosolic face of the ER, where catalysis of GlcNAc2-PP-dol occurs. Alg13 and Alg14 physically interact and under normal conditions, are associated with the ER membrane. Overexpression of Alg13 leads to its cytosolic partitioning, as does reduction of Alg14 levels. Concomitant Alg14 overproduction suppresses this cytosolic partitioning of Alg13, demonstrating that Alg14 is both necessary and sufficient for the ER localization of Alg13. Further evidence for the functional relevance of this interaction comes from our demonstration that the human ALG13 and ALG14 orthologues fail to pair with their yeast partners, but when co-expressed in yeast can functionally complement the loss of either ALG13 or ALG14. These results demonstrate that this novel UDP-GlcNAc transferase is a unique eukaryotic ER glycosyltransferase that is comprised of at least two functional polypeptides, one that functions in catalysis and the other as a membrane anchor.

<ABSTRACT>
Wybutosine (yW) is a tricyclic nucleoside with a large side chain found at the 3'-position adjacent to the anticodon of eukaryotic phenylalanine tRNA. yW supports codon recognition by stabilizing codon-anticodon interactions during decoding on the ribosome. To identify genes responsible for yW synthesis from uncharacterized genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we employed a systematic reverse genetic approach combined with mass spectrometry ('ribonucleome analysis'). Four genes YPL207w, YML005w, YGL050w and YOL141w (named TYW1, TYW2, TYW3 and TYW4, respectively) were essential for yW synthesis. Mass spectrometric analysis of each modification intermediate of yW revealed its sequential biosynthetic pathway. TYW1 is an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster protein responsible for the tricyclic formation. Multistep enzymatic formation of yW from yW-187 could be reconstituted in vitro using recombinant TYW2, TYW3 and TYW4 with S-adenosylmethionine, suggesting that yW synthesis might proceed through sequential reactions in a complex formed by multiple components assembled with the precursor tRNA. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that plant ortholog is a large fusion protein consisting of TYW2 and TYW3 with the C-terminal domain of TYW4.

<ABSTRACT>
The reduction kinetics of the mutants K354M and D124N of the Paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome oxidase (heme aa(3)) by ruthenium hexamine was investigated by stopped-flow spectrophotometry in the absence/presence of NO. Quick heme a reduction precedes the biphasic heme a(3) reduction, which is extremely slow in the K354M mutant (k(1) = 0.09 +/- 0.01 s(-1); k(2) = 0.005 +/- 0.001 s(-1)) but much faster in the D124N aa(3) (k(1) = 21 +/- 6 s(-1); k(2) = 2.2 +/- 0.5 s(-1)). NO causes a very large increase (>100-fold) in the rate constant of heme a(3) reduction in the K354M mutant but only a approximately 5-fold increase in the D124N mutant. The K354M enzyme reacts rapidly with O(2) when fully reduced but is essentially inactive in turnover; thus, it was proposed that impaired reduction of the active site is the cause of activity loss. Since at saturating [NO], heme a(3) reduction is approximately 100-fold faster than the extremely low turnover rate, we conclude that, contrary to O(2), NO can react not only with the two-electron but also with the single-electron reduced active site. This mechanism would account for the efficient inhibition of cytochrome oxidase activity by NO in the wild-type enzyme, both from P. denitrificans and from beef heart. Results also suggest that the H(+)-conducting K pathway, but not the D pathway, controls the kinetics of the single-electron reduction of the active site.

<ABSTRACT>
The blue-light sensitive protein YtvA from Bacillus subtilis is built of a photoactive, flavin-binding LOV (Light, Oxygen and Voltage) domain and a STAS domain with unknown function. Here we show that YtvA binds a fluorescent derivative of guanosine triphosphate (GTPTR) that can be displaced by both GTP or ATP. Unspecific NTP (N=G or A) binding is supported by the molecular model of YtvA-STAS. Blue-light activation of YtvA results in small and dark-reversible spectroscopic changes for GTPTR, suggesting that light-driven conformational changes are transmitted from the LOV core to the GTPTR binding site. These results support the idea that STAS domains may have a general NTP binding role and open a way to investigate the molecular functionality of YtvA-STAS.

Chromatin remodeling by ISW2 and SWI/SNF requires DNA translocation inside

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Chromatin-remodeling complexes regulate access to nucleosomal DNA by mobilizing nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner. In this study, we find that chromatin remodeling by SWI/SNF and ISW2 involves DNA translocation inside nucleosomes two helical turns from the dyad axis at superhelical location-2. DNA translocation at this internal position does not require the propagation of a DNA twist from the site of translocation to the entry/exit sites for nucleosome movement. Nucleosomes are moved in 9- to 11- or approximately 50-base-pair increments by ISW2 or SWI/SNF, respectively, presumably through the formation of DNA loops on the nucleosome surface. Remodeling by ISW2 but not SWI/SNF requires DNA torsional strain near the site of translocation, which may work in conjunction with conformational changes of ISW2 to promote nucleosome movement on DNA. The difference in step size of nucleosome movement by SWI/SNF and ISW2 demonstrates how SWI/SNF may be more disruptive to nucleosome structure than ISW2.

<ABSTRACT>
Group G streptococcus (GGS) is a human pathogen of emerging clinical significance. It causes skin and soft tissue infections, occasionally resulting in life-threatening conditions such as sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis. We recently identified FOG, a novel surface protein of GGS with fibrinogen binding and immune evasion properties. Here we investigated the role of FOG in streptococcal primary adhesion to host tissue. A FOG-expressing clinical isolate adhered more efficiently to human skin biopsies ex vivo and to the murine dermis in vivo than a FOG-deficient strain. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of skin specimens exhibited that this property was assigned to the ability of FOG to interact with collagen I, a major interstitial component of the dermis. Overlay experiments with human skin extracts and radiolabeled FOG followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry analysis identified both the alpha1- and alpha2-chains of collagen I as targets for FOG. Transmission electron microscopy of the molecular complexes revealed thread-like FOG molecules binding via their NH2 termini to distinct sites on collagen I monomers and fibrils. The results demonstrate that FOG is important for GGS adhesion in vivo, implying a pathogenic role for this surface protein.

A novel o-aminophenol oxidase responsible for formation of the
phenoxazinone chromophore of grixazone.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Grixazone contains a phenoxazinone chromophore and is a secondary metabolite produced by Streptomyces griseus. In the grixazone biosynthesis gene cluster, griF (encoding a tyrosinase homolog) and griE (encoding a protein similar to copper chaperons for tyrosinases) are encoded. An expression study of GriE and GriF in Escherichia coli showed that GriE activated GriF by transferring copper ions to GriF, as has been observed for a Streptomyces melanogenesis system in which the MelC1 copper chaperon transfers copper ions to MelC2 tyrosinase. In contrast with tyrosinases, GriF showed no monophenolase activity, although it oxidized various o-aminophenols as preferable substrates rather than catechol-type substrates. Deletion of the griEF locus on the chromosome resulted in accumulation of 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (3,4-AHBAL) and its acetylated compound, 3-acetylamino-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. GriF oxidized 3,4-AHBAL to yield an o-quinone imine derivative, which was then non-enzymatically coupled with another molecule of the o-quinone imine to form a phenoxazinone. The coexistence of N-acetylcysteine in the in vitro oxidation of 3,4-AH-BAL by GriF resulted in the formation of grixazone A, suggesting that the -SH group of N-acetylcysteine is conjugated to the o-quinone imine formed from 3,4-AHBAL and that the conjugate is presumably coupled with another molecule of the o-quinone imine. GriF is thus a novel o-aminophenol oxidase that is responsible for the formation of the phenoxazinone chromophore in the grixazone biosynthetic pathway.

<ABSTRACT>
Targeted deletion of two members of the FE65 family of adaptor proteins, FE65 and FE65L1, results in cortical dysplasia. Heterotopias resembling those found in cobblestone lissencephalies in which neuroepithelial cells migrate into superficial layers of the developing cortex, aberrant cortical projections and loss of infrapyramidal mossy fibers arise in FE65/FE65L1 compound null animals, but not in single gene knockouts. The disruption of pial basal membranes underlying the heterotopias and poor organization of fibrillar laminin by isolated meningeal fibroblasts from double knockouts suggests that FE65 proteins are involved in basement membrane assembly. A similar phenotype is observed in triple mutant mice lacking the APP family members APP, APLP1 and APLP2, all of which interact with FE65 proteins, suggesting that this phenotype may be caused by decreased transmission of an APP-dependent signal through the FE65 proteins. The defects observed in the double knockout may also involve the family of Ena/Vasp proteins, which participate in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and interact with the WW domains of FE65 proteins.

Cell fate-specific regulation of EGF receptor trafficking during
Caenorhabditis elegans vulval development.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
By controlling the subcellular localization of growth factor receptors, cells can modulate the activity of intracellular signal transduction pathways. During Caenorhabditis elegans vulval development, a ternary complex consisting of the LIN-7, LIN-2 and LIN-10 PDZ domain proteins localizes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to the basolateral compartment of the vulval precursor cells (VPCs) to allow efficient receptor activation by the inductive EGF signal from the anchor cell. We have identified EGFR substrate protein-8 (EPS-8) as a novel component of the EGFR localization complex that links receptor trafficking to cell fate specification. EPS-8 expression is upregulated in the primary VPCs, where it creates a positive feedback loop in the EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway. The membrane-associated guanylate kinase LIN-2 recruits EPS-8 into the receptor localization complex to retain the EGFR on the basolateral plasma membrane, and thus allow maximal receptor activation in the primary cell lineage. Low levels of EPS-8 in the neighboring secondary VPCs result in the rapid degradation of the EGFR, allowing these cells to adopt the secondary cell fate. Extracellular signals thus regulate EGFR trafficking in a cell type-specific manner to control pattern formation during organogenesis.

Camptothecin induces nuclear export of prohibitin preferentially in
transformed cells through a CRM-1-dependent mechanism.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Prohibitin is a growth-suppressive protein that has multiple functions in the nucleus and the mitochondria. Our earlier studies had shown that prohibitin represses the activity of E2F transcription factors while enhancing p53-mediated transcription. At the same time, prohibitin has been implicated in mediating the proper folding of mitochondrial proteins. We had found that treatment of cells with camptothecin, a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, led to the export of prohibitin and p53 from the nucleus to the mitochondria. Here we show that the camptothecin-induced export of prohibitin occurs preferentially in transformed cell lines, but not in untransformed or primary cells. Cells that did not display the translocation of prohibitin were refractive to the apoptotic effects of camptothecin. The translocation was mediated by a putative nuclear export signal at the C-terminal region of prohibitin; fusion of the nuclear export signal (NES) of prohibitin to green fluorescence protein led to its export from the nucleus. Leptomycin B could inhibit the nuclear export of prohibitin showing that it was a CRM-1-dependent event driven by Ran GTPase. Confirming this, prohibitin was found to physically interact with CRM-1, and this interaction was significantly higher in transformed cells. Delivery of a peptide corresponding to the NES of prohibitin prevented the export of prohibitin to cytoplasm and protected cells from apoptosis. These results suggest that the regulated translocation of prohibitin from the nucleus to the mitochondria facilitates its pleiotropic functions and might contribute to its anti-proliferative and tumor suppressive properties.

TNF-alpha induces apoptosis sensitive to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected cells, despite sustained NF-kappaB activation. Our results indicate that the HBV infection induces sustained NF-kappaB activation, in a manner similar to the TNF-alpha stimulation. However, these effects are not merely combined. Computational simulations show that the level of form of the IKK complex activated by phosphorylation (IKK-p) affects the dynamic pattern of NF-kappaB activation during TNF-alpha stimulation in the following ways: (i) the initial level of IKK-p determines the incremental change in IKK-p at the same level of TNF-alpha stimulation, (ii) the incremental change in IKK-p determines the amplitudes of active NF-kappaB oscillation, and (iii) the steady state level of IKK-p after the incremental change determines the period of active NF-kappaB oscillation. Based on experiments, we observed that the initial level of IKK-p was upregulated and the active NF-kappaB oscillation showed smaller amplitudes for a shorter period in HepG2.2.15 cells (HBV-producing cells) during TNF-alpha stimulation, as was indicated by the computational simulations. Furthermore, we found that during TNF-alpha stimulation, NF-kappaB-regulated anti-apoptotic genes were upregulated in HepG2 cells but were downregulated in HepG2.2.15 cells. Based on the previously mentioned results, we can conclude that the IKK-p-level changes induced by HBV infection modulate the dynamic pattern of active NF-kappaB and thereby could affect NF-kappaB-regulated anti-apoptotic gene expressions. Finally, we postulate that the sensitive apoptotic response of HBV-infected cells to TNF-alpha stimulation is governed by the dynamic patterns of active NF-kappaB based on IKK-p level changes.

The NuMA-related Mud protein binds Pins and regulates spindle orientation
in Drosophila neuroblasts.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Asymmetric cell division generates cell diversity during development and regulates stem-cell self-renewal in Drosophila and mammals. In Drosophila, neuroblasts align their spindle with a cortical Partner of Inscuteable (Pins)-G alpha i crescent to divide asymmetrically, but the link between cortical polarity and the mitotic spindle is poorly understood. Here, we show that Pins directly binds, and coimmunoprecipitates with, the NuMA-related Mushroom body defect (Mud) protein. Pins recruits Mud to the neuroblast apical cortex, and Mud is also strongly localized to centrosome/spindle poles, in a similar way to NuMA. In mud mutants, cortical polarity is normal, but the metaphase spindle frequently fails to align with the cortical polarity axis. When spindle orientation is orthogonal to cell polarity, symmetric division occurs. We propose that Mud is a functional orthologue of mammalian NuMA and Caenorhabditis elegans Lin-5, and that Mud coordinates spindle orientation with cortical polarity to promote asymmetric cell division.

Relaxin stimulates leukocyte adhesion and migration through a relaxin

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Leukocytes are critical effectors of inflammation and tumor biology. Chemokine-like factors produced by such inflammatory sites are key mediators of tumor growth that activate leukocytic recruitment and tumor infiltration and suppress immune surveillance. Here we report that the endocrine peptide hormone, relaxin, is a regulator of leukocyte biology with properties important in recruitment to sites of inflammation. This study uses the human monocytic cell line THP-1 and normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to define a novel role for relaxin in regulation of leukocyte adhesion and migration. Our studies indicate that relaxin promotes adenylate cyclase activation, substrate adhesion, and migratory capacity of mononuclear leukocytes through a relaxin receptor LGR7-dependent mechanism. Relaxin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was observed to occur primarily in non-adherent cells. Relaxin stimulation results in increased substrate adhesion and increased migratory activity of leukocytes. In addition, relaxin-stimulated substrate adhesion resulted in enhanced chemotaxis to monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. These responses in THP-1 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells are relaxin dose-dependent and proportional to cAMP accumulation. We further demonstrate that LGR7 is critical for mediating these biological responses by use of RNA interference lentiviral short hairpin constructs. In summary, we provide evidence that relaxin is a novel leukocyte stimulatory agent with properties affecting adhesion and chemomigration.

<ABSTRACT>
Nuclear actin and myosin 1 (NM1) are key regulators of gene transcription. Here, we show by biochemical fractionation of nuclear extracts, protein-protein interaction studies and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that NM1 is part of a multiprotein complex that contains WICH, a chromatin remodelling complex containing WSTF (Williams syndrome transcription factor) and SNF2h. NM1, WSTF and SNF2h were found to be associated with RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA). RNA interference-mediated knockdown of NM1 and WSTF reduced pre-rRNA synthesis in vivo, and antibodies to WSTF inhibited Pol I transcription on pre-assembled chromatin templates but not on naked DNA. The results indicate that NM1 cooperates with WICH to facilitate transcription on chromatin.

<ABSTRACT>
The translation release factors (RFs) RF1 and RF2 of Escherichia coli are methylated at the N5-glutamine of the GGQ motif by PrmC methyltransferase. This motif is conserved in organisms from bacteria to higher eukaryotes. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFs, mitochondrial Mrf1p and cytoplasmic Sup45p (eRF1), have sequence similarities to the bacterial RFs, including the potential site of glutamine methylation in the GGQ motif. A computational analysis revealed two yeast proteins, Mtq1p and Mtq2p, that have strong sequence similarity to PrmC. Mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that Mtq1p and Mtq2p methylate Mrf1p and Sup45p, respectively, in vivo. A tryptic peptide of Mrf1p, GGQHVNTTDSAVR, containing the GGQ motif was found to be approximately 50% methylated at the glutamine residue in the normal strain but completely unmodified in the peptide from mtq1-Delta. Moreover, Mtq1p methyltransferase activity was observed in an in vitro assay. In similar experiments, it was determined that Mtq2p methylates Sup45p. The Sup45p methylation by Mtq2p was recently confirmed independently (Heurgue-Hamard, V., Champ, S., Mora, L., Merkulova-Rainon, T., Kisselev, L. L., and Buckingham, R. H. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 2439-2445). Analysis of the deletion mutants showed that although mtq1-Delta had only moderate growth defects on nonfermentable carbon sources, the mtq2-Delta had multiple phenotypes, including cold sensitivity and sensitivity to translation fidelity antibiotics paromomycin and geneticin, to high salt and calcium concentrations, to polymyxin B, and to caffeine. Also, the mitochondrial mit(-) mutation, cox2-V25, containing a premature stop mutation, was suppressed by mtq1-Delta. Most interestingly, the mtq2-Delta was significantly more resistant to the anti-microtubule drugs thiabendazole and benomyl, suggesting that Mtq2p may also methylate certain microtubule-related proteins.

Mechanism of fibre assembly through the chaperone-usher pathway.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The chaperone-usher pathway directs the formation of adhesive surface fibres in numerous pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. The fibres or pili consist exclusively of protein subunits that, before assembly, form transient complexes with a chaperone in the periplasm. In these chaperone:subunit complexes, the chaperone donates one beta-strand to complete the imperfect immunoglobulin-like fold of the subunit. During pilus assembly, the chaperone is replaced by a polypeptide extension of another subunit in a process termed 'donor strand exchange' (DSE). Here we show that DSE occurs in a concerted reaction in which a chaperone-bound acceptor subunit is attacked by another chaperone-bound donor subunit. We provide evidence that efficient DSE requires interactions between the reacting subunits in addition to those involving the attacking donor strand. Our results indicate that the pilus assembly platforms in the outer membrane, referred to as ushers, catalyse fibre formation by increasing the effective concentrations of donor and acceptor subunits.

<ABSTRACT>
Nuclear cytoplasmic O-GlcNAcase and acetyltransferase (NCOAT) is a bifunctional enzyme with both glycoside hydrolase and alkyltransferase activity. Its O-GlcNAcase active site lies in the N terminus of the enzyme and its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain lies in the C terminus. Whereas the HAT domain of the enzyme is catalytically and structurally similar to other acetyltransferases across subfamilies, NCOAT has a motif resembling a zinc finger-like domain unique to the MYST family of HATs. Among the MYST family, this zinc finger, or zinc finger-like domain, is responsible for making contacts with the histone tails within nucleosomes for the HAT to catalyze its respective reaction. Here, we show that NCOAT has the ability to directly associate with both an acetylated and unacetylated histone H4 tail in vitro, and a potential zinc finger-like motif found in NCOAT is implicated in this nucleosomal contact, and is necessary for fully efficient enzymatic activity. Subsequent to the catalysis of acetyltransfer to lysine 8 of histone H4 for the enzyme, however, the substrate is released and NCOAT can no longer bind H4 in our assays. Furthermore, this finger domain by itself is sufficient to bind histone H4.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Studies regarding the functions of the bovine papillomavirus (BPV) E5 oncoprotein in vivo are lacking and no E5-mediated mechanism underlying epithelial carcinogenesis is known. We have shown that BPV-2 DNA is present in the majority of naturally occurring urinary bladder tumours of cattle and that E5 is expressed in the cancer cells. Here we show that the interaction between the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) beta receptor and BPV E5, described in vitro in cultured cells, takes place in vivo in bovine urinary bladder cancers. In these cancers, E5 and PDGF beta receptor colocalize, as shown by confocal microscopy, and physically interact, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the PDGF beta receptor associated with E5 is highly phosphorylated, suggesting the functional activation of the receptor upon E5 interaction. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that E5-PDGF beta receptor interaction occurs during the natural history of bovine urinary bladder tumours, suggesting an important role for E5 in carcinogenesis. Finally, the system provides a suitable animal model of papillomavirus-associated cancer to test therapeutic vaccination against E5. Successful bladder tumour regression would provide a valuable model for therapeutic vaccination against papillomavirus-associated tumours.

PTEN tumor suppressor associates with NHERF proteins to attenuate PDGF
receptor signaling.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
PTEN, a tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in many human cancers, directly antagonizes the activity of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides. We show here that PTEN interacts directly with the NHERF1 and NHERF2 (Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor) homologous adaptor proteins through the PDZ motif of PTEN and the PDZ1 domain of NHERF1 or both PDZ domains of NHERF2. NHERFs were shown to interact directly with platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and we demonstrate the assembly of a ternary complex between PTEN, NHERFs and PDGFR. The activation of the PI3K pathway after PDGFR stimulation was prolonged in NHERF1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts as compared to wild-type cells, consistent with defective PTEN recruitment to PDGFR in the absence of NHERF1. Depletion of NHERF2 by small interfering RNA similarly increased PI3K signaling. Phenotypically, the loss of NHERF1 enhanced the PDGF-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements and chemotactic migration of the cells. These data indicate that, in normal cells, NHERF proteins recruit PTEN to PDGFR to restrict the activation of the PI3K.

polymerase II supports a scanning model.

<ABSTRACT>
Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) on Saccharomyces cerevisiae messenger RNA (mRNA) genes typically occurs at multiple sites 40-120 bp downstream of the TATA box. The mechanism that accommodates this extended and variable promoter architecture is unknown, but one model suggests that RNAP II forms an open promoter complex near the TATA box and then scans the template DNA strand for start sites. Unlike most protein-coding genes, small nuclear RNA gene transcription starts predominantly at a single position. We identify a highly efficient initiator element as the primary start site determinant for the yeast U4 small nuclear RNA gene, SNR14. Consistent with the scanning model, transcription of an SNR14 allele with tandemly duplicated start sites initiates primarily from the upstream site, yet the downstream site is recognized with equivalent efficiency by the diminished population of RNAP II molecules that encounter it. A quantitative in vivo assay revealed that SNR14 initiator efficiency is nearly perfect (approximately 90%), which explains the precision of U4 RNA 5' end formation. Initiator efficiency was reduced by cis-acting mutations at -8, -7, -1, and +1 and trans-acting substitutions in the TFIIB B-finger. These results expand our understanding of RNAP II initiation preferences and provide new support for the scanning model.

Polo-like kinase 1 regulates mitotic arrest after UV irradiation through

</TITLE>

<ABSTRACT>
Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation can result in cell cycle arrest. The reactivation of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is necessary for cell cycle reentry. But the mechanism of how Plk1 regulates p53 in UV-induced mitotic arrest cells remained elusive. Here we find that UV treatment leads HEK293 cells to inverse changes of Plk1 and p53. Over-expression of Plk1 rescue UV-induced mitotic arrest cells by inhibiting p53 activation. Plk1 could also inhibit p53 phosphorylation at Ser15, thus facilitates its nuclear export and degradation. Further examination shows that Plk1, p53 and Cdc25C can form a large complex. Plk1 could bind to the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain of p53 and active Cdc25C by hyperphosphorylation. These results hypothesize that Plk1 and Cdc25C participate in recovery the mitotic arrest through binding to the different domain of p53. Cdc25C may first be actived by Plk1, and then its phosphatase activity makes p53 dephosphorylated at Ser15.

DnaA couples DNA replication and the expression of two cell cycle master
regulators.

<ABSTRACT>
Cell cycle progression in Caulobacter is driven by the master transcriptional regulators CtrA and GcrA. The cellular levels of CtrA and GcrA are temporally and spatially out-of-phase during the cell cycle, with CtrA repressing gcrA transcription and GcrA activating ctrA transcription. Here, we show that DnaA, a protein required for the initiation of DNA replication, also functions as a transcriptional activator of gcrA, which in turn activates multiple genes, notably those involved in chromosome replication and segregation. The cellular concentration of DnaA is cell cycle-controlled, peaking at the time of replication initiation and gcrA induction. Regulated proteolysis of GcrA contributes to the cell cycle variations in GcrA abundance. We propose that DnaA couples DNA replication initiation with the expression of the two oscillating regulators GcrA and CtrA and that the DnaA/GcrA/CtrA regulatory cascade drives the forward progression of the Caulobacter cell cycle.

Self-refinement of Notch activity through the transmembrane protein
Crumbs: modulation of gamma-secretase activity.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cell interactions mediated by Notch family receptors have been implicated in the specification of tissue boundaries. Tightly localized activation of Notch is crucial for the formation of sharp boundaries. In the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, the Notch receptor is expressed in all cells. However, Notch activity is limited to a narrow stripe of cells along the dorsal-ventral compartment boundary, where it induces the expression of target genes. How a widely expressed protein becomes tightly regulated at the dorsal-ventral boundary in the Drosophila wing is not completely understood. Here, we show that the transmembrane protein Crumbs is involved in a feedback mechanism used by Notch to refine its own activation domain at the Drosophila wing margin. Crumbs reduces the activity of the gamma-Secretase complex, which mediates the proteolytic intracellular processing of Notch. These results indicate a novel molecular mechanism of the regulation of Notch signal, and also that defects in Crumbs might be involved in similar abnormal gamma-Secretase complex activity observed in Alzheimer's disease.

<ABSTRACT>
In skeletal muscle, dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) in the plasma membrane interact with the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) at junctions with the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This interaction organizes junctional DHPRs into groups of four termed tetrads. In addition to the principle alpha1S subunit, the beta1a subunit of the DHPR is also important for the interaction with RyR1. To probe this interaction, we measured fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of beta1a subunits labeled with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and/or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Expressed in dysgenic (alpha1S-null) myotubes, YFP-beta1a-CFP and CFP-beta1a-YFP were diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and highly mobile as indicated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Thus, beta1a does not appear to bind to other cellular proteins in the absence of alpha1S. FRET efficiencies for these cytoplasmic beta1a subunits were approximately 6-7%, consistent with the idea that <10 nm separates the N and C termini. After coexpression with unlabeled alpha1S (in dysgenic or beta1-null myotubes), both constructs produced discrete fluorescent puncta, which correspond to assembled DHPRs in junctions and that did not recover after photobleaching. In beta1-null myotubes, FRET efficiencies of doubly labeled beta1a in puncta were similar to those of the same constructs diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and appeared to arise intramolecularly, since no FRET was measured when mixtures of singly labeled beta1a (CFP or YFP at the N or C terminus) were expressed in beta1-null myotubes. Thus, DHPRs in tetrads may be arranged such that the N and C termini of adjacent beta1a subunits are located >10 nm from one another.

<ABSTRACT>
alpha-Synuclein is the major constituent of Lewy bodies, a pathological signature of Parkinson disease, found in the degenerating dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. Amyloidosis generating the insoluble fibrillar protein deposition has been considered to be responsible for the cell death observed in the neurodegenerative disorder. In order to develop a controlling strategy toward the amyloid formation, 1,1'-(1,10-decanediyl)-bis-[4-a-mino-2-methylquinolinium] (dequalinium), was selected and examined in terms of its specific molecular interaction with alpha-synuclein. The protein was self-oligomerized by dequalinium, which gave rise to the ladder formation on N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine/SDS-PAGE in the presence of a coupling reagent of N-(ethoxycarbonyl)-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline. The double-headed structure of dequalinium with the two cationic 4-aminoquinaldinium rings was demonstrated to be critical for the protein self-oligomerization. The dequalinium-binding site was located on the acidic C-terminal region of the protein with an approximate dissociation constant of 5.5 mum. The protein self-oligomerization induced by the compound has resulted in the protofibril formation of alpha-synuclein before it has developed into amyloids. The protofibrils were demonstrated to affect the membrane intactness of liposomes, and they have also been shown to influence cell viability of human neuroblastoma cells. In addition, dequalinium treatment of the alpha-synuclein-overexpressing cells exerted a significant cell death. Therefore, it is pertinent to consider that dequalinium could be used as a molecular probe to assess toxic mechanisms related to the amyloid formation of alpha-synuclein. Ultimately, the compound could be employed to develop therapeutic and preventive strategies toward alpha-synucleinopathies including Parkinson disease.

<ABSTRACT>
Cip/Kip family protein p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, is directly transactivated by retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) upon retinoic acid (RA):RARalpha binding. Yet the role of p21 upregulation by RA in lymphoma cells remains unknown. Here, we show that, in human pre-B lymphoma Nalm6 cells, RA-induced proliferation inhibition results from massive cell death characterized by apoptosis. Upregulated p21 by RA accompanies caspase-3 activation and precedes the occurrence of apoptosis. p21 induction leads to increased p21 complex formation with cyclin E/CDK2, which occurs when cyclin E and CDK2 levels remain constant. CDK2 can alternatively promote apoptosis, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Data presented here suggest a novel RA-signaling, by which RA-induced p21 induction and complex formation with cyclin E/CDK2 diverts CDK2 function from normally driving proliferation to alternatively promoting apoptosis.

The human growth hormone gene cluster locus control region supports
position-independent pituitary- and placenta-specific expression in the
transgenic mouse.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The human growth hormone (hGH) cluster contains five genes. The hGH-N gene is predominantly expressed in pituitary somatotropes, whereas the remaining four genes, the chorionic somatomammotropin genes (hCS-L, hCS-A, and hCS-B) and hGH-V, are expressed selectively in the placenta. In contrast, the mouse genome contains a single pituitary-specific GH gene and lacks any GH-related CS genes. Activation of the hGH transgene in the mouse is dependent on its linkage to a previously described locus control region (LCR) located -15 to -32 kilobases upstream of the hGH cluster. The sporadic, nonreproducible expression of hCS transgenes lacking the LCR suggests that they may be dependent on hGH LCR activity as well. To determine whether the hCS genes could be expressed with appropriate placental specificity, a series of five transgenic mouse lines carrying an 87-kilobase human genomic insert encompassing the majority of the hGH gene cluster and the entire contiguous LCR was established. All of the hGH cluster genes were appropriately expressed in each of these lines. High level expression of hGH was restricted to the pituitary and hCS to the labyrinthine layer of the placenta. The expression of the GH cluster genes in their respective tissues paralleled transgene copy numbers irrespective of the transgene insertion site in the host mouse genome. These studies have extended the utility of the transgenic mouse model for the analysis of the full spectrum of hGH gene cluster activation. Further, they support a role for the hGH LCR in placental hCS, as well as pituitary hGH gene activation, and expression.

variant of p63.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
p63, a member of the p53 family of transcription factors, is known to be involved in epithelial development. However, its role in tumorigenesis is unclear. Contributing to this uncertainty, the TP63 locus can express multiple gene products from two different promoters. Utilization of the upstream promoter results in expression of the TAp63 variant with an activation domain similar to p53. In contrast, the NH2-terminally deleted (DeltaN) p63 variant, transcribed from a cryptic promoter in intron 3, lacks such an activation domain. Thus, the TAp63 and DeltaNp63 variants possess a wide ranging ability to up-regulate p53 target genes. Consequentially, the disparity in transactivation potential between p63 variants has given rise to the hypothesis that the DeltaNp63 variant can serve as oncoprotein by opposing the activity of the TAp63 variant and p53. However, recent studies have revealed a transcriptional activity for DeltaNp63. This study was undertaken to address the transcriptional activity of the DeltaNp63 variant. Here, we showed that all NH2-terminally deleted p63 isoforms retain a potential in transactivation and growth suppression. Interestingly, DeltaNp63beta possesses a remarkable ability to suppress cell proliferation and transactivate target genes, which is consistently higher than that seen with DeltaNp63alpha. In contrast, DeltaNp63gamma has a weak or undetectable activity dependent upon the cell lines used. We also demonstrate that an intact DNA-binding domain is required for DeltaNp63 function. In addition, we found that the novel activation domain for the DeltaNp63 variant is composed of the 14 unique DeltaN residues along with the adjacent region, including a PXXP motif. Finally, we demonstrated that a PPXY motif shared by DeltaNp63alpha and DeltaNp63beta is required for optimal transactivation of target gene promoters, suggesting that the PPXY motif is requisite for DeltaNp63 function.

<ABSTRACT>
The onset of hen egg white lysozyme aggregation on exposure to alkaline pH of 12.2 and subsequent slow growth of soluble lysozyme aggregates (at 298 K) was directly monitored by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy of covalently attached dansyl probe over a period of 24 h. The rotational correlation time accounting for tumbling of lysozyme in solution (40 microM) increased from approximately 3.6 ns (in pH 7) to approximately 40ns on exposure to pH 12.2 over a period of 6 h and remained stable thereafter. The growth of aggregates was strongly concentration dependent, irreversible after 60 min and inhibited by the presence of 0.9 M l-arginine in the medium. The day old aggregates were resistant to denaturation by 6 M guanidine.HCl. Our results reveal slow segmental motion of the dansyl probe in day old aggregates in the absence of L-arginine (0.9 M), but a much faster motion in its presence, when growth of aggregates is halted.

<ABSTRACT>
Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5, omega-3) is the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in fish oil. Recent studies suggest that the beneficial effects of fish oil are due, in part, to the generation of various free radical-generated non-enzymatic bioactive oxidation products from omega-3 PUFAs, although the specific molecular species responsible for these effects have not been identified. Our research group has previously reported that pro-inflammatory prostaglandin F2-like compounds, termed F2-isoprostanes (IsoPs), are produced in vivo by the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid and represent one of the major products resulting from the oxidation of this PUFA. Based on these observations, we questioned whether F2-IsoP-like compounds (F3-IsoPs) are formed from the oxidation of EPA in vivo. Oxidation of EPA in vitro yielded a series of compounds that were structurally established to be F3-IsoPs using a number of chemical and mass spectrometric approaches. The amounts formed were extremely large (up to 8.7 + 1.0 microg/mg EPA) and greater than levels of F2-IsoPs generated from arachidonic acid. We then examined the formation of F3-IsoPs in vivo in mice. Levels of F3-IsoPs in tissues such as heart are virtually undetectable at baseline, but supplementation of animals with EPA markedly increases quantities up to 27.4 + 5.6 ng/g of heart. Interestingly, EPA supplementation also markedly reduced levels of pro-inflammatory arachidonate-derived F2-IsoPs by up to 64% (p < 0.05). Our studies provide the first evidence that identify F3-IsoPs as novel oxidation products of EPA that are generated in vivo. Further understanding of the biological consequences of F3-IsoP formation may provide valuable insights into the cardioprotective mechanism of EPA.

Critical role for Daxx in regulating Mdm2.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The tumour suppressor p53 induces apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest in response to genotoxic and other stresses. In unstressed cells, the anti-proliferative effects of p53 are restrained by mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2), a ubiquitin ligase (E3) that promotes p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Mdm2 also mediates its own degradation through auto-ubiquitination. It is unclear how the cis- and trans-E3 activities of Mdm2, which have opposing effects on cell fate, are differentially regulated. Here, we show that death domain-associated protein (Daxx) is required for Mdm2 stability. Downregulation of Daxx decreases Mdm2 levels, whereas overexpression of Daxx strongly stabilizes Mdm2. Daxx simultaneously binds to Mdm2 and the deubiquitinase Hausp, and it mediates the stabilizing effect of Hausp on Mdm2. In addition, Daxx enhances the intrinsic E3 activity of Mdm2 towards p53. On DNA damage, Daxx dissociates from Mdm2, which correlates with Mdm2 self-degradation. These findings reveal that Daxx modulates the function of Mdm2 at multiple levels and suggest that the disruption of the Mdm2-Daxx interaction may be important for p53 activation in response to DNA damage.

PIASxbeta acts as an activator of Hoxb1 and is antagonized by Krox20
during hindbrain segmentation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The zinc-finger transcription factor Krox20 constitutes a key regulator of hindbrain development, essential for the formation and specification of rhombomeres (r) 3 and 5. It is in particular responsible for the respective activation and repression of odd- and even-numbered rhombomere-specific genes, which include Hox genes. In this study, we have identified PIASxbeta as a novel direct interactor of Krox20. In addition, we found that PIASxbeta is able to activate the r4-specific gene Hoxb1. Binding of Krox20 prevents this activation, providing a molecular basis for the repression of Hoxb1 by Krox20. The same domain in the Krox20 protein, the zinc-fingers, is involved in DNA binding for transcriptional activation and in interaction with PIASxbeta for transcriptional repression, although the actual precise contacts are different. Our findings add an additional level in the complexity of Hox gene regulation and provide an example of how a single regulator can coordinate the activation and repression of a set of genes by very different mechanisms, acting as a molecular switch to specify cell identity and fate.

Helicobacter pylori encoding the pathogenicity island activates matrix

<ABSTRACT>
Helicobacter pylori colonizes the human gastric epithelium and induces an inflammatory response that is a trigger for gastric carcinogenesis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have recently been shown to be up-regulated in gastric epithelial cells infected with H. pylori and might contribute to the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer. The aim of this study was to extend the knowledge about the effect of H. pylori infection on MMP-1 expression by gastric epithelial cells, the kinetics of induction, the pathogenetic properties of the bacterium, and the intracellular signaling pathways required for MMP-1 up-regulation. Expression of MMP-1 was induced more than 10-fold by co-culture of AGS+cells with H. pylori strains carrying the pathogenicity island (PAI). H. pylori strains with mutations in the PAI and a defective type IV secretion system had no effect on MMP-1. Double immunofluorescence revealed strong MMP-1 staining in epithelial cells of gastric biopsies at sites of bacterial attachment. In vitro, MMP-1 is up-regulated by interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, but these regulatory mechanisms are not operating in H. pylori infection as shown by inhibitory antibodies. Specific inhibitors of JNK kinase and ERK1/2 kinase were found to suppress the H. pylori-induced MMP-1 expression and activity. AGS cells treated with antisense MMP-1 showed a significantly reduced potential to degrade reconstituted basement membrane. Our results suggest that in gastric epithelial cells, H. pylori up-regulates MMP-1 in a type IV secretion system-dependent manner via JNK and ERK1/2. Induction of MMP-1 is further implicated in complex processes induced by H. pylori, resulting in tissue degradation and remodeling of the gastric mucosa.

Vaccinia virus uracil DNA glycosylase interacts with the A20 protein to
form a heterodimeric processivity factor for the viral DNA polymerase.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The vaccinia virus E9 protein, the catalytic subunit of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme, is inherently distributive under physiological conditions, although infected cells contain a highly processive form of the enzyme. The viral A20 protein was previously characterized as a stoichiometric component of the processivity factor, and an interaction between A20 and E9 was documented in vivo. A20 has been shown to interact with D4, the virally encoded uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), by yeast-two hybrid and in vitro analysis. Here we confirm that UDG and A20 interact in vivo and show that temperature-sensitive viruses with lesions in the D4R gene show a profound defect in DNA synthesis at the non-permissive temperature. Moreover, cytoplasmic extracts prepared from these infections lack processive polymerase activity in vitro, implicating D4 in the assembly or activity of the processive polymerase. Upon overexpression of 3xFLAG-UDG, A20, and E9 in various combinations, we purified dimeric and trimeric UDG-A20 and UDG-A20-polymerase complexes, respectively. These complexes are stable in 750 mm NaCl and can be further purified by Mono Q chromatography. Notably, the trimeric complex displays robust processive polymerase activity, and the dimeric complex can confer processivity on purified E9. Consistent with previous reports that the catalytic activity of UDG is dispensable for virus replication in tissue culture, we find that the role of UDG role in the polymerase complex is not diminished by mutations targeting residues involved in uracil recognition or excision. Our cumulative data support the conclusion that A20 and UDG form a heterodimeric processivity factor that associates with E9 to comprise the processive polymerase holoenzyme.

Platelet-activating factor mediates MMP-2 expression and activation via
phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein and contributes
to melanoma metastasis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Overexpression of cAMP-response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor (ATF) 1 contributes to melanoma progression and metastasis at least in part by promoting tumor cell survival and stimulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 expression. However, little is known about the regulation of CREB and ATF-1 activities and their phosphorylation within the tumor microenvironment. We analyzed the effect of platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent phospholipid mediator of inflammation, for its ability to activate CREB and ATF-1 in eight cultured human melanoma cell lines, and we found that PAF receptor (PAFR) was expressed in all eight lines. In metastatic melanoma cell lines, PAF induced CREB and ATF-1 phosphorylation via a PAFR-mediated signal transduction mechanism that required pertussis toxin-insensitive Galphaq protein and adenylate cyclase activity and was antagonized by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and p38 MAPK inhibitors. Addition of PAF to metastatic A375SM cells stimulated CRE-dependent transcription, as observed in a luciferase reporter assay, without increasing the CRE DNA binding capacity of CREB. Furthermore, PAF stimulated the gelatinase activity of MMP-2 by activating transcription and MMP-2 expression. MMP-2 activation correlated with the PAF-induced increase in the expression of an MMP-2 activator, membrane type 1 MMP. PAF-induced expression of pro-MMP-2 was causally related to PAF-induced CREB and ATF-1 phosphorylation; it was prevented by PAFR antagonist and inhibitors of p38 MAPK and protein kinase A and was abrogated upon quenching of CREB and ATF-1 activities by forced overexpression of a dominant-negative form of CREB. PAF-induced MMP-2 activation was also down-regulated by p38 MAPK and protein kinase A inhibitors. Finally, PAFR antagonist PCA4248 inhibited the development of A375SM lung metastasis in nude mice. This result indicated that PAF acts as a promoter of melanoma metastasis in vivo. We proposed that metastatic melanoma cells overexpressing CREB/ATF-1 are better equipped than nonmetastatic cells to respond to PAF within the tumor microenvironment.

An arginine/lysine-rich motif is crucial for VCP/p97-mediated modulation
of ataxin-3 fibrillogenesis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Arginine/lysine-rich motifs typically function as targeting signals for the translocation of proteins to the nucleus. Here, we demonstrate that such a motif consisting of four basic amino acids in the polyglutamine protein ataxin-3 (Atx-3) serves as a recognition site for the interaction with the molecular chaperone VCP. Through this interaction, VCP modulates the fibrillogenesis of pathogenic forms of Atx-3 in a concentration-dependent manner, with low concentrations of VCP stimulating fibrillogenesis and excess concentrations suppressing it. No such effect was observed with a mutant Atx-3 variant, which does not contain a functional VCP interaction motif. Strikingly, a stretch of four basic amino acids in the ubiquitin chain assembly factor E4B was also discovered to be critical for VCP binding, indicating that arginine/lysine-rich motifs might be generally utilized by VCP for the targeting of proteins. In vivo studies with Drosophila models confirmed that VCP selectively modulates aggregation and neurotoxicity induced by pathogenic Atx-3. Together, these results define the VCP-Atx-3 association as a potential target for therapeutic intervention and suggest that it might influence the progression of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

Neuronal p38 MAPK signalling: an emerging regulator of cell fate and

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), together with extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), constitute the MAPK family. Multiple intracellular signalling pathways that converge on MAPKs exist in all eukaryotic cells and play pivotal roles in a wide variety of cellular functions. p38 MAPKs and JNKs, also termed stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), are preferentially activated by various cytotoxic stresses and cytokines and appear to be potent regulators of stress-induced apoptosis. Whereas JNKs have been shown to play pivotal roles in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis, the role of p38 MAPKs in the nervous system is poorly understood. However, accumulating evidence from mammalian cell culture systems and the strong genetic tool C. elegans suggests that neuronal p38 signalling has diverse functions beyond the control of cell death and survival. This review focuses on possible roles for the p38 pathway in the nervous system, with principal emphasis placed on the roles in neuronal cell fate decision and function.

Vitamin B6 biosynthesis by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum:
biochemical and structural insights.

<ABSTRACT>
Vitamin B6 is one of nature's most versatile cofactors. Most organisms synthesize vitamin B6 via a recently discovered pathway employing the proteins Pdx1 and Pdx2. Here we present an in-depth characterization of the respective orthologs from the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Expression profiling of Pdx1 and -2 shows that blood-stage parasites indeed possess a functional vitamin B6 de novo biosynthesis. Recombinant Pdx1 and Pdx2 form a complex that functions as a glutamine amidotransferase with Pdx2 as the glutaminase and Pdx1 as pyridoxal-5 '-phosphate synthase domain. Complex formation is required for catalytic activity of either domain. Pdx1 forms a chimeric bi-enzyme with the bacterial YaaE, a Pdx2 ortholog, both in vivo and in vitro, although this chimera does not attain full catalytic activity, emphasizing that species-specific structural features govern the interaction between the protein partners of the PLP synthase complexes in different organisms. To gain insight into the activation mechanism of the parasite bi-enzyme complex, the three-dimensional structure of Pdx2 was determined at 1.62 A. The obstruction of the oxyanion hole indicates that Pdx2 is in a resting state and that activation occurs upon Pdx1-Pdx2 complex formation.

Functional analysis of the bacteriophage T4 DNA-packaging ATPase motor.

<ABSTRACT>
Packaging of double-stranded DNA into bacteriophage capsids is driven by one of the most powerful force-generating motors reported to date. The phage T4 motor is constituted by gene product 16 (gp16) (18 kDa; small terminase), gp17 (70 kDa; large terminase), and gp20 (61 kDa; dodecameric portal). Extensive sequence alignments revealed that numerous phage and viral large terminases encode a common Walker-B motif in the N-terminal ATPase domain. The gp17 motif consists of a highly conserved aspartate (Asp255) preceded by four hydrophobic residues (251MIYI254), which are predicted to form a beta-strand. Combinatorial mutagenesis demonstrated that mutations that compromised hydrophobicity, or integrity of the beta-strand, resulted in a null phenotype, whereas certain changes in hydrophobicity resulted in cs/ts phenotypes. No substitutions, including a highly conservative glutamate, are tolerated at the conserved aspartate. Biochemical analyses revealed that the Asp255 mutants showed no detectable in vitro DNA packaging activity. The purified D255E, D255N, D255T, D255V, and D255E/E256D mutant proteins exhibited defective ATP binding and very low or no gp16-stimulated ATPase activity. The nuclease activity of gp17 is, however, retained, albeit at a greatly reduced level. These data define the N-terminal ATPase center in terminases and show for the first time that subtle defects in the ATP-Mg complex formation at this center lead to a profound loss of phage DNA packaging.

An Arabidopsis Fip1 homolog interacts with RNA and provides conceptual

<ABSTRACT>
The protein Fip1 is an important subunit of the eukaryotic polyadenylation apparatus, since it provides a bridge of sorts between poly(A) polymerase, other subunits of the polyadenylation apparatus, and the substrate RNA. In this study, a previously unreported Arabidopsis Fip1 homolog is characterized. The gene for this protein resides on chromosome V and encodes a 1196-amino acid polypeptide. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro assays indicate that the N-terminal 137 amino acids of the Arabidopsis Fip1 protein interact with poly(A) polymerase (PAP). This domain also stimulates the activity of the PAP. Interestingly, this part of the Arabidopsis Fip1 interacts with Arabidopsis homologs of CstF77, CPSF30, CFIm-25, and PabN1. The interactions with CstF77, CPSF30, and CFIm-25 are reminiscent in various respects of similar interactions seen in yeast and mammals, although the part of the Arabidopsis Fip1 protein that participates in these interactions has no apparent counterpart in other eukaryotic Fip1 proteins. Interactions between Fip1 and PabN1 have not been reported in other systems; this may represent plant-specific associations. The C-terminal 789 amino acids of the Arabidopsis Fip1 protein were found to contain an RNA-binding domain; this domain correlated with an intact arginine-rich region and had a marked preference for poly(G) among the four homopolymers studied. These results indicate that the Arabidopsis Fip1, like its human counterpart, is an RNA-binding protein. Moreover, they provide conceptual links between PAP and several other Arabidopsis polyadenylation factor subunit homologs.

<ABSTRACT>
Lipid droplets (LDs), also called adiposomes, are found in many eukaryotic cells, and are highly upregulated in lipid-storage cells, such as adipocytes. The mechanism by which adiposomes and their component neutral lipids are degraded is an important health issue with the rapidly spreading epidemic of obesity. Recently, a novel triglyceride lipase (adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL)) that catalyses the initial step in triglyceride hydrolysis in adipocyte LDs was identified. Here, we show that ATGL also functions in non-adipocyte cells, and has an important role in LD degradation in these cells. Overexpression of wild-type ATGL causes a marked decrease in LD size, whereas a catalytically inactive mutant retains the ability to localize to LDs, but is unable to decrease their size. Depletion of ATGL by RNA interference leads to a significant increase in the size of LDs. These results show that ATGL has an important role in LD/adiposome turnover in mammalian cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Rad23 proteins bind ubiquitinated substrates and the proteasome, consistent with an important role in protein degradation. Although human Rad23 proteins (hHR23A and hHR23B) have redundant roles in DNA repair, we determined they formed distinct interactions with proteasomes and multiubiquitinated proteins, but similar binding to Ataxin-3. Threonine-79 contributed to the weak proteasome-binding property of hHR23A, and its conversion to proline (T79P), which is the residue present in hHR23B, increased proteasome interaction. We also determined that hHR23A and hHR23B could be co-purified with unique proteolytic and stress-responsive factors from human breast cancer tissues, indicating that they have unique functions in vivo.

<ABSTRACT>
The dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase-binding protein (E3BP) and the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) component enzyme form the structural core of the human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by providing the binding sites for two other component proteins, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), as well as pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases and phosphatases. Despite a high similarity between the primary structures of E3BP and E2, the E3-binding domain of human E3BP is highly specific to human E3, whereas the E1-binding domain of human E2 is highly specific to human E1. In this study, we characterized binding of human E3 to the E3-binding domain of E3BP by x-ray crystallography at 2.6-angstroms resolution, and we used this structural information to interpret the specificity for selective binding. Two subunits of E3 form a single recognition site for the E3-binding domain of E3BP through their hydrophobic interface. The hydrophobic residues Pro133, Pro154, and Ile157 in the E3-binding domain of E3BP insert themselves into the surface of both E3 polypeptide chains. Numerous ionic and hydrogen bonds between the residues of three interacting polypeptide chains adjacent to the central hydrophobic patch add to the stability of the subcomplex. The specificity of pairing for human E3BP with E3 is interpreted from its subcomplex structure to be most likely due to conformational rigidity of the binding fragment of the E3-binding domain of E3BP and its exquisite amino acid match with the E3 target interface.

Distinct functions of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway influence
nucleotide excision repair.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Rad23/Rad4 nucleotide excision repair (NER) protein complex functions at an early stage of the NER reaction, possibly promoting the recognition of damaged DNA. Here we show that Rad4 protein is ubiquitinated and degraded in response to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and identify a novel cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligase required for this process. We also show that this novel ubiquitin ligase is required for optimal NER. Our results demonstrate that optimal NER correlates with the ubiquitination of Rad4 following UV radiation, but not its subsequent degradation. Furthermore, we show that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) regulates NER via two distinct mechanisms. The first occurs independently of de novo protein synthesis, and requires Rad23 and a nonproteolytic function of the 19S regulatory complex of the 26S proteasome. The second requires de novo protein synthesis, and relies on the activity of the newly identified E3 ubiquitin ligase. These studies reveal that, following UV radiation, NER is mediated by nonproteolytic activities of the UPP, via the ubiquitin-like domain of Rad23 and UV radiation-induced ubiquitination of Rad4.

<ABSTRACT>
A previous study has illustrated that the alphaVbeta3 integrin served as the functional receptor for West Nile virus (WNV) entry into cells. Domain III (DIII) of WNV envelope protein (E) was postulated to mediate virus binding to the cellular receptor. In this study, the specificity and affinity binding of WNV E DIII protein to alphaVbeta3 integrin was confirmed with co-immunoprecipitation and receptor competition assay. Binding of WNV E DIII protein to alphaVbeta3 integrin induced the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase that is required to mediate ligand-receptor internalization into cells. A novel platform was then developed using the atomic force microscopy to measure this specific binding force between WNV E DIII protein and the cellular receptor, alphaVbeta3 integrin. The single protein pair-interacting force measured was in the range of 45 +/- 5 piconewtons. This interacting force was highly specific as minimal force was measured in the WNV E DIII protein interaction with alphaVbeta5 integrin molecules and heparan sulfate. These experiments provided an insight to quantitate virus-receptor interaction. Force measurement using atomic force microscopy can serve to quantitatively analyze the effect of candidate drugs that modulate virus-host receptor affinity.

Antiviral effect of the mammalian translation initiation factor 2alpha

<ABSTRACT>
In mammals, four different protein kinases, heme-regulated inhibitor, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2) and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, regulate protein synthesis in response to environmental stresses by phosphorylating the alpha-subunit of the initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). We now report that mammalian GCN2 is specifically activated in vitro upon binding of two nonadjacent regions of the Sindbis virus (SV) genomic RNA to its histidyl-tRNA synthetase-related domain. Moreover, endogenous GCN2 is activated in cells upon SV infection. Strikingly, fibroblasts derived from GCN2-/- mice possess an increased permissiveness to SV or vesicular stomatitis virus infection. We further show that mice lacking GCN2 are extremely susceptible to intranasal SV infection, demonstrating high virus titers in the brain compared to similarly infected control animals. The overexpression of wild-type GCN2, but not the catalytically inactive GCN2-K618R variant, in NIH 3T3 cells impaired the replication of a number of RNA viruses. We determined that GCN2 inhibits SV replication by blocking early viral translation of genomic SV RNA. These findings point to a hitherto unrecognized role of GCN2 as an early mediator in the cellular response to RNA viruses.

A beta-arrestin binding determinant common to the second intracellular
loops of rhodopsin family G protein-coupled receptors.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
beta-Arrestins have been shown to inhibit competitively G protein-dependent signaling and to mediate endocytosis for many of the hundreds of nonvisual rhodopsin family G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). An open question of fundamental importance concerning the regulation of signal transduction of several hundred rhodopsin-like GPCRs is how these receptors of limited sequence homology, when considered in toto, can all recruit and activate the two highly conserved beta-arrestin proteins as part of their signaling/desensitization process. Although the serine and threonine residues that form GPCR kinase phosphorylation sites are common beta-arrestin-associated receptor determinants regulating receptor desensitization and internalization, the agonist-activated conformation of a GPCR probably reveals the most fundamental determinant mediating the GPCR and arrestin interaction. Here we identified a beta-arrestin binding determinant common to the rhodopsin family GPCRs formed from the proximal 10 residues of the second intracellular loop. We demonstrated by both gain and loss of function studies for the serotonin 2C, beta2-adrenergic, alpha2a)adrenergic, and neuropeptide Y type 2 receptors that the highly conserved amino acids, proline and alanine, naturally occurring in rhodopsin family receptors six residues distal to the highly conserved second loop DRY motif regulate beta-arrestin binding and beta-arrestin-mediated internalization. In particular, as demonstrated for the beta2 AR, this occurs independently of changes in GPCR kinase phosphorylation. These results suggest that a GPCR conformation directed by the second intracellular loop, likely using the loop itself as a binding patch, may function as a switch for transitioning beta-arrestin from its inactive form to its active receptor-binding state.

We addressed the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of cancer-associated B7-H1 expression in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Using promoter constructs in luciferase assay, the region between 202 and 320 bp from the translational start site is responsible for B7-H1 expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay, site-directed mutagenesis and knockdown experiment using siRNA revealed that interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is primarily responsible for the constitutive B7-H1 expression as well as for the IFN-gamma-mediated B7-H1 upregulation in a human lung cancer cell line A549. Additionally, AG490, a Janus activated kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription inhibitor, greatly abolished the responsiveness of A549 cells to IFN-gamma by reducing the IRF-1 transcription. Our findings support a critical role of IRF-1 in the regulation of constitutive and IFN-gamma-induced expression of B7-H1 in cancer cells.

Signal-dependent control of gluconeogenic key enzyme genes through
coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1.

<ABSTRACT>
Together with impaired glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, elevated hepatic gluconeogenesis is largely responsible for the hyperglycemic phenotype in type II diabetic patients. Intracellular glucocorticoid and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A-dependent signaling pathways contribute to aberrant hepatic glucose production through the induction of gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression. Here we show that the coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is required for cAMP-mediated activation of rate-limiting gluconeogenic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; EC 4.1.1.32) and glucose-6-phosphatase genes. Mutational analysis showed that CARM1 mediates its effect via the cAMP-responsive element within the PEPCK promoter, which is identified here as a CARM1 target in vivo. In hepatocytes, endogenous CARM1 physically interacts with cAMP-responsive element binding factor CREB and is recruited to the PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase promoters in a cAMP-dependent manner associated with increased promoter methylation. CARM1 might, therefore, represent a critical component of cAMP-dependent glucose metabolism in the liver.

The role of the epsilon subunit in the Escherichia coli ATP synthase. The
C-terminal domain is required for efficient energy coupling.

<ABSTRACT>
The role of the C-domain of the epsilon subunit of ATP synthase was investigated by fusing either the 20-kDa flavodoxin (Fd) or the 5-kDa chitin binding domain (CBD) to the N termini of both full-length epsilon and a truncation mutant epsilon(88-stop). All mutant epsilon proteins were stable in cells and supported F1F0 assembly. Cells expressing the Fd-epsilon or Fd-epsilon(88-stop) mutants were unable to grow on acetate minimal medium, indicating their inability to carry out oxidative phosphorylation because of steric blockage of rotation. The other forms of epsilon supported growth on acetate. Membrane vesicles containing Fd-epsilon showed 23% of the wild type ATPase activity but no proton pumping, suggesting that the ATP synthase is intrinsically partially uncoupled. Vesicles containing CBD-epsilon were indistinguishable from the wild type in ATPase activity and proton pumping, indicating that the N-terminal fusions alone do not promote uncoupling. Fd-epsilon(88-stop) caused higher rates of uncoupled ATP hydrolysis than Fd-epsilon, and epsilon(88-stop) showed an increased rate of membrane-bound ATP hydrolysis but decreased proton pumping relative to the wild type. Both results demonstrate the role of the C-domain in coupling. Analysis of the wild type and epsilon(88-stop) mutant membrane ATPase activities at concentrations of ATP from 50 mum to 8 mm showed no significant dependence of the ratio of bound/released ATPase activity on ATP concentration. These results support the hypothesis that the main function of the C-domain in the Escherichia coli epsilon subunit is to reduce uncoupled ATPase activity, rather than to regulate coupled activity.

<ABSTRACT>
The colony-forming ability of Escherichia coli genetically engineered to produce eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) grown in 3mM hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was similar to that of untreated cells. It was rapidly lost in the absence of EPA. H(2)O(2)-induced protein carbonylation was enhanced in cells lacking EPA. The fatty acid composition of the transformants was unaffected by H(2)O(2) treatment, but the amount of fatty acids decreased in cultures of cells lacking EPA and increased in cultures of cells producing EPA, suggesting that cellular EPA is stable in the presence of H(2)O(2) in vivo and may protect cells directly against oxidative damage. We discuss the possible role of EPA in partially blocking the penetration of H(2)O(2) into cells through membranes containing EPA.

Novel fluorescent prothrombin analogs as probes of

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Staphylocoagulase (SC) is a potent nonproteolytic prothrombin (ProT) activator and the prototype of a newly established zymogen activator and adhesion protein family. The staphylocoagulase fragment containing residues 1-325 (SC-(1-325)) represents a new type of nonproteolytic activator with a unique fold consisting of two three-helix bundle domains. The N-terminal, domain 1 of SC (D1, residues 1-146) interacts with the 148 loop of thrombin and prethrombin 2 and the south rim of the catalytic site, whereas domain 2 of SC (D2, residues 147-325) occupies (pro)exosite I, the fibrinogen (Fbg) recognition exosite. Reversible conformational activation of ProT by SC-(1-325) was used to create novel analogs of ProT covalently labeled at the catalytic site with fluorescence probes. Analogs selected from screening 10 such derivatives were used to characterize quantitatively equilibrium binding of SC-(1-325) to ProT, competitive binding with native ProT, and SC domain interactions. The results support the conclusion that SC-(1-325) binds to a single site on fluorescein-labeled and native ProT with indistinguishable dissociation constants of 17-72 pM. The results obtained for isolated SC domains indicate that D2 binds ProT with approximately 130-fold greater affinity than D1, yet D1 binding accounts for the majority of the fluorescence enhancement that accompanies SC-(1-325) binding. The SC-(1-325).(pro)thrombin complexes and free thrombin showed little difference in substrate specificity for tripeptide substrates or with their natural substrate, Fbg. Lack of a significant effect of blockage of (pro)exosite I of (pro)thrombin by SC-(1-325) on Fbg cleavage indicates that a new Fbg substrate recognition exosite is expressed on the SC-(1-325).(pro)thrombin complexes. Our results provide new insight into the mechanism that mediates zymogen activation by this prototypical bacterial activator.

<ABSTRACT>
Occludin is an integral-membrane protein that contributes to tight junction function. We have identified casein kinase I epsilon (CKI epsilon) as a binding partner for the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of occludin by yeast two-hybrid screening. CKI epsilon phosphorylated occludin and co-localised and co-immunoprecipitated with occludin from human endothelial cells. Amino acids 265-318 of occludin were sufficient for CKI epsilon binding and phosphorylation. Deletion of the C-terminal 48 amino acids of occludin increased CKI epsilon binding and phosphorylation, suggesting that this region inhibits CKI epsilon binding. These data identify CKI epsilon as a novel occludin kinase that may be important for the regulation of occludin.

<ABSTRACT>
The key DNA cutting and joining steps of retroviral DNA integration are carried out by the viral integrase protein. Structures of the individual domains of integrase have been determined, but their organization in the active complex with viral DNA is unknown. We show that HIV-1 integrase forms stable synaptic complexes in which a tetramer of integrase is stably associated with a pair of viral DNA ends. The viral DNA is processed within these complexes, which go on to capture the target DNA and integrate the viral DNA ends. The joining of the two viral DNA ends to target DNA occurs sequentially, with a stable intermediate complex in which only one DNA end is joined. The integration product also remains stably associated with integrase and likely requires disassembly before completion of the integration process by cellular enzymes. The results define the series of stable nucleoprotein complexes that mediate retroviral DNA integration.

<ABSTRACT>
Glycogen and starch synthases are retaining glycosyltransferases that catalyze the transfer of glucosyl residues to the non-reducing end of a growing alpha-1,4-glucan chain, a central process of the carbon/energy metabolism present in almost all living organisms. The crystal structure of the glycogen synthase from Pyrococcus abyssi, the smallest known member of this family of enzymes, revealed that its subunits possess a fold common to other glycosyltransferases, a pair of beta/alpha/beta Rossmann fold-type domains with the catalytic site at their interface. Nevertheless, the archaeal enzyme presents an unprecedented homotrimeric molecular arrangement both in solution, as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation, and in the crystal. The C-domains are not involved in intersubunit interactions of the trimeric molecule, thus allowing for movements, likely required for catalysis, across the narrow hinge that connects the N- and C-domains. The radial disposition of the subunits confers on the molecule a distinct triangular shape, clearly visible with negative staining electron microscopy, in which the upper and lower faces present a sharp asymmetry. Comparison of bacterial and eukaryotic glycogen synthases, which use, respectively, ADP or UDP glucose as donor substrates, with the archaeal enzyme, which can utilize both molecules, allowed us to propose the residues that determine glucosyl donor specificity.

<ABSTRACT>
Mutations in alpha-synuclein gene cause familial form of Parkinson disease, and deposition of wild-type alpha-synuclein as Lewy bodies occurs as a hallmark lesion of sporadic Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, implicating alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease and related neurodegenerative diseases. Dopamine neurons in substantia nigra are the major site of neurodegeneration associated with alpha-synuclein deposition in Parkinson disease. Here we establish transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (TG worms) that overexpresses wild-type or familial Parkinson mutant human alpha-synuclein in dopamine neurons. The TG worms exhibit accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the cell bodies and neurites of dopamine neurons, and EGFP labeling of dendrites is often diminished in TG worms expressing familial Parkinson disease-linked A30P or A53T mutant alpha-synuclein, without overt loss of neuronal cell bodies. Notably, TG worms expressing A30P or A53T mutant alpha-synuclein show failure in modulation of locomotory rate in response to food, which has been attributed to the function of dopamine neurons. This behavioral abnormality was accompanied by a reduction in neuronal dopamine content and was treatable by administration of dopamine. These phenotypes were not seen upon expression of beta-synuclein. The present TG worms exhibit dopamine neuron-specific dysfunction caused by accumulation of alpha-synuclein, which would be relevant to the genetic and compound screenings aiming at the elucidation of pathological cascade and therapeutic strategies for Parkinson disease.

<ABSTRACT>
The plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE) require calcineurin B homologous protein (CHP) as an obligatory binding partner for ion transport. Here, we report the first crystal structure of CHP (CHP2 isoform) in complex with its binding domain in NHE1. We show that the cytoplasmic alpha-helix of NHE1 is inserted into the hydrophobic cleft formed by N- and C-lobes of CHP2 and that the size and shape of this crevice together with hydrogen bond formation at multiple positions assure a high degree of specificity for interaction with NHE members. Structure-based mutagenesis revealed the importance of hydrophobic interactions between CHP/NHE1 for the function of NHE1. Furthermore, the crystal structure shows the existence of a protruding CHP-unique region, and deletion of this region in CHP2 inhibited the NHE1 activity by inducing the acidic shift of intracellular pH dependence, while preserving interaction with NHE1. These findings suggest that CHP serves as an obligatory subunit that is required both for supporting the basic activity and regulating the pH-sensing of NHE1 via interactions between distinct parts of these proteins.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The human transferrin receptor (TfR) is shed by an integral metalloprotease releasing a soluble form (sTfR) into serum. The sTfR reflects the iron demand of the body and is postulated as a regulator of iron homeostasis via binding to the hereditary hemochromatosis protein HFE. To study the role of transferrin in this process, we investigated TfR shedding in HL60 cells and TfR-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human TfR. Independent of TfR expression, sTfR release decreases with increasing ferritransferrin concentrations, whereas apo-transferrin exhibits no inhibitory effect. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we generated several TfR mutants with different binding affinities for transferrin. Shedding of TfR mutants in transfected cells correlates exactly with their binding affinity, implying that the effect of ferritransferrin on TfR shedding is mediated by a direct molecular interaction. Analysis of sTfR release from purified microsomal membranes revealed that the regulation is independent from intracellular trafficking or cellular signaling events. Our results clearly demonstrated that sTfR does not only reflect the iron demand of the cells but also the iron availability in the bloodstream, mirrored by iron saturation of transferrin, corroborating the important potential function of sTfR as a regulator of iron homeostasis.

CDK-dependent phosphorylation of BRCA2 as a regulatory mechanism for
recombinational repair.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Inherited mutations in BRCA2 are associated with a predisposition to early-onset breast cancers. The underlying basis of tumorigenesis is thought to be linked to defects in DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination. Here we show that the carboxy-terminal region of BRCA2, which interacts directly with the essential recombination protein RAD51, contains a site (serine 3291; S3291) that is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases. Phosphorylation of S3291 is low in S phase when recombination is active, but increases as cells progress towards mitosis. This modification blocks C-terminal interactions between BRCA2 and RAD51. However, DNA damage overcomes cell cycle regulation by decreasing S3291 phosphorylation and stimulating interactions with RAD51. These results indicate that S3291 phosphorylation might provide a molecular switch to regulate RAD51 recombination activity, providing new insight into why BRCA2 C-terminal deletions lead to radiation sensitivity and cancer predisposition.

Cholesterol-dependent localization of NAP-22 on a neuronal membrane
microdomain (raft).

<ABSTRACT>
A membrane microdomain called raft has been under extensive study since the assembly of various signal-transducing molecules into this region has been envisaged. This domain is isolated as a low buoyant membrane fraction after the extraction with a nonionic detergent such as Triton X-100. The characteristic low density of this fraction is ascribed to the enrichment of several lipids including cholesterol. To clear the molecular mechanism of raft formation, several extraction methods were applied to solubilize raft components. Cholesterol extraction using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin was found to be effective to solubilize NAP-22, a neuron-enriched Ca(2+)-dependent calmodulin-binding protein as well as one of the main protein components of brain raft. Purified NAP-22 bound to the liposomes that were made from phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. This binding was dependent on the amount of cholesterol in liposomes. Calmodulin inhibited this binding in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the presence of a calcium-dependent regulatory mechanism works on the assembly of raft within the neuron.

<ABSTRACT>
c-Abl function is strictly dependent on its subcellular localization. Using an in vitro approach, we identify c-Abl as a new substrate for p300, CBP (CREB-binding protein) and PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor) histone acetyltransferases. Remarkably, acetylation markedly alters its subcellular localization. Point mutagenesis indicated that Lys 730, located in the second nuclear localization signal, is the main target of p300 activity. It has previously been reported that c-Abl accumulates in the cytoplasm during myogenic differentiation. Here, we show that c-Abl protein is acetylated at early stages of myogenic differentiation. Indeed, acetylation on Lys 730 drives c-Abl accumulation in the cytoplasm and promotes differentiation. Thus, Lys 730 acetylation is a novel post-translational modification of c-Abl and a novel mechanism for modulating its subcellular localization that contributes to myogenic differentiation.

<ABSTRACT>
Erbin is a member of the LAP (leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and PDZ domain) family. It inhibits Ras-mediated activation of ERK in response to growth factors. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which Erbin regulates the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway. The N-terminal LRR domain was necessary and sufficient to inhibit neuregulin-activated expression of epsilon416-Luc, a reporter of ERK activation. On the other hand, Erbin had no effect on Ras activation, but it attenuated neuregulin-induced Raf activation, suggesting that Erbin may regulate Raf activation by Ras. Via the LRR domain, Erbin interacts with Sur-8, a scaffold protein necessary for the Ras-Raf complex. Expression of Erbin attenuated the interaction of Sur-8 with active Ras and Raf. Moreover, Erbin-shRNA, which suppressed Erbin expression at mRNA and protein levels, increased the interaction of Sur-8 with Ras and Raf, ERK activation, and neuregulin-induced expression of endogenous acetylcholine receptor epsilon-subunit mRNA. These results demonstrate a regulatory role of Erbin in the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway, suggesting that Erbin may inhibit ERK activation by disrupting the Sur-8-Ras/Raf interaction.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are neuronal Na(+) channels that are members of the epithelial Na(+) channel/degenerin family and are transiently activated by extracellular acidification. ASICs in the central nervous system have a modulatory role in synaptic transmission and are involved in cell injury induced by acidosis. We have recently demonstrated that ASIC function is regulated by serine proteases. We provide here evidence that this regulation of ASIC function is tightly linked to channel cleavage. Trypsin cleaves ASIC1a with a similar time course as it changes ASIC1a function, whereas ASIC1b, whose function is not modified by trypsin, is not cleaved. Trypsin cleaves ASIC1a at Arg-145, in the N-terminal part of the extracellular loop, between a highly conserved sequence and a sequence that is critical for ASIC1a inhibition by the venom of the tarantula Psalmopoeus cambridgei. This channel domain controls the inactivation kinetics and co-determines the pH dependence of ASIC gating. It undergoes a conformational change during inactivation, which renders the cleavage site inaccessible to trypsin in inactivated channels.

Roles for APIS and the 20S proteasome in adenovirus E1A-dependent
transcription.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have determined distinct roles for different proteasome complexes in adenovirus (Ad) E1A-dependent transcription. We show that the 19S ATPase, S8, as a component of 19S ATPase proteins independent of 20S (APIS), binds specifically to the E1A transactivation domain, conserved region 3 (CR3). Recruitment of APIS to CR3 enhances the ability of E1A to stimulate transcription from viral early gene promoters during Ad infection of human cells. The ability of CR3 to stimulate transcription in yeast is similarly dependent on the functional integrity of yeast APIS components, Sug1 and Sug2. The 20S proteasome is also recruited to CR3 independently of APIS and the 26S proteasome. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that E1A, S8 and the 20S proteasome are recruited to both Ad early region gene promoters and early region gene sequences during Ad infection, suggesting their requirement in both transcriptional initiation and elongation. We also demonstrate that E1A CR3 transactivation and degradation sequences functionally overlap and that proteasome inhibitors repress E1A transcription. Taken together, these data demonstrate distinct roles for APIS and the 20S proteasome in E1A-dependent transactivation.

Subtelomeric factors antagonize telomere anchoring and Tel1-independent
telomere length regulation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Yeast telomeres are anchored at the nuclear envelope (NE) through redundant pathways that require the telomere-binding factors yKu and Sir4. Significant variation is observed in the efficiency with which different telomeres are anchored, however, suggesting that other forces influence this interaction. Here, we show that subtelomeric elements and the insulator factors that bind them antagonize the association of telomeres with the NE. This is detectable when the redundancy in anchoring pathways is compromised. Remarkably, these same conditions lead to a reduction in steady-state telomere length in the absence of the ATM-kinase homologue Tel1. Both the delocalization of telomeres and reduction in telomere length can be induced by targeting of Tbf1 or Reb1, or the viral transactivator VP16, to a site 23 kb away from the TG repeat. This correlation suggests that telomere anchoring and a Tel1-independent pathway of telomere length regulation are linked, lending a functional significance to the association of yeast telomeres with the NE.

<ABSTRACT>
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the synthesis of chitin is temporally and spatially regulated through the transport of Chs3p (chitin synthase III) to the plasma membrane in the bud neck region. Traffic of Chs3p from the trans-Golgi network (TGN)/early endosome to the plasma membrane requires the function of Chs5p and Chs6p. Chs6p belongs to a family of four proteins that we have named ChAPs for Chs5p-Arf1p-binding Proteins. Here, we show that all ChAPs physically interact not only with Chs5p but also with the small GTPase Arf1p. A short sequence at the C-terminus of the ChAPs is required for protein function and the ability to bind to Chs5p. Simultaneous disruption of two members, Deltabud7 and Deltabch1, phenocopies a Deltachs6 or Deltachs5 deletion with respect to Chs3p transport. Moreover, the ChAPs interact with each other and can form complexes. In addition, they are all at least partially localized to the TGN in a Chs5p-dependent manner. Most importantly, several ChAPs can interact physically with Chs3p. We propose that the ChAPs facilitate export of cargo out of the Golgi.

Overexpression of leucyl aminopeptidase in Plasmodium falciparum
parasites. Target for the antimalarial activity of bestatin.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Malaria aminopeptidases are important in the generation and regulation of free amino acids that are used in protein anabolism and for maintaining osmotic stability within the infected erythrocyte. The intraerythrocytic development of malaria parasites is blocked when the activity of aminopeptidases is specifically inhibited by reagents such as bestatin. One of the major aminopeptidases of malaria parasites is a leucyl aminopeptidase of the M17 family. We reasoned that, when this enzyme was the target of bestatin inhibition, its overexpression in malaria cells would lead to a reduced sensitivity to the inhibitor. To address this supposition, transgenic Plasmodium falciparum parasites overexpressing the leucyl aminopeptidase were generated by transfection with a plasmid that housed the full-length gene. Transgenic parasites expressed a 65-kDa protein close to the predicted molecule size of 67.831 kDa for the introduced leucyl aminopeptidase, and immunofluorescence studies localized the protein to the cytosol, the location of the native enzyme. The product of the transgene was shown to be functionally active with cytosolic extracts of transgenic parasites exhibiting twice the leucyl aminopeptidase activity compared with wild-type parasites. In vitro inhibitor sensitivity assays demonstrated that the transgenic parasites were more resistant to bestatin (EC50 64 microM) compared with the parent parasites (EC50 25 microM). Overexpression of genes in malaria parasites would have general application in the identification and validation of targets for antimalarial drugs.

<ABSTRACT>
Epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) are key events during embryonic development and cancer progression. It has been proposed that Src plays a major role in some EMT models, as shown by the overexpression of viral Src (v-Src) in epithelial cells. It is clear that Src family kinases can regulate the integrity of both adherens junctions and focal adhesions; however, their significance in EMT, especially in the physiological context, remains to be elucidated. Here we showed that Src is activated in transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-mediated EMT in mammary epithelial cells and that the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP1, prevents EMT. However, neither a more specific Src family kinase inhibitor, SU6656, nor a dominant-negative Src inhibited TGF-beta1-mediated EMT, leading us to speculate that Src activation is not an essential component of TGF-beta1-mediated EMT. Unexpectedly, PP1 prevented Smad2/3 activation by TGF-beta1, whereas SU6656 did not. Most interestingly, an in vitro kinase assay showed that PP1 strongly inhibited the TGF-beta receptor type I, and to a lesser extent, the TGF-beta receptor type II. Taken together, our data indicated that PP1 interferes with TGF-beta1-mediated EMT not by inhibiting Src family kinases but by inhibiting the Smad pathway via a direct inhibition of TGF-beta receptor kinase activity.

A secreted type of beta 1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V)

<ABSTRACT>
Angiogenesis is the first regulatory step of tumor progression. Herein, we report on some findings that show that beta1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) functions as an inducer of angiogenesis that has a novel and completely different function from the original function of glycosyltransferase. A secreted type of GnT-V protein itself promoted angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo at physiological concentrations. The highly basic domain of GnT-V induced the release of fibroblast growth factor-2 from heparan sulfate proteoglycan on the cell surface and/or extracellular matrix, leading to angiogenesis. These findings provide some novel information on the relationship between GnT-V and tumor metastasis. The inhibition of GnT-V secretion or its expression represents a novel potential strategy for the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.

Zinc and calcium ions cooperatively modulate ADAMTS13 activity.
</TITLE>

<ABSTRACT>
ADAMTS13 is a metalloproteinase that cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers. The metal ion dependence of ADAMTS13 activity was examined with multimeric VWF and a fluorescent peptide substrate based on Asp(1596)-Arg(1668) of the VWF A2 domain, FRETS-VWF73. ADAMTS13 activity in citrate-anticoagulated plasma was enhanced approximately 2-fold by zinc ions, approximately 3-fold by calcium ions, and approximately 6-fold by both ions, suggesting cooperative activation. Cleavage of VWF by recombinant ADAMTS13 was activated up to approximately 200-fold by zinc ions (K(D) (app) approximately 0.5 microM), calcium ions (K(D) (app) approximately 4.8 microM), and barium ions (K(D) (app) approximately 1.7 mM). Barium ions stimulated ADAMTS13 activity in citrated plasma but not in citrate-free plasma. Therefore, the stimulation by barium ions of ADAMTS13 in citrated plasma appears to reflect the release of chelated calcium and zinc ions from complexes with citrate. At optimal zinc and calcium concentrations, ADAMTS13 cleaved VWF with a K(m) (app) of 3.7 +/- 1.4 microg/ml (approximately 15 nM for VWF subunits), which is comparable with the plasma VWF concentration of 5-10 microg/ml. ADAMTS13 could cleave approximately 14% of VWF pretreated with guanidine HCl, suggesting that this substrate is heterogeneous in susceptibility to proteolysis. ADAMTS13 cleaved FRETS-VWF73 with a K(m) (app) of 3.2 +/- 1.1 microM, consistent with an approximately 200-fold decrease in affinity compared with VWF. ADAMTS13 cleaved VWF and FRETS-VWF73 with roughly comparable catalytic efficiency of 55 microM(-1) min(-1) and 18 microM(-1) min(-1), respectively. The striking preference of ADAMTS13 for VWF suggests that substrate recognition depends on structural features or exosites on multimeric VWF that are missing from FRETS-VWF73.

<ABSTRACT>
Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are vital prosthetic groups for Fe-S proteins involved in fundamental processes such as electron transfer, metabolism, sensing and signaling. In plants, sulfur (SUF) protein-mediated Fe-S cluster biogenesis involves iron acquisition and sulfur mobilization, processes suggested to be plastidic. Here we have shown that AtSufE in Arabidopsis rescues growth defects in SufE-deficient Escherichia coli. In contrast to other SUF proteins, AtSufE localizes to plastids and mitochondria interacting with the plastidic AtSufS and mitochondrial AtNifS1 cysteine desulfurases. AtSufE activates AtSufS and AtNifS1 cysteine desulfurization, and AtSufE activity restoration in either plastids or mitochondria is not sufficient to rescue embryo lethality in AtSufE loss-of-function mutants. AtSufE overexpression induces AtSufS and AtNifS1 expression, which in turn leads to elevated cysteine desulfurization activity, chlorosis and retarded development. Our data demonstrate that plastidic and mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis shares a common, essential component, and that AtSufE acts as an activator of plastidic and mitochondrial desulfurases in Arabidopsis.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The in vitro fidelity of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (HE) is characterized by an unusual propensity for generating (-1)-frameshift mutations. Here we have examined the capability of HE isolated from both a wild-type and a proofreading-impaired mutD5 strain to polymerize from M13mp2 DNA primer-templates containing a terminal T(template).C mismatch. These substrates contained either an A or a G as the next (5') template base. The assay allows distinction between: (i) direct extension of the terminal C (producing a base substitution), (ii) exonucleolytic removal of the C, or (iii), for the G-containing template, extension after misalignment of the C on the next template G (producing a (-1)-frameshift). On the A-containing substrate, both HEs did not extend the terminal C (<1%); instead, they exonucleolytically removed it (>99%). In contrast, on the G-containing substrate, the MutD5 HE yielded 61% (-1)-frameshifts and 6% base substitutions. The wild-type HE mostly excised the mispaired C from this substrate before extension (98%), but among the 2% mutants, (-1)-frameshifts exceeded base substitutions by 20 to 1. The preference of polymerase III HE for misalignment extension over direct mismatch extension provides a basis for explaining the in vitro (-1)-frameshift specificity of polymerase III HE.

Mechanism of activation of NDR (nuclear Dbf2-related) protein kinase by
the hMOB1 protein.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
NDR (nuclear Dbf2-related) kinase belongs to a family of kinases that is highly conserved throughout the eukaryotic world. We showed previously that NDR is regulated by phosphorylation and by the Ca(2+)-binding protein, S100B. The budding yeast relatives of Homo sapiens NDR, Cbk1, and Dbf2, were shown to interact with Mob2 (Mps one binder 2) and Mob1, respectively. This interaction is required for the activity and biological function of these kinases. In this study, we show that hMOB1, the closest relative of yeast Mob1 and Mob2, stimulates NDR kinase activity and interacts with NDR both in vivo and in vitro. The point mutations of highly conserved residues within the N-terminal domain of NDR reduced NDR kinase activity as well as human MOB1 binding. A novel feature of NDR kinases is an insert within the catalytic domain between subdomains VII and VIII. The amino acid sequence within this insert shows a high basic amino acid content in all of the kinases of the NDR family known to interact with MOB proteins. We show that this sequence is autoinhibitory, and our data indicate that the binding of human MOB1 to the N-terminal domain of NDR induces the release of this autoinhibition.

<ABSTRACT>
As part of highly active antiretroviral therapy, protease inhibitor treatment has significantly increased the lifespan of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Many patients, however, develop negative side effects, including premature atherosclerosis. We have previously demonstrated that in male low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) null mice, HIV protease inhibitors induce atherosclerotic lesions and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages in the absence of changes in plasma lipid levels. We determined that these increases were due to an up-regulation of the scavenger receptor, CD36. In the present study, we examined the effects of HIV protease inhibitors in female LDL-R null mice. Female mice given ritonavir and amprenavir (23 and 10 microg/mouse/day, respectively) developed fewer atherosclerotic lesions than males. Furthermore, peritoneal macrophages isolated from ritonavir-treated females had reduced levels of cholesterol accumulation as compared with males, and CD36 protein levels were increased to a significantly lesser degree in females than in males. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of this gender difference, we examined the effect of genetically removing estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha). In female mice lacking both LDL-R and ERalpha, the protective effect of gender was lost. Additionally, the reduced levels of cholesterol accumulation in macrophages observed in females was reversed. Furthermore, the absence of ERalpha resulted in increased expression of CD36 protein in a macrophage-specific manner in mice treated with ritonavir. These data demonstrate that ERalpha is directly involved in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in macrophages and plays an important role in the gender differences observed in HIV protease inhibitor-induced atherosclerosis.

GGA function is required for maturation of neuroendocrine secretory
granules.

<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Secretory granule (SG) maturation has been proposed to involve formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) from immature SGs (ISGs). We tested the effect of inhibiting CCV budding by using the clathrin adaptor GGA (Golgi-associated, gamma-ear-containing, ADP-ribosylation factor-binding protein) on SG maturation in neuroendocrine cells. Overexpression of a truncated, GFP-tagged GGA, VHS (Vps27, Hrs, Stam)-GAT (GGA and target of myb (TOM))-GFP led to retention of MPR, VAMP4, and syntaxin 6 in mature SGs (MSGs), suggesting that CCV budding from ISGs is inhibited by the SG-localizing VHS-GAT-GFP. Furthermore, VHS-GAT-GFP-overexpression disrupts prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) autocatalytic cleavage, processing of secretogranin II to its product p18, and the correlation between PC2 and p18 levels. All these effects were not observed if full-length GGA1-GFP was overexpressed. Neither GGA1-GFP nor VHS-GAT-GFP perturbed SG protein budding from the TGN, or homotypic fusion of ISGs. Reducing GGA3 levels by using short interfering (si)RNA also led to VAMP4 retention in SGs, and inhibition of PC2 activity. Our results suggest that inhibition of CCV budding from ISGs downregulates the sorting from the ISGs and perturbs the intragranular activity of PC2.

Autoregulatory control of the p53 response by caspase-mediated processing

<ABSTRACT>
The serine/threonine kinase HIPK2 phosphorylates the p53 protein at Ser 46, thus promoting p53-dependent gene expression and subsequent apoptosis. Here, we show that DNA damaging chemotherapeutic drugs cause degradation of endogenous HIPK2 dependent on the presence of a functional p53 protein. Early induced p53 allows caspase-mediated cleavage of HIPK2 following aspartic acids 916 and 977. The resulting C-terminally truncated HIPK2 forms show an enhanced induction of the p53 response and cell death, thus allowing the rapid amplification of the p53-dependent apoptotic program during the initiation phase of apoptosis by a regulatory feed-forward loop. The active HIPK2 fragments are further degraded during the execution and termination phase of apoptosis, thus ensuring the occurrence of HIPK2 signaling only during the early phases of apoptosis induction.

Localization of TLR2 and MyD88 to Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions.
Evidence for signaling by intracellular TLR2 during infection with an
obligate intracellular pathogen.

<ABSTRACT>
Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular gram-negative pathogen and the etiologic agent of significant ocular and genital tract diseases. Chlamydiae primarily infect epithelial cells, and the inflammatory response of these cells to the infection directs both the innate and adaptive immune response. This study focused on determining the cellular immune receptors involved in the early events following infection with the L2 serovar of C. trachomatis.We found that dominant negative MyD88 inhibited interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion during a productive infection with chlamydia. Furthermore, expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 was required for IL-8 secretion from infected cells, whereas the effect of TLR4/MD-2 expression was minimal. Cell activation was dependent on infection with live, replicating bacteria, because infection with UV-irradiated bacteria and treatment of infected cells with chloramphenicol, but not ampicillin, abrogated the induction of IL-8 secretion. Finally, we show that both TLR2 and MyD88 co-localize with the intracellular chlamydial inclusion, suggesting that TLR2 is actively engaged in signaling from this intracellular location. These data support the role of TLR2 in the host response to infection with C. trachomatis. Our data further demonstrate that TLR2 and the adaptor MyD88 are specifically recruited to the bacterial or inclusion membrane during a productive infection with chlamydia and provide the first evidence that intracellular TLR2 is responsible for signal transduction during infection with an intracellular bacterium.

<ABSTRACT>
The study of free-living amoebae has proven valuable to explain the molecular mechanisms controlling phagocytosis, cell adhesion and motility. In this study, we identified a new adhesion molecule in Dictyostelium amoebae. The SibA (Similar to Integrin Beta) protein is a type I transmembrane protein, and its cytosolic, transmembrane and extracellular domains contain features also found in integrin beta chains. In addition, the conserved cytosolic domain of SibA interacts with talin, a well-characterized partner of mammalian integrins. Finally, genetic inactivation of SIBA affects adhesion to phagocytic particles, as well as cell adhesion and spreading on its substrate. It does not visibly alter the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, cellular migration or multicellular development. Our results indicate that the SibA protein is a Dictyostelium cell adhesion molecule presenting structural and functional similarities to metazoan integrin beta chains. This study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms controlling cell adhesion and their establishment during evolution.

<ABSTRACT>
Human C4b-binding protein (C4BP) protects host tissue, and those pathogens able to hijack this plasma glycoprotein, from complement-mediated destruction. We now show that the first two complement control protein (CCP) modules of the C4BP alpha-chain, plus the four residues connecting them, are necessary and sufficient for binding a bacterial virulence factor, the Streptococcus pyogenes M4 (Arp4) protein. Structure determination by NMR reveals two tightly coupled CCP modules in an elongated arrangement within this region of C4BP. Chemical shift perturbation studies demonstrate that the N-terminal, hypervariable region of M4 binds to a site including strand 1 of CCP module 2. This interaction is accompanied by an intermodular reorientation within C4BP. We thus provide a detailed picture of an interaction whereby a pathogen evades complement.

Maintenance of plastid RNA editing activities independently of their

<ABSTRACT>
RNA editing in plant organelles is mediated by site-specific, nuclear-encoded factors. Previous data suggested that the maintenance of these factors depends on the presence of their rapidly evolving cognate sites. The surprising ability of allotetraploid Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) to edit a foreign site in the chloroplast ndhA messenger RNA was thought to be inherited from its diploid male ancestor, Nicotiana tomentosiformis. Here, we show that the same ndhA editing activity is also present in Nicotiana sylvestris, which is the female diploid progenitor of tobacco and which lacks the ndhA site. Hence, heterologous editing is not simply a result of tobacco's allopolyploid genome organization. Analyses of other editing sites after sexual or somatic transfer between land plants showed that heterologous editing occurs at a surprisingly high frequency. This suggests that the corresponding editing activities are conserved despite the absence of their target sites, potentially because they serve other functions in the plant cell.

hypothalamus of the rat.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The cytokine IL-1 mediates diverse forms of neurodegeneration, but its mechanism of action is unknown. We have demonstrated previously that exogenous and endogenous IL-1 acts specifically in the rat striatum to dramatically enhance ischemic and excitotoxic brain damage and cause extensive cortical injury. Here we tested the hypothesis that this distant effect of IL-1 is mediated through polysynaptic striatal outputs to the cortex via the hypothalamus. We show that IL-1beta injected into the rat striatum with the excitotoxin alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (S-AMPA) caused increased expression of IL-1beta (mRNA and protein) mainly in the cortex where maximum injury occurs. Marked increases in IL-1beta mRNA and protein were also observed in the hypothalamus. S-AMPA, injected alone into the striatum, caused only localized damage, but administration of IL-1beta into either the striatum or the lateral hypothalamus immediately after striatal S-AMPA resulted in widespread cell loss throughout the ipsilateral cortex. Finally we showed that the cortical cell death produced by striatal coinjection of S-AMPA and IL-1beta was significantly reduced by administration of the IL-1 receptor antagonist into the lateral hypothalamus. These data suggest that IL-1beta can act in the hypothalamus to modify cell viability in the cortex. We conclude that IL-1-dependent pathways project from the striatum to the cortex via the hypothalamus and lead to cortical injury, and that these may contribute to a number of human neurological conditions including stroke and head trauma.

<ABSTRACT>
Deletions of chromosome 6 are a common abnormality in diverse human malignancies including astrocytic tumours, suggesting the presence of tumour suppressor genes (TSG). In order to help identify candidate TSGs, we have constructed a chromosome 6 tile path microarray. The array contains 1,780 clones (778 P1-derived artificial chromosome and 1,002 bacterial artificial chromosome) that cover 98.3% of the published chromosome 6 sequences. A total of 104 adult astrocytic tumours (10 diffuse astrocytomas, 30 anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), 64 glioblastomas (GB)) were analysed using this array. Single copy number change was successfully detected and the result was in general concordant with a microsatellite analysis. The pattern of copy number change was complex with multiple interstitial deletions/gains. However, a predominance of telomeric 6q deletions was seen. Two small common and overlapping regions of deletion at 6q26 were identified. One was 1,002 kb in size and contained PACRG and QKI, while the second was 199 kb and harbours a single gene, ARID1B. The data show that the chromosome 6 tile path array is useful in mapping copy number changes with high resolution and accuracy. We confirmed the high frequency of chromosome 6 deletions in AA and GB, and identified two novel commonly deleted regions that may harbour TSGs.

<ABSTRACT>
In yeast, phosphatidylethanolamine is a target of the Atg8 modifier in ubiquitylation-like reactions essential for autophagy. Three human Atg8 (hAtg8) homologs, LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16, have been characterized as modifiers in reactions mediated by hAtg7 (an E1-like enzyme) and hAtg3 (an E2-like enzyme) as in yeast Atg8 lipidation, but their final targets have not been identified. The results of a recent study in which COS7 cells were incubated with [14C]ethanolamine for 48 h suggested that phosphatidylethanolamine is a target of LC3. However, these results were not conclusive because of the long incubation time. To identify the phospholipid targets of Atg8 homologs, we reconstituted conjugation systems for mammalian Atg8 homologs in vitro using purified recombinant Atg proteins and liposomes. Each purified mutant Atg8 homolog with an exposed C-terminal Gly formed an E1-substrate intermediate with hAtg7 via a thioester bond in an ATP-dependent manner and formed an E2-substrate intermediate with hAtg3 via a thioester bond dependent on ATP and hAtg7. A conjugated form of each Atg8 homolog was observed in the presence of hAtg7, hAtg3, ATP, and liposomes. In addition to phosphatidylethanolamine, in vitro conjugation experiments using synthetic phospholipid liposomes showed that phosphatidylserine is also a target of LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16. In contrast, thin layer chromatography of phospholipids released on hAtg4B-digestion from endogenous LC3-phospholipid conjugate revealed that phosphatidylethanolamine, but not phosphatidylserine, is the predominant target phospholipid of LC3 in vivo. The discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo reactions suggested that there may be selective factor(s) involved in the endogenous LC3 conjugation system.

G-protein-coupled receptor agonists activate endogenous phospholipase
Cepsilon and phospholipase Cbeta3 in a temporally distinct manner.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Phospholipase Cepsilon (PLCepsilon) is one of the newest members of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) family. Previous studies have suggested that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis by activating PLCbeta isoforms through G(q) family G proteins and Gbetagamma subunits. Using RNA interference to knock down PLC isoforms, we demonstrate that the GPCR agonists endothelin (ET-1), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and thrombin, acting through endogenous receptors, couple to both endogenous PLCepsilon and the PLCbeta isoform, PLCbeta3, in Rat-1 fibroblasts. Examination of the temporal activation of these PLC isoforms, however, reveals agonist- and isoform-specific profiles. PLCbeta3 is activated acutely within the first minute of ET-1, LPA, or thrombin stimulation but does not contribute to sustained PI hydrolysis induced by LPA or thrombin and accounts for only part of ET-1 sustained stimulation. PLCepsilon, on the other hand, predominantly accounts for sustained PI hydrolysis. Consistent with this observation, reconstitution of PLCepsilon in knockdown cells dose-dependently increases sustained, but not acute, agonist-stimulated PI hydrolysis. Furthermore, combined knockdown of both PLCepsilon and PLCbeta3 additively inhibits PI hydrolysis, suggesting independent regulation of each isoform. Importantly, ubiquitination of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors correlates with sustained, but not acute, activation of PLCepsilon or PLCbeta3. In conclusion, GPCR agonists ET-1, LPA, and thrombin activate endogenous PLCepsilon and PLCbeta3 in Rat-1 fibroblasts. Activation of these PLC isoforms displays agonist-specific temporal profiles; however, PLCbeta3 is predominantly involved in acute and PLCepsilon in sustained PI hydrolysis.

<ABSTRACT>
The matrix protein (MA) of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) was found to interact with IQGAP1, a prominent regulator of the cytoskeleton. Mutational studies defined residues of MA critical for the interaction, and tests of viruses carrying MA mutations revealed a near-perfect correlation between binding and virus replication. The replication-defective mutants showed defects in both early and late stages of the life cycle. Four viable second-site revertant viruses were isolated from three different replication-defective parental mutants, and in all cases the interaction with IQGAP1 was restored by the suppressor mutations. The interaction of MA and IQGAP1 was readily detected in vitro and in vivo. Virus replication was potently inhibited by a C-terminal fragment of IQGAP1, and impaired by RNAi knockdown of IQGAP1 and 2. We suggest that the IQGAPs link the virus to the cytoskeleton for trafficking both into and out of the cell.

<ABSTRACT>
The heterodimeric ABC transporter TAP translocates proteasomal degradation products from the cytosol into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where these peptides are loaded onto MHC class I molecules by a macromolecular peptide-loading complex (PLC) and subsequently shuttled to the cell surface for inspection by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Tapasin recruits, as a central adapter protein, other components of the PLC at the unique N-terminal domains of TAP. We found that the N-terminal domains of human TAP1 and TAP2 can independently bind to tapasin, thus providing two separate loading platforms for PLC assembly. Moreover, tapasin binding is dependent on the first N-terminal transmembrane helix of TAP1 and TAP2, demonstrating that these two helices contribute independently to the recruitment of tapasin and associated factors.

<ABSTRACT>
The objective of this study was to identify proteins modified with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) in pancreatic beta-cells and to understand their roles in cell death under hyperglycemic conditions. Here we report that heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) is modified with O-GlcNAc. Levels of O-GlcNAcylated HSP60 increased twofold in response to hyperglycemic conditions. HSP60 is a chaperonin known to bind to Bax in the cytoplasm under normoglycemic conditions. Under hyperglycemic conditions, Bax detached from O-GlcNAcylated HSP60 and translocated to mitochondria. Hyperglycemic conditions were also associated with cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and cell death, suggesting that elevated O-GlcNAcylation of HSP60 interferes with HSP60-Bax interactions, leading to pancreatic beta-cell death.

Structural insights into the mechanism and inhibition of eukaryotic

<ABSTRACT>
O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification of specific serines/threonines on intracellular proteins in higher eukaryotes has been shown to directly regulate important processes such as the cell cycle, insulin sensitivity and transcription. The structure, molecular mechanisms of catalysis, protein substrate recognition/specificity of the eukaryotic O-GlcNAc transferase and hydrolase are largely unknown. Here we describe the crystal structure, enzymology and in vitro activity on human substrates of Clostridium perfringens NagJ, a close homologue of human O-GlcNAcase (OGA), representing the first family 84 glycoside hydrolase structure. The structure reveals a deep active site pocket highly conserved with the human enzyme, compatible with binding of O-GlcNAcylated peptides. Together with mutagenesis data, the structure supports a variant of the substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism, involving two aspartic acids and an unusually positioned tyrosine. Insights into recognition of substrate come from a complex with the transition state mimic O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (Ki=5.4 nM). Strikingly, the enzyme is inhibited by the pseudosubstrate peptide Ala-Cys(-S-GlcNAc)-Ala, and has OGA activity against O-GlcNAcylated human proteins, suggesting that the enzyme is a suitable model for further studies into the function of human OGA.

Interaction of p27 with E1A and its effect on CDK kinase activity.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The interaction of p27 with adenovirus (Ad) E1A was investigated to study its possible role in cell-cycle regulation and transformation by E1A. In in vitro binding assays, recombinant p27 proteins were shown to bind 12S and 13S E1A products of both Ad12 and Ad5. The amino-terminal region of p27, but not the carboxyl-terminal region, was responsible for the E1A binding. In the Ad12 E1A proteins, the C-terminal region showed relative importance in p27 binding. Phosphorylation of histone H1 or E1A proteins by CDK2 complex was inhibited by p27, but, in contrast, p27 stimulated the phosphorylation of E1A proteins by CDK4. Thus, the interaction of p27 and E1A proteins may modulate the function of E1A in cell-cycle control by regulating E1A phosphorylation.

Wolfram syndrome-associated mutations lead to instability and proteasomal
degradation of wolframin.

<ABSTRACT>
Wolfram syndrome is caused by mutations in WFS1 encoding wolframin, a polytopic membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we investigated the molecular pathomechanisms of four missense and two truncating mutations in WFS1. Expression in COS-7 cells as well as direct analysis of patient cells revealed that WFS1 mutations lead to drastically reduced steady-state levels of wolframin. All mutations resulted in highly unstable proteins which were delivered to proteasomal degradation. No wolframin aggregates were found in patient cells suggesting that Wolfram syndrome is not a disease of protein aggregation. Rather, WFS1 mutations cause loss-of-function by cellular depletion of wolframin.

We report for the first time the identification of 25 microRNAs from tissues originating from chicken embryo and adult chicken. Most of the cloned microRNAs are expressed in both adult chickens and chicken embryos. Fourteen were identified without any prior prediction. One microRNA, miR-757, is thought to be chicken-specific. Three of the microRNAs appear to be extremely tissue specific.

Assessment of structural and functional divergence far from the large
subunit active site of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase.

NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Despite conservation of three-dimensional structure and active-site residues, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco, EC 4.1.1.39) enzymes from divergent species differ with respect to catalytic efficiency and CO2/O2 specificity. A deeper understanding of the structural basis for these differences may provide a rationale for engineering an improved enzyme, thereby leading to an increase in photosynthetic CO2 fixation and agricultural productivity. By comparing 500 active-site large subunit sequences from flowering plants with that of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a small number of residues were found to differ in regions previously shown by mutant screening to influence CO2/O2 specificity. When directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation were used to change Chlamydomonas Met-42 and Cys-53 to land plant Val-42 and Ala-53 in the large subunit N-terminal domain, little or no change in Rubisco catalytic properties was observed. However, changing Chlamydomonas methyl-Cys-256, Lys-258, and Ile-265 to land plant Phe-256, Arg-258, and Val-265 at the bottom of the alpha/beta-barrel active site caused a 10% decrease in CO2/O2 specificity, largely due to an 85% decrease in carboxylation catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km). Because land plant Rubisco enzymes have greater CO2/O2 specificity than the Chlamydomonas enzyme, this group of residues must be complemented by other residues that differ between Chlamydomonas and land plants. The Rubisco x-ray crystal structures indicate that these residues may reside in a variable loop of the nuclear-encoded small subunit, more than 20 A away from the active site.

A conserved pathway to activate BRCA1-dependent ubiquitylation at DNA
damage sites.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The BRCA1 tumour suppressor and its heterodimeric partner BARD1 constitute an E3-ubiquitin (Ub) ligase and function in DNA repair by unknown mechanisms. We show here that the Caenorhabditis elegans BRCA1/BARD1 (CeBCD) complex possesses an E3-Ub ligase responsible for ubiquitylation at DNA damage sites following ionizing radiation (IR). The DNA damage checkpoint promotes the association of the CeBCD complex with E2-Ub conjugating enzyme, Ubc5(LET-70), leading to the formation of an active E3-Ub ligase on chromatin following IR. Correspondingly, defects in Ubc5(let-70) or the DNA damage checkpoint genes atl-1 or mre-11 abolish CeBCD-dependent ubiquitylation in vivo. Extending these findings to human cells reveals a requirement for UbcH5c, the MRN complex, gamma-H2AX and a co-dependence for ATM and ATR kinases for BRCA1-dependent ubiquitylation at DNA damage sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DNA damage checkpoint promotes the association between BRCA1 and UbcH5c to form an active E3-Ub ligase on chromatin after IR. These data reveal that BRCA1-dependent ubiquitylation is activated at sites of DNA repair by the checkpoint as part of a conserved DNA damage response.

An anchored PKA and PDE4 complex regulates subplasmalemmal cAMP dynamics.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The spatiotemporal regulation of cAMP can generate microdomains just beneath the plasma membrane where cAMP increases are larger and more dynamic than those seen globally. Real-time measurements of cAMP using mutant cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel biosensors, pharmacological tools and RNA interference (RNAi) were employed to demonstrate a subplasmalemmal cAMP signaling module in living cells. Transient cAMP increases were observed upon stimulation of HEK293 cells with prostaglandin E1. However, pretreatment with selective inhibitors of type 4 phosphodiesterases (PDE4), protein kinase A (PKA) or PKA/A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) interaction blocked an immediate return of subplasmalemmal cAMP to basal levels. Knockdown of specific membrane-associated AKAPs using RNAi identified gravin (AKAP250) as the central organizer of the PDE4 complex. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that gravin maintains a signaling complex that includes PKA and PDE4D. We propose that gravin-associated PDE4D isoforms provide a means to rapidly terminate subplasmalemmal cAMP signals with concomitant effects on localized ion channels or enzyme activities.

<ABSTRACT>
LATS2 is a human homolog of Drosophila tumor suppressor lats/warts, and encodes a mitotic kinase whose physiological roles remain to be elucidated. We performed yeast two-hybrid screening and identified a LIM protein Ajuba, as a binding partner of LATS2. LATS2 was localized to the centrosomes throughout the cell cycle and was associated with Ajuba during mitosis, contributing to latter's mitotic phosphorylation. Depletion of LATS2 or Ajuba impaired centrosomal accumulation of gamma-tubulin and spindle formation at the onset of mitosis, suggesting that the LATS2-Ajuba complex regulates organization of the spindle apparatus through recruitment of gamma-tubulin to the centrosome.

<ABSTRACT>
Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by systemic extracellular deposition of transthyretin (TTR) amyloid fibrils. The latter have been proposed to trigger neurodegeneration through engagement of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Here we show that TTR interaction with RAGE is conserved across mouse and human species and is not dependent on RAGE glycosylation. Moreover, strand D of TTR structure seems important for the TTR-RAGE interaction as well as a motif in RAGE (residues 102-118) located within the V-domain; this motif suppressed TTR aggregate-induced cytotoxicity in cell culture.

<ABSTRACT>
Aminoacylation of tRNA is the first step of protein synthesis. Here, we report the co-crystal structure of human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase and tRNATrp. This enzyme is reported to interact directly with elongation factor 1alpha, which carries charged tRNA to the ribosome. Crystals were generated from a 50/50% mixture of charged and uncharged tRNATrp. These crystals captured two conformations of the complex, which are nearly identical with respect to the protein and a bound tryptophan. They are distinguished by the way tRNA is bound. In one, uncharged tRNA is bound across the dimer, with anticodon and acceptor stem interacting with separate subunits. In this cross-dimer tRNA complex, the class I enzyme has a class II-like tRNA binding mode. This structure accounts for biochemical investigations of human TrpRS, including species-specific charging. In the other conformation, presumptive aminoacylated tRNA is bound only by the anticodon, the acceptor stem being free and having space to interact precisely with EF-1alpha, suggesting that the product of aminoacylation can be directly handed off to EF-1alpha for the next step of protein synthesis.

<ABSTRACT>
Streptococcus pneumoniae expresses two surface-exposed lipoproteins, PpmA and SlrA, which share homology with distinct families of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases). In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that the lipoprotein cyclophilin, SlrA, can catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of proline containing tetrapeptides and that SlrA contributes to pneumococcal colonization. The substrate specificity of SlrA is typical for prokaryotic and eukaryotic cyclophilins, with Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (pNA) being the most rapidly catalyzed substrate. In a mouse pneumonia model the slrA knock-out D39DeltaslrA did not cause significant differences in the survival times of mice compared with the isogenic wild-type strain. In contrast, a detailed analysis of bacterial outgrowth over time in the nasopharynx, airways, lungs, blood, and spleen showed a rapid elimination of slrA mutants from the upper airways but did not reveal significant differences in the lungs, blood, and spleen. These results suggested that SlrA is involved in colonization but does not contribute significantly to invasive pneumococcal disease. In cell culture infection experiments, the absence of SlrA impaired adherence to pneumococcal disease-specific epithelial and endothelial non-professional cell lines. Adherence of the slrA mutant could not be restored by exogenously added SlrA. Strikingly, deficiency in SlrA did not reduce binding activity to host target proteins, but resulted in enhanced uptake by professional phagocytes. In conclusion, SlrA is a functional, cyclophilin-type PPIase and contributes to pneumococcal virulence in the first stage of infection, namely, colonization of the upper airways, most likely by modulating the biological function of important virulence proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Eg5 or KSP is a homotetrameric Kinesin-5 involved in centrosome separation and assembly of the bipolar mitotic spindle. Analytical gel filtration of purified protein and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of unidirectional shadowed microtubule-Eg5 complexes have been used to identify the stable dimer Eg5-513. The motility assays show that Eg5-513 promotes robust plus-end-directed microtubule gliding at a rate similar to that of homotetrameric Eg5 in vitro. Eg5-513 exhibits slow ATP turnover, high affinity for ATP, and a weakened affinity for microtubules when compared to monomeric Eg5. We show here that the Eg5-513 dimer binds microtubules with both heads to two adjacent tubulin heterodimers along the same microtubule protofilament. Under all nucleotide conditions tested, there were no visible structural changes in the monomeric Eg5-microtubule complexes with monastrol treatment. In contrast, there was a substantial monastrol effect on dimeric Eg5-513, which reduced microtubule lattice decoration. Comparisons between the X-ray structures of Eg5-ADP and Eg5-ADP-monastrol with rat kinesin-ADP after docking them into cryo-EM 3-D scaffolds revealed structural evidence for the weaker microtubule-Eg5 interaction in the presence of monastrol.

<ABSTRACT>
The presence of d-amino-acid-containing polypeptides, defensin-like peptide (DLP)-2 and Ornithorhyncus venom C-type natriuretic peptide (OvCNP)b, in platypus venom suggested the existence of a mammalian d-amino-acid-residue isomerase(s) responsible for the modification of the all-l-amino acid precursors. We show here that this enzyme(s) is present in the venom gland extract and is responsible for the creation of DLP-2 from DLP-4 and OvCNPb from OvCNPa. The isomerisation reaction is freely reversible and under well defined laboratory conditions catalyses the interconversion of the DLPs to full equilibration. The isomerase is approximately 50-60 kDa and is inhibited by methanol and the peptidase inhibitor amastatin. This is the first known l-to-d-amino-acid-residue isomerase in a mammal.

<ABSTRACT>
The E2F family is composed of at least eight E2F and two DP subunits, which in cells exist as E2F/DP heterodimers that bind to and regulate E2F target genes. While DP-1 is an essential and widespread component of E2F, much less is known about the DP-3 subunit, which exists as a number of distinct protein isoforms that differ in several respects including the presence of a nuclear localisation signal (NLS). We show here that the NLS region of DP-3 harbours a binding site for 14-3-3epsilon, and that binding of 14-3-3epsilon alters the cell cycle and apoptotic properties of E2F. DP-3 responds to DNA damage, and the interaction between DP-3 and 14-3-3epsilon is under DNA damage-responsive control. Further, 14-3-3epsilon is present in the promoter region of certain E2F target genes, and reducing 14-3-3epsilon levels induces apoptosis. These results identify a new level of control on E2F activity and, at a more general level, suggest that 14-3-3 proteins integrate E2F activity with the DNA damage response.

Allele-specific methylation analysis on upstream promoter region of H19 by

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
H19 and IGF2 genes are imprinted genes and expressed differently depending on whether they are carried by a chromosome of maternal or paternal origin; H19 is expressed only from the maternal allele and IGF2 only from the paternally inherited allele. The upstream promoter region of H19 has the imprinting-control region (ICR) or CTCF binding sites, where the methylation status of this region is critical to the regulation of imprinting of the H19/IGF2 locus located in chromosome 11p15. There are various reports on imprinting disorders in this region. In colorectal cancer aberrant biallelic methylation of CTCF binding site has been reported, and aberrant hypomethylation of this region in bladder cancer. Thus, certain human neoplasms have either hyper- or hypo-methylation in the ICR. Hence it is still difficult to analyze allele-specific methylation disorder of the region, or differentially methylated regions (DMR), locate upstream of H19. Here we report a new method, which could distinguish paternal epigenetic or maternal epigenetic pattern by a single PCR assay, to combine methylation-specific PCR and PCR with confronting two-pair primers (MSP-CTPP). Using this method, we investigated the region close to H19 ICR in 161 colorectal cancer and 65 gastric cancer cases.

A hyper-dynamic equilibrium between promoter-bound and nucleoplasmic

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Because of its very high affinity for DNA, NF-kappaB is believed to make long-lasting contacts with cognate sites and to be essential for the nucleation of very stable enhanceosomes. However, the kinetic properties of NF-kappaB interaction with cognate sites in vivo are unknown. Here, we show that in living cells NF-kappaB is immobilized onto high-affinity binding sites only transiently, and that complete NF-kappaB turnover on active chromatin occurs in less than 30 s. Therefore, promoter-bound NF-kappaB is in dynamic equilibrium with nucleoplasmic dimers; promoter occupancy and transcriptional activity oscillate synchronously with nucleoplasmic NF-kappaB and independently of promoter occupancy by other sequence-specific transcription factors. These data indicate that changes in the nuclear concentration of NF-kappaB directly impact on promoter function and that promoters sample nucleoplasmic levels of NF-kappaB over a timescale of seconds, thus rapidly re-tuning their activity. We propose a revision of the enhanceosome concept in this dynamic framework.

Two distinct but interchangeable mechanisms for flipping of lipid-linked
oligosaccharides.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Translocation of lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) intermediates across membranes is an essential but poorly understood process in eukaryotic and bacterial glycosylation pathways. Membrane proteins defined as translocases or flippases are implicated to mediate the translocation reaction. The membrane protein Wzx has been proposed to mediate the translocation across the plasma membrane of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O antigen subunits, which are assembled on an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate lipid carrier. Similarly, PglK (formerly WlaB) is a Campylobacter jejuni-encoded ABC-type transporter proposed to mediate the translocation of the undecaprenylpyrophosphate-linked heptasaccharide intermediate involved in the recently identified bacterial N-linked protein glycosylation pathway. A combination of genetic and carbohydrate structural analyses defined and characterized flippase activities in the C. jejuni N-linked protein glycosylation and the Escherichia coli LPS O antigen biosynthesis. PglK displayed relaxed substrate specificity with respect to the oligosaccharide structure of the LLO intermediate and complemented a wzx deficiency in E. coli O-antigen biosynthesis. Our experiments provide strong genetic evidence that LLO translocation across membranes can be catalyzed by two distinct proteins that do not share any sequence similarity.

Wnt pathway mutations selected by optimal beta-catenin signaling for
tumorigenesis.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Mutations in components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway are observed to be the earliest initiating event for most colorectal tumors. The majority of the mutations occur in the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), even though there are other genes that are capable of modulating the pathway activity. Moreover, the specific APC mutations associated in colon cancer indicate the possibility that the tumor selects for certain truncated forms of APC that partially retain its function, namely, inhibition of beta-catenin. We estimated the effects of various mutations in APC and other known mutations using a recent mathematical model of the Wnt pathway that was constructed to represent the conserved core molecular events. We provide evidence that APC mutations are selected not based on the maximal level of beta-catenin but rather based on distinct state of activity that appears to be optimal for the tissue-specific tumorigenesis. This optimal level is determined by balancing beta-catenin signaling and the induction of Axin2 that acts as a potent negative feedback. The predominant pattern of APC mutations may provide synergistic oncogenic effects that promote colorectal tumorigenesis: the optimal signaling for cell survival and renewal, disrupted cell adhesion, chromosomal instability, and altered asymmetric division of stem cells.

Involvement of calcineurin-dependent degradation of Yap1p in Ca2+-induced
G2 cell-cycle regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Ca2+-activated pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae induce a delay in the onset of mitosis through the activation of Swe1p, a negative regulatory kinase that inhibits the Cdc28p/Clb complex. We isolated the YAP1 gene as a multicopy suppressor of calcium sensitivity owing to the loss of ZDS1, a negative regulator of SWE1 and CLN2 gene expression. YAP1 deletion on a zds1delta background exacerbated the Ca2+-related phenotype. Yap1p was degraded in a calcineurin-dependent manner when cells were exposed to calcium. In yap1delta cells, the expression level of the RPN4 gene encoding a transcription factor for the subunits of the ubiquitin-proteasome system was diminished. The deletion of YAP1 gene or RPN4 gene led to the accumulation of Swe1p and Cln2p. Yap1p was a substrate of calcineurin in vivo and in vitro. The calcineurin-mediated Yap1p degradation seems to be a long adaptive response that assures a G2 delay in response to a stress that causes the activation of the calcium signalling pathways.

<ABSTRACT>
Two of the unanswered questions in mammalian developmental biology are when and where the fate of the germ cell is specified. Here, we report that stem cells isolated from the skin of porcine fetuses have the intrinsic ability to differentiate into oocyte-like cells. When differentiation was induced, a subpopulation of these cells expressed markers such as Oct4, Growth differentiation factor 9b (GDF9b), the Deleted in Azoospermia-like (DAZL) gene and Vasa - all consistent with germ-cell formation. On further differentiation, these cells formed follicle-like aggregates that secreted oestradiol and progesterone and responded to gonadotropin stimulation. Some of these aggregates extruded large oocyte-like cells that expressed oocyte markers, such as zona pellucida, and the meiosis marker, synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SCP3). Some of these oocyte-like cells spontaneously developed into parthenogenetic embryo-like structures. The ability to generate oocyte-like cells from skin-derived cells may offer new possibilities for tissue therapy and provide a new in vitro model to study germ-cell formation and oogenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
The polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) is a 58 kDa protein involved in many aspects of RNA metabolism. In this study, we focused our attention on the structure of the two C-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRM3 and RRM4) of PTB. In a previous study, it was found that the two RRMs are independent in the free state. We recently determined the structure of the same fragment in complex with RNA and found that the two RRMs interact extensively. This difference made us re-evaluate in detail the free protein structure and in particular the interdomain interface. We used a combination of NMR spectroscopy and segmental isotopic labeling to unambiguously study and characterize the interdomain interactions. An improved segmental isotopic labeling protocol was used, enabling us to unambiguously identify 130 interdomain NOEs between the two RRMs and to calculate a very precise structure. The structure reveals a large interdomain interface, resulting in a very unusual positioning of the two RRM domains relative to one another.

Characterization of rapidly degraded polypeptides in mammalian cells

<ABSTRACT>
Approximately 30% of polypeptides synthesized by mammalian cells are degraded with a half-life of <10 min by proteasomes. These rapidly degraded polypeptides (RDPs) constitute the bulk of proteasome substrates and are the principal source of viral and self-peptide ligands for major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. Here we provide evidence that approximately 75% of RDPs are degraded by the standard ubiquitin 26 S proteasome system and that their degradation is regulated by modulating Hsc70 activity in cells. Surprisingly, the remaining approximately 25% of RDPs are degraded without ubiquitylation by 20 S proteasomes independently of 19 S regulators and in a manner that is largely unaffected by modulating Hsc70 activity. This latter pathway is utilized for generating an antigenic peptide from viral-defective ribosomal products. The dichotomy in the behavior of RDPs points to a novel quality control level for nascent proteins that is independent of the well established Hsc70-ubiquitin 26 S proteasome pathway.

<ABSTRACT>
The adrenal gland protein AD-004 like protein (ADLP) from Caenorhabditis elegans was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Enzyme assays showed that ADLP has special adenylate kinase (AK) properties, with ATP and dATP as the preferred phosphate donors. In contrast to all other AK isoforms, AMP and dAMP were the preferred substrates of ADLP; CMP, TMP and shikimate acid were also good substrates. Subcellular localization studies showed a predominant nuclear localization for this protein, which is different from AK1-AK5, but similar to that of human AK6. These results suggest that ADLP is more likely a member of the AK6 family. Furthermore, RNAi experiments targeting ADLP were conducted and showed that RNAi treatment resulted in the suppression of worm growth.

<ABSTRACT>
DNA CpG methylation can cooperate with histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) methylation in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing. Trimethylation of H3-K9 by the recently identified euchromatic histone methyltransferase SETDB1/ESET may be responsible for transcriptional repression of certain promoters. Here, we show that SETDB1 associates with endogenous DNA methyltransferase activity. SETDB1 interacts with the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B but not with the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1. The interaction of SETDB1 with DNMT3A was further characterized and confirmed by in vivo and in vitro interaction studies. A direct interaction of the two proteins occurs through the N terminus of SETDB1 and the plant homeodomain of DNMT3A. Co-expression of SETDB1 and DNMT3A was essential for repression of reporter gene expression in a Gal4-based tethering assay and resulted in their recruitment to the artificial promoter. We further demonstrate that the CpG-methylated promoters of the endogenous p53BP2 gene in HeLa cells and the RASSF1A gene in MDA-MB-231 cells are simultaneously occupied by both SETDB1 and DNMT3A proteins, which provides evidence for SETDB1 being at least partly responsible for H3-K9 trimethylation at the promoter of RASSF1A, a gene frequently silenced in human cancers. In summary, our data demonstrate the direct physical interaction and functional connection between the H3-K9 trimethylase SETDB1 and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and thus contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of the self-reinforcing heterochromatin machinery operating at silenced promoters.

Mae inhibits Pointed-P2 transcriptional activity by blocking its MAPK
docking site.
</TITLE>

<ABSTRACT>
During Drosophila melanogaster eye development, signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) leads to activation of a mitogen activated protein tyrosine kinase, called Rolled. Key nuclear targets of Rolled are two antagonistic transcription factors: Yan, a repressor, and Pointed-P2 (Pnt-P2), an activator. A critical regulator of this process, Mae, can interact with both Yan and Pnt-P2 through their SAM domains. Although earlier work showed that Mae derepresses Yan-regulated transcription by depolymerizing the Yan polymer, the mechanism of Pnt-P2 regulation by Mae remained undefined. We find that efficient phosphorylation and consequent activation of Pnt-P2 requires a three-dimensional docking surface on its SAM domain for the MAP kinase, Rolled. Mae binding to Pnt-P2 occludes this docking surface, thereby acting to downregulate Pnt-P2 activity. Docking site blocking provides a new mechanism whereby the cell can precisely modulate kinase signaling at specific targets, providing another layer of regulation beyond the more global changes effected by alterations in the activity of the kinase itself.

An NRSF/REST-like repressor downstream of Ebi/SMRTER/Su(H) regulates eye
development in Drosophila.

<ABSTRACT>
The corepressor complex that includes Ebi and SMRTER is a target of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Notch signaling pathways and regulates Delta (Dl)-mediated induction of support cells adjacent to photoreceptor neurons of the Drosophila eye. We describe a mechanism by which the Ebi/SMRTER corepressor complex maintains Dl expression. We identified a gene, charlatan (chn), which encodes a C2H2-type zinc-finger protein resembling human neuronal restricted silencing factor/repressor element RE-1 silencing transcription factor (NRSF/REST). The Ebi/SMRTER corepressor complex represses chn transcription by competing with the activation complex that includes the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Chn represses Dl expression and is critical for the initiation of eye development. Thus, under EGF signaling, double negative regulation mediated by the Ebi/SMRTER corepressor complex and an NRSF/REST-like factor, Chn, maintains inductive activity in developing photoreceptor cells by promoting Dl expression.

<ABSTRACT>
The unexpected encounter, 10 years ago, between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the chemokine system has dramatically advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, opening new perspectives for the development of effective prophylactic and therapeutic measures. To initiate infection, the HIV-1 external envelope glycoprotein, gp120, sequentially interacts with two cellular receptors, CD4 and a chemokine receptor (or coreceptor) like CCR5 or CXCR4. This peculiar two-stage receptor-interaction strategy allows gp120 to maintain the highly conserved coreceptor-binding site in a cryptic conformation, protected from neutralizing antibodies. The differential use of CCR5 and CXCR4 defines three HIV-1 biological variants (R5, R5X4, X4), which vary in their prevalence during the disease course. The evolutionary choice of HIV-1 to exploit chemokine receptors as cellular entry gateways has turned their chemokine ligands into endogenous antiviral factors that variably modulate viral transmission, disease progression and vaccine responses. Likewise, the natural history of HIV-1 infection is influenced by specific polymorphisms of chemokine and chemokine-receptor genes. The imminent clinical availability of coreceptor-targeted viral entry inhibitors raises new hope for bridging the gap towards a definitive cure of HIV infection.

A salvage pathway for phytol metabolism in Arabidopsis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Chlorophyll is the most abundant photosynthetic pigment in higher plants. During senescence, chlorophyll is hydrolyzed, resulting in the release of free phytol and chlorophyllide. Although the degradation of chlorophyllide has been studied in depth, the metabolic fate of phytol in plants is less clear. Here, we provide evidence that phytol can be incorporated into chlorophyll, tocopherol, and lipid esters by Arabidopsis seedlings. Phytol is phosphorylated to phytyl-phosphate and phytyl-diphosphate by two successive kinase activities associated with chloroplast envelope membranes of Arabidopsis. Although phytol kinase is CTP-dependent, the second kinase reaction, phytyl-phosphate kinase, shows broader specificity for CTP, GTP, UTP, and ATP. Therefore, in addition to de novo synthesis from geranylgeranyl-diphosphate, phosphorylation of free phytol represents an alternative route for phytyl-diphosphate production as the precursor for chloroplast prenyl lipid synthesis. Lipid esters are produced after feeding phytol to Arabidopsis seedlings, and they also accumulate in large amounts in leaves during senescence. The predominant phytyl ester that accumulates during senescence is hexadecatrienoic acid phytyl ester. Fatty acid phytyl ester synthesis by protein extracts of Arabidopsis is stimulated in the presence of phytol- and acyl-CoA esters. Thus, Arabidopsis contains a distinct enzymatic machinery for redirecting free phytol released from chlorophyll degradation into chloroplast lipid metabolism.

<ABSTRACT>
Processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a well acknowledged central pathogenic mechanism in Alzheimer disease. However, influences of age-associated cellular alterations on the biochemistry of APP processing have not been studied in molecular detail so far. Here, we report that processing of endogenous APP is down-regulated during the aging of normal human fibroblasts (IMR-90). The generation of intracellular APP cleavage products C99, C83, and AICD gradually declines with increasing life span and is accompanied by a reduced secretion of soluble APP (sAPP) and sAPPalpha. Further, the maturation of APP was reduced in senescent cells, which has been shown to be directly mediated by age-associated increased cellular cholesterol levels. Of the APP processing secretases, protein levels of constituents of the gamma-secretase complex, presenilin-1 (PS1) and nicastrin, were progressively reduced during aging, resulting in a progressive decrease in gamma-secretase enzymatic activity. ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) and BACE (beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme) protein levels exhibited no age-associated regulation, but interestingly, BACE enzymatic activity was increased in aged cells. PS1 and BACE are located in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), well structured membrane microdomains exhibiting high levels of cholesterol, and caveolin-1. Although total levels of both structural components of DRMs were up-regulated in aged cells, their particular DRM association was decreased. This age-dependent membrane modification was associated with an altered distribution of PS1 and BACE between DRM and non-DRM fractions, very likely affecting their APP processing potential. In conclusion, we have found a significant modulation of endogenous APP processing and maturation in human fibroblasts caused by age-associated alterations in cellular biochemistry.

Bcl-2 changes conformation to inhibit Bax oligomerization.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis by regulating the release of cytochrome c and other proteins from mitochondria. Oligomerization of Bax promotes cell death by permeabilizing the outer mitochondrial membrane. In transfected cells and isolated mitochondria, Bcl-2, but not the inactive point mutants Bcl-2-G145A and Bcl-2-V159D, undergoes a conformation change in the mitochondrial membrane in response to apoptotic agonists such as tBid and Bax. A mutant Bcl-2 with two cysteines introduced at positions predicted to result in a disulfide bond that would inhibit the mobility of alpha5-alpha6 helices (Bcl-2-S105C/E152C) was only active in a reducing environment. Thus, Bcl-2 must change the conformation to inhibit tBid-induced oligomerization of integral membrane Bax monomers and small oligomers. The conformationally changed Bcl-2 sequesters the integral membrane form of Bax. If Bax is in excess, apoptosis resumes as Bcl-2 is consumed by the conformational change and in complexes with Bax. Thus, Bcl-2 functions as an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeabilization by changing conformation in the mitochondrial membrane to bind membrane-inserted Bax monomers and prevent productive oligomerization of Bax.

Binding of PAI-1 to endothelial cells stimulated by thymosin beta4 and

<ABSTRACT>
Our previous studies showed that thymosin beta4 (Tbeta4) induced the synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) via the AP-1 dependent mechanism and its enhanced secretion. In this work we provide evidence that the released PAI-1 is accumulated on the surface of HUVECs, exclusively in its active form, in a complex with alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) that is also up-regulated and released from the cells. This mechanism is supported by several lines of experiments, in which expression of both proteins was analyzed by flow cytometry and their colocalization supported by confocal microscopy. PAI-1 did not bind to quiescent cells but only to the Tbeta4-activated endothelial cells. In contrast, significant amounts of AGP were found to be associated with the cells overexpressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) without Tbeta4 treatment. The AGP.PAI-1 complex was accumulated essentially at the basal surface of endothelial cells, and such cells showed (a) morphology characteristic for strongly adhered and spread cells and (b) significantly reduced plasmin formation. Taken together, these results provide the evidence supporting a novel mechanism by which active PAI-1 can be bound to the Tbeta4-activated endothelial cells, thus influencing their adhesive properties as well as their ability to generate plasmin.

infections in Drosophila.

<ABSTRACT>
The antimicrobial defence of Drosophila relies on cellular and humoral processes, of which the inducible synthesis of antimicrobial peptides has attracted interest in recent years. Another potential line of defence is the activation, by a proteolytic cascade, of phenoloxidase, which leads to the production of quinones and melanin. However, in spite of several publications on this subject, the contribution of phenoloxidase activation to resistance to infections has not been established under appropriate in vivo conditions. Here, we have isolated the first Drosophila mutant for a prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme (PAE1). In contrast to wild-type flies, PAE1 mutants fail to activate phenoloxidase in the haemolymph following microbial challenge. Surprisingly, we find that these mutants are as resistant to infections as wild-type flies, in the total absence of circulating phenoloxidase activity. This raises the question with regard to the precise function of phenoloxidase activation in defence, if any.

Glycosaminoglycan modification of neuropilin-1 modulates VEGFR2 signaling.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a co-receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that enhances the angiogenic signals cooperatively with VEGFR2. VEGF signaling is essential for physiological and pathological angiogenesis through its effects on vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), but the mechanisms coordinating this response are not well understood. Here we show that a substantial fraction of NRP1 is proteoglycan modified with either heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate on a single conserved Ser. The composition of the NRP1 glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains differs between ECs and SMCs. Glycosylation increased VEGF binding in both cell types, but the differential GAG composition of NRP1 mediates opposite responsiveness to VEGF in ECs and SMCs. Finally, NRP1 expression and its GAG modification post-transcriptionally regulate VEGFR2 protein expression. These findings indicate that GAG modification of NRP1 plays a critical role in modulating VEGF signaling, and may provide new insights into physiological and pathological angiogenesis.

The RAP1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac2 couples cyclic AMP and

<ABSTRACT>
Epac-1 and -2 (exchange proteins directly activated by cyclic AMP) are guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for the GTPases Rap1 and -2. Epac2 but not Epac1 was found to possess a RA (Ras association) domain similar to that found in the Ras effector Ral-GDS. This domain specifically bound Ras-GTP, enabling oncogenic Ras to translocate Epac2 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Consequently, a small pool of plasma membrane-bound Rap1 was activated at the expense of bulk Rap1 located on intracellular organelles. Whereas translocation of Epac2 was not mimicked by challenge with epidermal growth factor alone, costimulation with forskolin, prostaglandin E2, or an Epac-selective cyclic AMP analog-induced rapid relocation of GFP-Epac2 but not -Epac1 to the plasma membrane in a Ras-dependent manner. Deletion of the cyclic AMP-binding domain overcame the need for nucleotide, suggesting that this domain normally masked the RA domain in the resting GEF. Thus, Epac2 can respond to costimulation by agonists that jointly elevate Ras-GTP and cyclic AMP levels, activating a specific pool of Rap1 at the plasma membrane. Therefore, despite its previous description as a Ras antagonist or independently functioning GTPase, Rap1/Krev-1 may additionally act downstream of Ras in cells that express the cyclic AMP-regulated GEF, Epac2.

Src kinase phosphorylates Caspase-8 on Tyr380: a novel mechanism of
apoptosis suppression.

<ABSTRACT>
We identified Caspase-8 as a new substrate for Src kinase. Phosphorylation occurs on Tyr380, situated in the linker region between the large and the small subunits of human Procaspase-8, and results in downregulation of Caspase-8 proapoptotic function. Src activation triggers Caspase-8 phosphorylation on Tyr380 and impairs Fas-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, Src failed to protect Caspase-8-defective human cells in which a Caspase-8-Y380F mutant is expressed from Fas-induced cell death. Remarkably, Src activation upon EGF-receptor stimulation triggers endogenous Caspase-8 phosphorylation and prevents Fas-induced apoptosis. Tyr380 is phosphorylated also in human colon cancers where Src is aberrantly activated. These data provide the first evidence for a direct role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the control of caspases and reveal a new mechanism through which tyrosine kinases inhibit apoptosis and participate in tumor progression.

<ABSTRACT>
K/BxN mice develop an inflammatory joint disease with many features characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis. In this model, the KRN transgenic T cells and nontransgenic B cells both recognize the glycolytic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate-isomerase (GPI) as an autoantigen. Here, we followed the anti-GPI B cell response that naturally arises in K/BxN mice. The anti-GPI B cell response was robust and arose at the same time as the development of serum anti-GPI autoantibody and joint inflammation. Surprisingly, although GPI was expressed systemically, the anti-GPI B cell response was focused to the lymph nodes (LN) draining the distal joints where arthritis was evident. In lymphotoxin-beta receptor-Ig-treated mice, which lack LNs, the development of arthritis was completely inhibited up to 5-6 weeks. At later times, some arthritis did develop, but at a significantly reduced level. Thus, in this spontaneous model of autoimmunity, the LNs draining the distal joints are essential for both the inhibition and amplification of the arthritogenic B cell response. These findings imply that the immune physiology of a joint is unique, resulting in a local immune response to a systemic autoantigen.

<ABSTRACT>
Kinesin-1 is a processive molecular motor transporting cargo along microtubules. Inside cells, several motors and microtubule-associated proteins compete for binding to microtubules. Therefore, the question arises how processive movement of kinesin-1 is affected by crowding on the microtubule. Here we use total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to image in vitro the runs of single quantum dot-labelled kinesins on crowded microtubules under steady-state conditions and to measure the degree of crowding on a microtubule at steady-state. We find that the runs of kinesins are little affected by high kinesin densities on a microtubule. However, the presence of high densities of a mutant kinesin that is not able to step efficiently reduces the average speed of wild-type kinesin, while hardly changing its processivity. This indicates that kinesin waits in a strongly bound state on the microtubule when encountering an obstacle until the obstacle unbinds and frees the binding site for kinesin's next step. A simple kinetic model can explain quantitatively the behaviour of kinesin under both crowding conditions.

<ABSTRACT>
We have investigated the communication between subunits in replication factor C (RFC) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. Mutation of the proposed arginine finger in the small subunits results in a complex that can still bind ATP but has impaired clamp-loading activity, a process that normally only requires binding of nucleotide. The small subunit alone forms a hexameric ring that is six-fold symmetric in the absence of ATP. However, this symmetry is broken when the nucleotide is bound to the complex. A conformational change associated with nucleotide binding may relate to the opening of PCNA rings by RFC during the loading reaction. The structures also reveal the importance of the N-terminal helix of each subunit at the ATP-binding site. Analysis of mutant protein complexes containing subunits lacking this N-terminal helix reveals key distinct regulatory roles during clamp loading that are different for the large and small subunits in the RFC complex.

<ABSTRACT>
Transient receptor potential (TRP) channel, melastatin subfamily (TRPM)4 is a Ca2+-activated monovalent cation channel that depolarizes the plasma membrane and thereby modulates Ca2+ influx through Ca2+-permeable pathways. A typical feature of TRPM4 is its rapid desensitization to intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). Here we show that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) counteracts desensitization to [Ca2+]i in inside-out patches and rundown of TRPM4 currents in whole-cell patch-clamp experiments. PIP2 shifted the voltage dependence of TRPM4 activation towards negative potentials and increased the channel's Ca2+ sensitivity 100-fold. Conversely, activation of the phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled M1 muscarinic receptor or pharmacological depletion of cellular PIP2 potently inhibited currents through TRPM4. Neutralization of basic residues in a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain accelerated TRPM4 current desensitization and strongly attenuated the effect of PIP2, whereas mutations to the C-terminal TRP box and TRP domain had no effect on the PIP2 sensitivity. Our data demonstrate that PIP2 is a strong positive modulator of TRPM4, and implicate the C-terminal PH domain in PIP2 action. PLC-mediated PIP2 breakdown may constitute a physiologically important brake on TRPM4 activity.

<ABSTRACT>
The post-translational modification of histones regulates many cellular processes, including transcription, replication and DNA repair. A large number of combinations of post-translational modifications are possible. This cipher is referred to as the histone code. Many of the enzymes that lay down this code have been identified. However, so far, few code-reading proteins have been identified. Here, we describe a protein-array approach for identifying methyl-specific interacting proteins. We found that not only chromo domains but also tudor and MBT domains bind to methylated peptides from the amino-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4. Binding specificity observed on the protein-domain microarray was corroborated using peptide pull-downs, surface plasma resonance and far western blotting. Thus, our studies expose tudor and MBT domains as new classes of methyl-lysine-binding protein modules, and also demonstrates that protein-domain microarrays are powerful tools for the identification of new domain types that recognize histone modifications.

<ABSTRACT>
The peribacteroid membrane (PBM) surrounding nitrogen fixing rhizobia in the nodules of legumes is crucial for the exchange of ammonium and nutrients between the bacteria and the host cell. Digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), a galactolipid abundant in chloroplasts, was detected in the PBM of soybean (Glycine max) and Lotus japonicus. Analyses of membrane marker proteins and of fatty acid composition confirmed that DGDG represents an authentic PBM lipid of plant origin and is not derived from the bacteria or from plastid contamination. In Arabidopsis, DGDG is known to accumulate in extraplastidic membranes during phosphate deprivation. However, the presence of DGDG in soybean PBM was not restricted to phosphate limiting conditions. Complementary DNA sequences corresponding to the two DGDG synthases, DGD1 and DGD2 from Arabidopsis, were isolated from soybean and Lotus. The two genes were expressed during later stages of nodule development in infected cells and in cortical tissue. Because nodule development depends on the presence of high amounts of phosphate in the growth medium, the accumulation of the non-phosphorus galactolipid DGDG in the PBM might be important to save phosphate for other essential processes, i.e. nucleic acid synthesis in bacteroids and host cells.

Smad6 interacts with Runx2 and mediates Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor
1-induced Runx2 degradation.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Runx2 is a bone-specific transcription factor that plays a critical role in bone development, postnatal bone formation, and chondrocyte maturation. The protein levels of Runx2 are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In previous studies we discovered that E3 ubiquitin ligase Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) induces Runx2 degradation in a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner, and Smurf1 plays an important role in osteoblast function and bone formation. In the present studies we investigated the molecular mechanism of Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation. Smurf1 interacts with the PY motif of substrate proteins, and a PY motif has been identified in the C terminus of the Runx2 protein. To determine whether Smurf1 induces Runx2 degradation through the interaction with the PY motif of Runx2, we created a mutant Runx2 with a PY motif deletion and found that Smurf1 retained some of its ability to induce the degradation of the mutant Runx2, suggesting that Smurf1 could induce Runx2 degradation through an indirect mechanism. Smurf1 has been shown to interact with Smads 1, 5, 6, and 7, and Smads 1 and 5 also interact with Runx2. In the present studies we found that Smads 1 and 5 had no effect on Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation. Although Smads 6 and 7 bind Smurf1, it is not known if Smads 6 or 7 interacts with Runx2 and mediate Runx2 degradation. We performed immunoprecipitation assays and found that Smad6 but not Smad7 interacts with Runx2. Smad6 enhances Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation in an ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that in addition to its interaction with the PY motif of Runx2, Smurf1 induces Runx2 degradation in a Smad6-dependent manner. Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation serves as a negative regulatory mechanism for the BMP-Smad-Runx2 signaling pathway.

A non-terrestrial 16O-rich isotopic composition for the protosolar nebula.

<ABSTRACT>
The discovery in primitive components of meteorites of large oxygen isotopic variations that could not be attributed to mass-dependent fractionation effects has raised a fundamental question: what is the composition of the protosolar gas from which the host grains formed? This composition is probably preserved in the outer layers of the Sun, but the resolution of astronomical spectroscopic measurements is still too poor to be useful for comparison with planetary material. Here we report a precise determination of the oxygen isotopic composition of the solar wind from particles implanted in the outer hundreds of nanometres of metallic grains in the lunar regolith. These layers of the grains are enriched in 16O by >20 +/- 4 per thousand relative to the Earth, Mars and bulk meteorites, which implies the existence in the solar accretion disk of reactions--as yet unknown--that were able to change the 17O/16O and 18O/16O ratios in a way that was not dependent strictly on the mass of the isotope. Photochemical self-shielding of the CO gas irradiated by ultraviolet light may be one of these key processes, because it depends on the abundance of the isotopes, rather than their masses.

<ABSTRACT>
WNK (with no lysine (K)) protein kinases are found in many eukaryotes and share a unique active site. Here, we report that a member of the Arabidopsis WNK family (AtWNK8) interacts with subunit C of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) via a short C-terminal domain. AtWNK8 is shown to autophosphorylate intermolecularly and to phosphorylate Arabidopsis subunit C (AtVHA-C) at multiple sites as determined by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Furthermore, we show that AtVHA-C and other V-ATPase subunits are phosphorylated when V1-complexes are used as substrates for AtWNK8. Taken together, our results provide evidence that V-ATPases are potential targets of WNK kinases and their associated signaling pathways.

Identification of the linear epitope for Fc-binding on the bovine IgG2 Fc

<ABSTRACT>
To identify the linear epitope for Fc-binding on the bovine IgG2 Fc receptor (boFcgamma2R), peptides derived from the membrane-distal extracellular domain (EC1) of boFcgamma2R corresponding to the homologous region of human FcalphaRI were synthesized. Binding of bovine IgG2 to the different peptides was tested by Dot-blot assay, and the peptide showing maximal binding was further modified by truncation and mutation. The minimum effective peptide 82FIGV85 located in the putative F-G loop of the EC1 domain was found to bind bovine IgG2 specifically and inhibit the binding of bovine IgG2 to the receptor. The Phe82, Ile83 and Val85 residues within the linear epitope were shown to be critical for IgG2-binding. Such functional epitope peptide should be very useful for understanding the IgG-Fcgamma interaction and development of FcR-targeting drugs.

The Polycomb group protein Eed protects the inactive X-chromosome from
differentiation-induced reactivation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Polycomb group (PcG) encodes an evolutionarily conserved set of chromatin-modifying proteins that are thought to maintain cellular transcriptional memory by stably silencing gene expression. In mouse embryos that are mutated for the PcG protein Eed, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is not stably maintained in extra-embryonic tissues. Eed is a component of a histone-methyltransferase complex that is thought to contribute to stable silencing in undifferentiated cells due to its enrichment on the inactive X-chromosome in cells of the early mouse embryo and in stem cells of the extra-embryonic trophectoderm lineage. Here, we demonstrate that the inactive X-chromosome in Eed(-/-) trophoblast stem cells and in cells of the trophectoderm-derived extra-embryonic ectoderm in Eed(-/-) embryos remain transcriptionally silent, despite lacking the PcG-mediated histone modifications that normally characterize the facultative heterochromatin of the inactive X-chromosome. Whereas undifferentiated Eed(-/-) trophoblast stem cells maintained XCI, reactivation of the inactive X-chromosome occurred when these cells were differentiated. These results indicate that PcG complexes are not necessary to maintain transcriptional silencing of the inactive X-chromosome in undifferentiated stem cells. Instead, PcG proteins seem to propagate cellular memory by preventing transcriptional activation of facultative heterochromatin during differentiation.

RuvAB is essential for replication forks reversal in certain replication
mutants.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Inactivated replication forks may be reversed by the annealing of leading- and lagging-strand ends, resulting in the formation of a Holliday junction (HJ) adjacent to a DNA double-strand end. In Escherichia coli mutants deficient for double-strand end processing, resolution of the HJ by RuvABC leads to fork breakage, a reaction that we can directly quantify. Here we used the HJ-specific resolvase RusA to test a putative role of the RuvAB helicase in replication fork reversal (RFR). We show that the RuvAB complex is required for the formation of a RusA substrate in the polymerase III mutants dnaEts and holD, affected for the Pol III catalytic subunit and clamp loader, and in the helicase mutant rep. This finding reveals that the recombination enzyme RuvAB targets forks in vivo and we propose that it directly converts forks into HJs. In contrast, RFR occurs in the absence of RuvAB in the dnaNts mutant, affected for the processivity clamp of Pol III, and in the priA mutant, defective for replication restart. This suggests alternative pathways of RFR.

Reduced phosphatase activity of SHP-2 in LEOPARD syndrome: consequences

<ABSTRACT>
LEOPARD (LS) and Noonan (NS) are overlapping syndromes associated with distinct mutations of SHP-2. Whereas NS mutations enhance SHP-2 catalytic activity, we show that the activity of three representative LS mutants is undetectable when assayed using a standard protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) substrate. A different assay using a specific SHP-2 substrate confirms their decreased PTP activity, but also reveals a significant activity of the T468M mutant. In transfected cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor, the least active LS mutants promote Gab1/PI3K binding, validating our in vitro data. LS mutants thus display a reduced PTP activity both in vitro and in transfected cells.

<ABSTRACT>
iNOS mRNA of J774 murine macrophage cells was cleaved by 10-23 DNAzymes. DNAzyme target site I or translation initiation site and site II have computer predicted (MFOLD) secondary structures but site III has no secondary structure. All the three DNAzymes cleaved the short transcripts generated from cloned DNA almost with equal efficiency while cleavage efficiency is higher at site III than the other two sites on isolated iNOS mRNA. Interestingly, at intracellular level, DNAzyme targeted at translation initiation codon (site I) having secondary structure cleaved iNOS mRNA, and suppressed its activity and protein expression more efficiently than that targeted at sites II and III.

<ABSTRACT>
A screening for intracellular interactors of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) identified brain-expressed X-linked 1 (Bex1), a small adaptor-like protein of unknown function. Bex1 levels oscillated during the cell cycle, and preventing the normal cycling and downregulation of Bex1 in PC12 cells sustained cell proliferation under conditions of growth arrest, and inhibited neuronal differentiation in response to nerve growth factor (NGF). Neuronal differentiation of precursors isolated from the brain subventricular zone was also reduced by ectopic Bex1. In PC12 cells, Bex1 overexpression inhibited the induction of NF-kappaB activity by NGF without affecting activation of Erk1/2 and AKT, while Bex1 knockdown accelerated neuronal differentiation and potentiated NF-kappaB activity in response to NGF. Bex1 competed with RIP2 for binding to the p75NTR intracellular domain, and elevating RIP2 levels restored the ability of cells overexpressing Bex1 to differentiate in response to NGF. Together, these data establish Bex1 as a novel link between neurotrophin signaling, the cell cycle, and neuronal differentiation, and suggest that Bex1 may function by coordinating internal cellular states with the ability of cells to respond to external signals.

Tumorigenic transformation by CPI-17 through inhibition of a merlin
phosphatase.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The tumour suppressor protein merlin (encoded by the neurofibromatosis type 2 gene NF2) is an important regulator of proliferation in many cell and tissue types. Merlin is activated by dephosphorylation at serine 518 (S518), which occurs on serum withdrawal or on cell-cell or cell-matrix contact. However, the relevant phosphatase that activates merlin's tumour suppressor function is unknown. Here we identify this enzyme as the myosin phosphatase (MYPT-1-PP1delta). The cellular MYPT-1-PP1delta-specific inhibitor CPI-17 causes a loss of merlin function characterized by merlin phosphorylation, Ras activation and transformation. Constitutively active merlin (S518A) reverses CPI-17-induced transformation, showing that merlin is the decisive substrate of MYPT-1-PP1delta in tumour suppression. In addition we show that CPI-17 levels are raised in several human tumour cell lines and that the downregulation of CPI-17 induces merlin dephosphorylation, inhibits Ras activation and abolishes the transformed phenotype. MYPT-1-PP1delta and its substrate merlin are part of a previously undescribed tumour suppressor cascade that can be hindered in two ways, by mutation of the NF2 gene and by upregulation of the oncoprotein CPI-17.

T-cell tolerance or function is determined by combinatorial costimulatory
signals.

<ABSTRACT>
Activated in immune responses, T lymphocytes differentiate into effector cells with potent immune function. CD28 is the most prominent costimulatory receptor for T-cell activation. However, absence of CD28 costimulation did not completely impair effector function of CD4 or CD8 T cells. Moreover, increasing number of costimulatory molecules are recently found on antigen-presenting cells to regulate T-cell activation. To understand the molecular mechanisms that determine T-cell function or tolerance, we have collectively examined the roles of positive and negative costimulatory molecules. Antigen-specific naive CD4 and CD8 T cells, only when activated in the absence of both CD28 and ICOS pathways, were completely impaired in effector function. These tolerant T cells not only were anergic with profound defects in TcR signal transduction but also completely lacked expression of effector-specific transcription factors. T-cell tolerance induction in this system requires the action by negative costimulatory molecules; T-cell proliferation and function was partially restored by inhibiting PD-1, B7-H3 or B7S1. This work demonstrates that T-cell function or tolerance is controlled by costimulatory signals.

Crystal structure of AqpZ tetramer reveals two distinct Arg-189

constriction of the water-conducting channel.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
AqpZ is a homotetramer of four water-conducting channels that facilitate rapid water movements across the plasma membrane of Escherichia coli. Here we report a 3.2 angstroms crystal structure of the tetrameric AqpZ (tAqpZ). All channel-lining residues in the four monomeric channels are found orientated in nearly identical positions with one marked exception at the narrowest channel constriction, where the side chain of a highly conserved Arg-189 adopts two distinct conformational orientations. In one of the four monomers, the guanidino group of Arg-189 points toward the periplasmic vestibule, opening up the constriction to accommodate the binding of a water molecule through a tridentate H-bond. In the other three monomers, the Arg-189 guanidino group bends over to form an H-bond with carbonyl oxygen of the Thr-183, thus occluding the channel. Therefore, the tAqpZ structure reveals two distinct Arg-189 confirmations associated with water permeation through the channel constrictions. Alternation between the two Arg-189 conformations disrupts continuous flow of water, thus regulating the open probability of the water pore. Further, the difference in Arg-189 displacements is correlated with a strong electron density found between the first transmembrane helices of two open channels, suggesting that the observed Arg-189 conformations are stabilized by asymmetrical subunit interactions in tAqpZ.

DNA replication stress-induced phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response
element-binding protein mediated by ATM.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The DNA damage-response regulators ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated) and ATR (ATM-Rad3-related) are structurally and functionally related protein kinases that exhibit nearly identical substrate specificities in vitro. Current paradigms hold that the relative contributions of ATM and ATR to nuclear substrate phosphorylation are dictated by the type of initiating DNA lesion; ATM-dependent substrate phosphorylation is principally activated by DNA double strand breaks, whereas ATR-dependent substrate phosphorylation is induced by UV light and other forms of DNA replication stress. In this report, we employed the cyclic AMP-response element-binding (CREB) protein to provide evidence for substrate discrimination by ATM and ATR in cellulo. ATM and ATR phosphorylate CREB in vitro, and CREB is phosphorylated on Ser-121 in intact cells in response to ionizing radiation (IR), UV light, and hydroxyurea. The UV light- and hydroxyurea-induced phosphorylation of CREB was delayed in comparison to the canonical ATR substrate CHK1, suggesting potentially different mechanisms of phosphorylation. UV light-induced CREB phosphorylation temporally correlated with ATM autophosphorylation on Ser-1981, and an ATM-specific small interfering RNA suppressed CREB phosphorylation in response to this stimulus. UV light-induced CREB phosphorylation was absent in ATM-deficient cells, confirming that ATM is required for CREB phosphorylation in UV irradiation-damaged cells. Interestingly, RNA interference-mediated suppression of ATR partially inhibited CREB phosphorylation in response to UV light, which correlated with reduced phosphorylation of ATM on Ser-1981. These findings suggest that ATM is the major genotoxin-induced CREB kinase in mammalian cells and that ATR lies upstream of ATM in a UV light-induced signaling pathway.

Poly(A) binding protein (PABP) homeostasis is mediated by the stability of
its inhibitor, Paip2.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is a unique translation initiation factor in that it binds to the mRNA 3' poly(A) tail and stimulates recruitment of the ribosome to the mRNA at the 5' end. PABP activity is tightly controlled by the PABP-interacting protein 2 (Paip2), which inhibits translation by displacing PABP from the mRNA. Here, we describe a close interplay between PABP and Paip2 protein levels in the cell. We demonstrate a mechanism for this co-regulation that involves an E3 ubiquitin ligase, EDD, which targets Paip2 for degradation. PABP depletion by RNA interference (RNAi) causes co-depletion of Paip2 protein without affecting Paip2 mRNA levels. Upon PABP knockdown, Paip2 interacts with EDD, which leads to Paip2 ubiquitination. Supporting a critical role for EDD in Paip2 degradation, knockdown of EDD expression by siRNA leads to an increase in Paip2 protein stability. Thus, we demonstrate that the turnover of Paip2 in the cell is mediated by EDD and is regulated by PABP. This mechanism serves as a homeostatic feedback to control the activity of PABP in cells.

Hsp70 inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappaB activation by
interacting with TRAF6 and inhibiting its ubiquitination.

<ABSTRACT>
Inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is one of the most important HSPs for maintenance of cell integrity during normal cellular growth as well as pathophysiological conditions. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is a crucial signaling transducer that regulates a diverse array of physiological and pathological processes and is essential for activating NF-kappaB signaling pathway in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here we report a novel mechanism of Hsp70 for preventing LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells. Our results show that Hsp70 can associate with TRAF6 physically in the TRAF-C domain and prevent TRAF6 ubiquitination. The stimulation of LPS dissociates the binding of Hsp70 and TRAF6 in a time-dependent manner. Hsp70 inhibits LPS-induced NF-kappaB signaling cascade activation in heat-shock treated as well as Hsp70 stable transfected RAW264.7 cells and subsequently decreases iNOS and COX-2 expression. Two Hsp70 mutants, Hsp70DeltaC(1-428aa) with N-terminal ATPase domain and Hsp70C(428-642aa) with C-terminal domain, lack the ability to influence TRAF6 ubiquitination and TRAF6-triggered NF-kappaB activation. Taken together, these findings indicate that Hsp70 inhibits LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation by binding TRAF6 and preventing its ubiquitination, and results in inhibition of inflammatory mediator production, which provides a new insight for analyzing the effects of Hsp70 on LPS-triggered inflammatory signal transduction pathways.

<ABSTRACT>
LKB1, a unique serine/threonine kinase tumor suppressor, modulates anabolic and catabolic homeostasis, cell proliferation, and organ polarity. Chemically reactive lipids, e.g. cyclopentenone prostaglandins, formed a covalent adduct with LKB1 in MCF-7 and RKO cells. Site-directed mutagenesis implicated Cys210 in the LKB1 activation loop as the residue modified. Notably, ERK, JNK, and AKT serine/threonine kinases with leucine or methionine, instead of cysteine, in their activation loop did not form a covalent lipid adduct. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal, 4-oxo-2-nonenal, and cyclopentenone prostaglandin A and J, which all contain alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyls, inhibited the AMP-kinase kinase activity of cellular LKB1. In turn, this attenuated signals throughout the LKB1 --> AMP kinase pathway and disrupted its restraint of ribosomal S6 kinases. The electrophilic beta-carbon in these lipids appears to be critical for inhibition because unreactive lipids, e.g. PGB1, PGE2, PGF2alpha, and TxB2, did not inhibit LKB1 activity (p > 0.05). Ectopic expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and endogenous biosynthesis of eicosanoids also inhibited LKB1 activity in MCF-7 cells. Our results suggested a molecular mechanism whereby chronic inflammation or oxidative stress may confer risk for hypertrophic or neoplastic diseases. Moreover, chemical inactivation of LKB1 may interfere with its physiological antagonism of signals from growth factors, insulin, and oncogenes.

differentiation of erythroid cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Erythroid cells terminally differentiate in response to erythropoietin binding its cognate receptor. Previously we have shown that the tyrosine kinase Lyn associates with the erythropoietin receptor and is essential for hemoglobin synthesis in three erythroleukemic cell lines. To understand Lyn signaling events in erythroid cells, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to analyze interactions with other proteins. Here we show that the hemopoietic-specific protein HS1 interacted directly with the SH3 domain of Lyn, via its proline-rich region. A truncated HS1, bearing the Lyn-binding domain, was introduced into J2E erythroleukemic cells to determine the impact upon responsiveness to erythropoietin. Truncated HS1 had a striking effect on the phenotype of the J2E line-the cells were smaller, more basophilic than the parental proerythoblastoid cells and had fewer surface erythropoietin receptors. Moreover, basal and erythropoietin-induced proliferation and differentiation were markedly suppressed. The inability of cells containing the truncated HS1 to differentiate may be a consequence of markedly reduced levels of Lyn and GATA-1. In addition, erythropoietin stimulation of these cells resulted in rapid, endosome-mediated degradation of endogenous HS1. The truncated HS1 also suppressed the development of erythroid colonies from fetal liver cells. These data show that disrupting HS1 has profoundly influenced the ability of erythroid cells to terminally differentiate.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) are ubiquitous enzymes that repress gene expression by deacetylating histone tails and promoting chromatin compaction. Pro-inflammatory agents activate programmes of gene expression through transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), even in the context of ubiquitous HDAC activity. How this is accomplished remains unknown. We found that cells treated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-alpha rapidly and substantially reduced HDAC1 protein levels without affecting other class I HDACs. In addition, HDAC1 depletion occurred through protein degradation, required IKK2 activity and resulted in increased transcription from both NF-kappaB-associated and unassociated gene promoters. Our study suggests that the activation of programmes of gene expression by pro-inflammatory agents requires global changes in specific critical epigenetic regulators such as HDAC1.

<ABSTRACT>
The ability of dimorphic transition between yeast and hyphal forms in Candida albicans is one of the vital determinants for its pathogenicity and virulence. We isolated C. albicans SWI1 as a suppressor of the invasive growth defect in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant. Expression of C. albicans SWI1 in S. cerevisiae partially complemented the growth defect of a swi1 mutant in the utilization of glycerol. Swi1 is in a complex with Snf2 in C. albicans, and both proteins are localized in the nucleus independent of the growth form. Deleting SWI1 or SNF2 in C. albicans prevented true hyphal formation and resulted in constitutive pseudohypha-like growth in all media examined. Furthermore, swi1/swi1 mutant was defective in hypha-specific gene expression and avirulent in a mouse model of systemic infection. These data strongly suggest the conserved Swi/Snf complex in C. albicans is required for hyphal development and pathogenicity.

<ABSTRACT>
Thioredoxins type h are classified into three subgroups. The subgroup II includes thioredoxins containing an N-terminal extension, the role of which is still unclear. Although thioredoxin secretion has been observed in animal cells, there is no evidence suggesting that any thioredoxin h is secreted in plants. In this study, we report that a thioredoxin h, subgroup II, from Nicotiana alata (NaTrxh) is secreted into the extracellular matrix of the stylar transmitting tract tissue. Fractionation studies showed that NaTrxh is extracted along with well characterized secretion proteins such as S-RNases and NaTTS (N. alata transmitting tissue-specific protein). Moreover, an NaTrxh-green fluorescent fusion protein transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves was also secreted, showing that NaTrxh has the required information for its secretion. We performed reduction assays in vitro to identify potential extracellular targets of NaTrxh. We found that S-RNase is one of the several potential substrates of the NaTrxh in the extracellular matrix. In addition, we proved by affinity chromatography that NaTrxh specifically interacts with S-RNase. Our findings showed that NaTrxh is a new thioredoxin h in Nicotiana that is secreted as well as in animal systems. Because NaTrxh is localized in the extracellular matrix of the stylar transmitting tract and its specific interaction with S-RNase to reduce it in vitro, we suggest that this thioredoxin h may be involved either in general pollen-pistil interaction processes or particularly in S-RNase-based self-incompatibility.

Regulation of MDMX nuclear import and degradation by Chk2 and 14-3-3.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The MDM2 homolog MDMX is an important regulator of p53 during mouse embryonic development. DNA damage promotes MDMX phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and degradation by MDM2. Here we show that MDMX copurifies with 14-3-3, and DNA damage stimulates MDMX binding to 14-3-3. Chk2-mediated phosphorylation of MDMX on S367 is important for stimulating 14-3-3 binding, MDMX nuclear import by a cryptic nuclear import signal, and degradation by MDM2. Mutation of MDMX S367 inhibits ubiquitination and degradation by MDM2, and prevents MDMX nuclear import. Expression of 14-3-3 stimulates the degradation of phosphorylated MDMX. Chk2 and 14-3-3 cooperatively stimulate MDMX ubiquitination and overcome the inhibition of p53 by MDMX. These results suggest that MDMX-14-3-3 interaction plays a role in p53 response to DNA damage by regulating MDMX localization and stability.

Sterols regulate ER-export dynamics of secretory cargo protein ts-O45-G.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Alterations in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cholesterol are fundamental for a variety of cellular processes such as the regulation of lipid homeostasis or efficient protein degradation. We show that reduced levels of cellular sterols cause a delayed ER-to-Golgi transport of the secretory cargo membrane protein ts-O45-G and a relocation to the ER of an endogenous protein cycling between the ER and the Golgi complex. Transport inhibition is characterized by a delay in the accumulation of ts-O45-G in ER-exit sites (ERES) and correlates with a reduced mobility of ts-O45-G within ER membranes. A simple mathematical model describing the kinetics of ER-exit predicts that reduced cargo loading to ERES and not the reduced mobility of ts-O45-G accounts for the delayed ER-exit and arrival at the Golgi. Consistent with this, membrane turnover of the COPII component Sec23p is delayed in sterol-depleted cells. Altogether, our results demonstrate the importance of sterol levels in COPII mediated ER-export.

Apoptosis regulation in tetraploid cancer cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Tetraploidy can result in cancer-associated aneuploidy. As shown here, freshly generated tetraploid cells arising due to mitotic slippage or failed cytokinesis are prone to undergo Bax-dependent mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and subsequent apoptosis. Knockout of Bax or overexpression of Bcl-2 facilitated the survival of tetraploid cells at least as efficiently as the p53 or p21 knockout. When tetraploid cells were derived from diploid p53 and Bax-proficient precursors, such cells exhibited an enhanced transcription of p53 target genes. Tetraploid cells exhibited an enhanced rate of spontaneous apoptosis that could be suppressed by inhibition of p53 or by knockdown of proapoptotic p53 target genes such as BBC3/Puma, GADD45A and ferredoxin reductase. Unexpectedly, tetraploid cells were more resistant to DNA damaging agents (cisplatin, oxaliplatin and camptothecin) than their diploid counterparts, and this difference disappeared upon inhibition of p53 or knockdown of p53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase. Tetraploid cells were also more resistant against UVC and gamma-irradiation. These data indicate the existence of p53-dependent alterations in apoptosis regulation in tetraploid cells.

Leader sequence of a plant ribosomal protein gene with complementarity to
the 18S rRNA triggers in vitro cap-independent translation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cap-independent translation (CIT) occurs at the leader sequences of uncapped plant viral RNAs, but also at a number of normally capped cellular mRNAs and has been correlated with sequence complementarity to 18S rRNA. The ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18) is a component of the small ribosomal subunit and is encoded by three gene copies (A, B, and C) in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. The RPS18C mRNA was most abundant and contained a short 5' untranslated region of 84 bp that is complementary to a novel putative interaction site at the 3' end of the 18S rRNA. The RPS18C leader mediated CIT as demonstrated by dicistronic constructs consisting of luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter genes in an in vitro wheat germ extract system. CIT was rapidly inhibited upon addition of an oligonucleotide that competed for the 18S rRNA site complementary to the RPS18C leader and interfered with polysome assembly at the transcript.

Identification and characterization of a mammalian 39-kDa poly(ADP-ribose)
glycohydrolase.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification resulting from transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD to protein. Mammalian cells contain mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases that catalyze the formation of ADP-ribose-(arginine) protein, which can be cleaved by a 39-kDa ADP-ribose-(arginine) protein hydrolase (ARH1), resulting in release of free ADP-ribose and regeneration of unmodified protein. Enzymes involved in poly(ADP-ribosylation) participate in several critical physiological processes, including DNA repair, cellular differentiation, and carcinogenesis. Multiple poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases have been identified in the human genome, but there is only one known poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), a 111-kDa protein that degrades the (ADP-ribose) polymer to ADP-ribose. We report here the identification of an ARH1-like protein, termed poly(ADP-ribose) hydrolase or ARH3, which exhibited PARG activity, generating ADP-ribose from poly-(ADP-ribose), but did not hydrolyze ADP-ribose-arginine, -cysteine, -diphthamide, or -asparagine bonds. The 39-kDa ARH3 shares amino acid sequence identity with both ARH1 and the catalytic domain of PARG. ARH3 activity, like that of ARH1, was enhanced by Mg(2+). Critical vicinal acidic amino acids in ARH3, identified by mutagenesis (Asp(77) and Asp(78)), are located in a region similar to that required for activity in ARH1 but different from the location of the critical vicinal glutamates in the PARG catalytic site. All findings are consistent with the conclusion that ARH3 has PARG activity but is structurally unrelated to PARG.

Differences in eNOS activity because of subcellular localization are
dictated by phosphorylation state rather than the local calcium
environment.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Nitric oxide (NO) produced in the endothelium via the enzyme endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is an important vasoactive compound. Wild-type (WT) eNOS is localized to the plasma membrane and perinuclear/Golgi region by virtue of N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation. Acylation-deficient mutants (G2AeNOS) remain cytosolic and release less NO in response to Ca2+-elevating agonists; a disparity that we hypothesized was attributed to the greater distance between G2AeNOS and plasma membrane Ca2+ influx channels. The reduced activity of G2AeNOS versus WT was reversed upon disruption of cellular integrity with detergents or sonication. NO production from both constructs relied almost exclusively on the influx of extracellular Ca2+, and elevating intracellular Ca2+ to saturating levels with 10 microM ionomycin in the presence of 10 mM extracellular Ca2+ equalized NO production. To identify the contribution of calcium to the differences in activity between these enzymes, we created Ca2+/CaM-independent eNOS mutants by deleting the two putative autoinhibitory domains of eNOS. There was no difference in NO production between WT and G2A-targeted Ca2+-independent eNOS, suggesting that Ca2+ was the factor responsible. When eNOS constructs were fused in-frame to the bioluminescent probe aequorin, membrane-bound probes were exposed to higher [Ca2+] in unstimulated cells but upon ionomycin stimulation, the probes experienced equal amounts of Ca2+. The WT and G2A enzymes displayed significant differences in the phosphorylation state of Ser617, Ser635, and Ser1179, and mutating all three sites to alanine or restoring phosphorylation with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin abolished the differences in activity. We therefore conclude that the disparity in NO production between WTeNOS and G2AeNOS is not caused by different localized [Ca2+] upon stimulation with ionomycin, but rather differences in phosphorylation state between the two constructs.

Transient IkappaB kinase activity mediates temporal NF-kappaB dynamics in

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Dynamic properties of signaling pathways control their behavior and function. We undertook an iterative computational and experimental investigation of the dynamic properties of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Surprisingly, we found that the temporal profile of the NF-kappaB activity is invariant to the TNFalpha dose. We reverse engineered a computational model of the signaling pathway to identify mechanisms that impart this important response characteristic, thus predicting that the IKK activity profile must transiently peak at all TNFalpha doses to generate the observed NF-kappaB dynamics. Experimental confirmation of this prediction emphasizes the importance of mechanisms that rapidly down-regulate IKK following TNFalpha activation. A refined computational model further revealed signaling characteristics that ensure robust TNFalpha-mediated cell-cell communication over considerable distances, allowing for fidelity of cellular inflammatory responses in infected tissue.

Misorientation and reduced stretching of aligned sister kinetochores
promote chromosome missegregation in EB1- or APC-depleted cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The correct formation of stable but dynamic links between chromosomes and spindle microtubules (MTs) is essential for accurate chromosome segregation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which kinetochores bind MTs and checkpoints monitor this binding remain poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the functions of six kinetochore-bound MT-associated proteins (kMAPs) using RNAi, live-cell microscopy and quantitative image analysis. We find that RNAi-mediated depletion of two kMAPs, the adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC) and its binding partner, EB1, are unusual in affecting the movement and orientation of paired sister chromatids at the metaphase plate without perturbing kinetochore-MT attachment per se. Quantitative analysis shows that misorientation phenotypes in metaphase are uniform across chromatid pairs even though chromosomal loss (CIN) during anaphase is sporadic. However, errors in kinetochore function generated by APC or EB1 depletion are detected poorly if at all by the spindle checkpoint, even though they cause chromosome missegregation. We propose that impaired EB1 or APC function generates lesions invisible to the spindle checkpoint and thereby promotes low levels of CIN expected to fuel aneuploidy and possibly tumorigenesis.

The nature of the factors leading to the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) into its amyloidogenic isoform (PrP(Sc)) is still matter of debate in the field of structural biology. The NMR structures of non-mammalian PrP(C) (non-mPrP) from frog, chicken and turtle [Calzolai, L., Lysek, D.A., Perez, D.R., Guntert, P. and Wuthrich, K. (2005) Prion protein NMR structures of chickens, turtles, and frogs. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102, 651-655] have provided some new and valuable information on the scaffolding elements that preserve the PrP(C) folding, despite their low sequence identity with the mammalian prions (mPrP). The present molecular dynamics study of non-mPrP(C) focuses on the hydration properties of these proteins in comparison with the mammalian ones. The data reveal new insights in the PrP hydration and focus on the implications for PrP(C) folding stability and its propensity for interactions. In addition, for the first time, a role in disfavoring the PrP(C) aggregation is suggested for a conserved beta-bulge which is stabilized by the local hydration.

Suppression of Egr-1 transcription through targeting of the serum response factor by oncogenic H-Ras.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The transcription factor Egr-1 functions as a key regulator in cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The loss of Egr-1 expression is closely associated with tumor development, although the molecular mechanism behind the suppression of Egr-1 is largely unknown. In this report, we show that growth factor-induced transcriptional activation of Egr-1 gene is downregulated by chronic expression of oncogenic H-Ras in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Our results demonstrate that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling is necessary for oncogenic H-Ras-mediated reduction of Egr-1 gene expression. Aberrant activation of PI3K signaling by oncogenic Ras decreased the level of serum response factor (SRF) protein through the acceleration of proteolysis, which resulted in decreased SRF binding to the serum response element (SRE) sites within the Egr-1 promoter, leading to the suppression of Egr-1 transcription. Inhibition of PI3K signaling restored the downregulation of SRF and Egr-1 expression caused by oncogenic Ras. Our findings suggest a novel signaling mechanism by which prolonged activation of oncogenic H-Ras can trigger the loss of tumor suppressor Egr-1 through the PI3K pathway in NIH3T3 fibroblast model cell lines.

Notch targets the Cdk inhibitor Xic1 to regulate differentiation but not
the cell cycle in neurons.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The proneural protein neurogenin (XNGNR1) drives differentiation of primary neurons in combination with the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor Xic1. Differentiation is inhibited by Notch signalling, resulting in a scattered neuronal distribution. Here we show that Notch signalling regulates the level of Xic1 transcription, yet this does not correlate with Notch's ability to perturb the cell cycle. Instead, Notch may regulate Xic1 levels to control its differentiation function directly, which is required in parallel with XNGNR1 to promote primary neurogenesis. Indeed, Notch-mediated repression of both XNGNR1 and Xic1 must be relieved for neuronal differentiation to occur. Interestingly, although Xic1 is required for XNGNR1-mediated neurogenesis, it is not required for XNGNR1-mediated upregulation of Delta, allowing establishment of the negative feedback loop involved in lateral inhibition. Therefore, Notch targets Cdk inhibitor expression to regulate differentiation of primary neurons, and its effects on the cell cycle may be of secondary importance.

<ABSTRACT>
We have determined the human genome to contain 296 different Src homology-3 (SH3) domains and cloned them into a phage-display vector. This provided a powerful and unbiased system for simultaneous assaying of the complete human SH3 proteome for the strongest binding to target proteins of interest, without the limitations posed by short linear peptide ligands or confounding variables of more indirect methods for protein interaction screening. Studies involving three ligand proteins, human immunodeficiency virus-1 Nef, p21-activated kinase (PAK)2 and ADAM15, showed previously reported as well as novel SH3 partners with nanomolar affinities specific for them. This argues that SH3 domains may have a more dominant role in directing cellular protein interactions than has been assumed. Besides showing potentially important new SH3-directed interactions, these studies also led to the discovery of novel signalling proteins, such as the PAK2-binding adaptor protein POSH2 and the ADAM15-binding sorting nexin family member SNX30.

<ABSTRACT>
Tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)1 is the main receptor responsible for TNF-induced diverse cellular events. In this study, we report that TNFR1 has a crucial role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. Although ER stress leads to JNK activation in wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts, we failed to detect any JNK activation in TNFR1-/- cells. ER stress-induced JNK activation is restored in TNFR1-/- cells when TNFR1 expression is reconstituted. We also found that TNFR1 functions downstream of IRE1 and that IRE1 is present in the same complex with TNFR1 under ER stress condition. Therefore, our study shows a novel role of TNFR1 in mediating ER stress-induced JNK activation.

The role of AtMSH2 in homologous recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana.

<ABSTRACT>
During homologous recombination (HR), a heteroduplex DNA is formed as a consequence of strand invasion. When the two homologous strands differ in sequence, a mismatch is generated. Earlier studies showed that mismatched heteroduplex often triggers abortion of recombination and that a pivotal component of this pathway is the mismatch repair Msh2 protein. In this study, we analysed the roles of AtMSH2 in suppression of recombination in Arabidopsis. We report that AtMSH2 has a broad range of anti-recombination effects: it suppresses recombination between divergent direct repeats in somatic cells or between homologues from different ecotypes during meiosis. This is the first example of a plant gene that affects HR as a function of sequence divergence and that has an anti-recombination meiotic effect. We discuss the implications of these results for plant improvement by gene transfer across species.

<ABSTRACT>
We have utilized the differential display PCR method to isolate transcripts expressed during early embryogenesis of Xenopus laevis. Among many transcripts that have been found to be expressed differentially during the development, one transcript which was expressed predominantly in the unfertilized egg, was isolated as a full-length cDNA and the sequence was determined. This cDNA contained a predicted size of 198 amino acids. A search of the GenBank database revealed that the predicted amino acid sequence of the cDNA is highly homologous-87.8% identical-to the recently identified human protein, HsYKT6, a prenylated vesicle associated-SNARE ((soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein) attachment protein receptor)). Thus we have named the gene as Xsnare1. RT-PCR analysis showed that the Xsnare1 mRNA expressed throughout the oogenesis, in egg and in the early phase of embryogenesis and the level of expression declined after gastrulation. These results suggest that the Xsnare1, a maternally active, putative Xenopus homologue of prenylated v-SNARE, is a developmentally regulatory gene and may be play a role in the process of the early development of Xenopus laevis.

<ABSTRACT>
The genome of mitochondria encodes a small number of very hydrophobic polypeptides that are inserted into the inner membrane in a cotranslational reaction. The molecular process by which mitochondrial ribosomes are recruited to the membrane is poorly understood. Here, we show that the inner membrane protein Mba1 binds to the large subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes. It thereby cooperates with the C-terminal ribosome-binding domain of Oxa1, which is a central component of the insertion machinery of the inner membrane. In the absence of both Mba1 and the C-terminus of Oxa1, mitochondrial translation products fail to be properly inserted into the inner membrane and serve as substrates of the matrix chaperone Hsp70. We propose that Mba1 functions as a ribosome receptor that cooperates with Oxa1 in the positioning of the ribosome exit site to the insertion machinery of the inner membrane.

<ABSTRACT>
ATF2 and c-Jun are key components of activating protein-1 and function as homodimers or heterodimers. c-Jun-ATF2 heterodimers activate the expression of many target genes, including c-jun, in response to a variety of cellular and environmental signals. Although it has been believed that c-Jun and ATF2 are constitutively localized in the nucleus, where they are phosphorylated and activated by mitogen-activated protein kinases, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of their transcriptional activities remain to be defined. Here we show that ATF2 possesses a nuclear export signal in its leucine zipper region and two nuclear localization signals in its basic region, resulting in continuous shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Dimerization with c-Jun in the nucleus prevents the export of ATF2 and is essential for the transcriptional activation of the c-jun promoter. Importantly, c-Jun-dependent nuclear localization of ATF2 occurs during retinoic acid-induced differentiation and UV-induced cell death in F9 cells. Together, these findings demonstrate that ATF2 and c-Jun mutually regulate each other by altering the dynamics of subcellular localization and by positively impacting transcriptional activity.

<ABSTRACT>
Mono-glucosylation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 by Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB) induces changes of actin dynamics and apoptosis. When fibroblasts were treated with TcdB, an apparent decrease of the cellular Rac1 level was observed when applying anti-Rac1(Mab 102). This decrease was not based on degradation as inhibition of the proteasome by lactacystin did not stabilise cellular Rac1 levels. The application of anti-Rac1 (Mab 23A8) showed that the cellular Rac1 level slightly increased in TcdB-treated fibroblasts; thus, the apparent loss of cellular Rac1 was not due to degradation but due to impaired recognition of glucosylated Rac1 by anti-Rac1 (Mab 102). In contrast, recognition of RhoA by anti-RhoA (Mab 26C4) and Cdc42 by anti-Cdc42 (Mab 44) was not altered by glucosylation; a transient decrease of cellular RhoA and Cdc42 in TcdB-treated fibroblasts was indeed due to proteasomal degradation, as inhibition of the proteasome by lactacystin stabilised both cellular RhoA and Cdc42 levels. The finding that the apparent decrease of Rac1 reflects Rac1 glucosylation offers a valuable tool to determine Rac1 glucosylation.

<ABSTRACT>
The beta-catenin/Tcf complex is a downstream effector of the Wnt signalling pathway. It is a transcription complex, which activates gene expression and contributes to proliferation and tumor progression. Tcf1 in complex with beta-catenin is able to activate beta-catenin-dependent gene expression. We demonstrate that expressed Bcr is able to bind the transcription factor Tcf1 to disrupt the Tcf1/beta-catenin complex. Phosphorylation of Bcr by the tyrosine kinase pp60(src) can lead to dissociation of the transcriptionally inactive Bcr/Tcf1 complex. Thus two independent mechanisms may regulate Tcf/beta-catenin-mediated transcription via Bcr: binding to beta-catenin as we have previously shown and to Tcf1 as shown here.

<ABSTRACT>
Reducing end xylose-releasing exooligoxylanase (Rex, EC 3.2.1.156) is an inverting GH that hydrolyzes xylooligosaccharides (> or = X3) to release X1 at their reducing end. The wild-type enzyme exhibited the Hehre resynthesis hydrolysis mechanism, in which alpha-X2F was hydrolyzed to X2 and HF in the presence of X1 as an acceptor molecule. However, the transglycosidation product (X3) was not detectable in the reaction. To convert reducing end xylose-releasing exooligoxylanase to glycosynthase, derivatives with mutations in the catalytic base (Asp-263) were constructed by saturation random mutagenesis. Nine amino acid residue mutants (Asp-263 to Gly, Ala, Val, Thr, Leu, Asn, Cys, Pro, or Ser) were found to possess glycosynthase activity forming X3 from alpha-X2F and X1. Among them, D263C showed the highest level of X3 production, and D263N exhibited the fastest consumption of alpha-X2F. The D263C mutant showed 10-fold lower hydrolytic activity than D263N, resulting in the highest yield of X3. X2 was formed from the early stage of the reaction of the D263C mutant, indicating that a portion of the X3 formed by condensation was hydrolyzed before its release from the enzyme. To acquire glycosynthase activity from inverting enzymes, it is important to minimize the decrease in F(-)-releasing activity while maximizing the decrease in the hydrolytic activity. The present study expands the possibility of conversion of glycosynthases from inverting enzymes.

<ABSTRACT>
The Tec family kinases are critical downstream regulators of antigen receptor signals in lymphocytes. As kinases, they act on critical substrates to regulate signals such as calcium increase leading to activation of transcription factors such as NFAT, NFkappaB and SRF. We now show here that ITK, a member of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases, has a kinase independent function. Mutants of ITK that lack kinase activity or a kinase domain can rescue cells lacking Tec family kinases for antigen receptor induced SRF activation, but not for NFAT, AP-1 or NFkappaB activation. Furthermore, expression of these mutants in WT cells enhanced SRF activation. This kinase independent function required the SH2 domain since a mutant lacking both the kinase and SH2 domains was much less effective at rescuing SRF activation. This kinase-deleted mutant could partially rescue ERK activation, and interact with multiple tyrosine phosphorylated proteins during antigen receptor signaling, suggesting that ITK uses a scaffolding function that regulates signals leading to specific regulation of SRF activation.

<ABSTRACT>
Glycosylation is a key mechanism for orchestrating the bioactivity, metabolism and location of small molecules in living cells. In plants, a large multigene family of glycosyltransferases is involved in these processes, conjugating hormones, secondary metabolites, biotic and abiotic environmental toxins, to impact directly on cellular homeostasis. The red grape enzyme UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glycosyltransferase (VvGT1) is responsible for the formation of anthocyanins, the health-promoting compounds which, in planta, function as colourants determining flower and fruit colour and are precursors for the formation of pigmented polymers in red wine. We show that VvGT1 is active, in vitro, on a range of flavonoids. VvGT1 is somewhat promiscuous with respect to donor sugar specificity as dissected through full kinetics on a panel of nine sugar donors. The three-dimensional structure of VvGT1 has also been determined, both in its 'Michaelis' complex with a UDP-glucose-derived donor and the acceptor kaempferol and in complex with UDP and quercetin. These structures, in tandem with kinetic dissection of activity, provide the foundation for understanding the mechanism of these enzymes in small molecule homeostasis.

<ABSTRACT>
Recurrent chromosomal translocations involving the RAR alpha locus on chromosome 17 are the hallmark of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The RAR alpha gene fuses to variable partners (PML, PLZF, NPM, NuMA and STAT5B: X genes) leading to the expression of APL-specific fusion proteins with identical RAR alpha moieties. To analyse whether the variable X moiety could affect the activity of the fusion protein in vivo, we generated and characterized, on a comparative basis, NPM/RAR alpha transgenic mice (TM) in which the fusion gene is expressed under the control of a human Cathepsin G (hCG) minigene. We compared the features of the leukemia observed in these TM with those in hCG-PML/RAR alpha and hCG-PLZF/RAR alpha TM. In all three transgenic models, leukemia developed after a variably long latency, with variable penetrance. However, the three leukemias displayed distinct cytomorphological features. hCG-NPM/RAR alpha leukemic cells resembled monoblasts. This phenotype contrasts with what was observed in the hCG-PML/RAR alpha TM model in which the leukemic phase was characterized by the proliferation of promyelocytic blasts. Similarly, hCG-PLZF/RAR alpha TM displayed a different phenotype where terminally differentiated myeloid cells predominated. Importantly, the NPM/RAR alpha oncoprotein was found to localize in the nucleolus, unlike PML/RAR alpha and PLZF/RAR alpha, thus possibly interfering with the normal function of NPM. Similarly to what was observed in human APL patients, we found that NPM/RAR alpha and PML/RAR alpha, but not PLZF/RAR alpha leukemia, was responsive to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or As2O3 treatments. Taken together, our results underscore the critical relevance of the X moiety in dictating the biology of the disease and the activity of the APL fusion oncoprotein.

Chromogranin-mediated secretion of mutant superoxide dismutase proteins
linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

<ABSTRACT>
Here we report that chromogranins, components of neurosecretory vesicles, interact with mutant forms of superoxide dismutase (SOD1) that are linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but not with wild-type SOD1. This interaction was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid screen and by co-immunoprecipitation assays using either lysates from Neuro2a cells coexpressing chromogranins and SOD1 mutants or lysates from spinal cord of ALS mice. Confocal and immunoelectron microscopy revealed a partial colocalization of mutant SOD1 with chromogranins in spinal cord of ALS mice. Mutant SOD1 was also found in immuno-isolated trans-Golgi network and in microsome preparations, suggesting that it can be secreted. Indeed we report evidence that chromogranins may act as chaperone-like proteins to promote secretion of SOD1 mutants. From these results, and our finding that extracellular mutant SOD1 can trigger microgliosis and neuronal death, we propose a new ALS pathogenic model based on the toxicity of secreted SOD1 mutants.

The role of an upstream promoter interaction in initiation of bacterial
transcription.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) recognizes promoters through sequence-specific contacts of its promoter-specificity components (sigma) with two DNA sequence motifs. Contacts with the upstream ('-35') promoter motif are made by sigma domain 4 attached to the flap domain of the RNAP beta subunit. Bacteriophage T4 late promoters consist solely of an extended downstream ('-10') motif specifically recognized by the T4 gene 55 protein (gp55). Low level basal transcription is sustained by gp55-RNAP holoenzyme. The late transcription coactivator gp33 binds to the beta flap and represses this basal transcription. Gp33 can also repress transcription by Escherichia coli sigma70-RNAP holoenzyme mutated to allow gp33 access to the beta flap. We propose that repression is due to gp33 blocking an upstream sequence-independent DNA-binding site on RNAP (as sigma70 domain 4 does) but, unlike sigma70 domain 4, providing no new DNA interaction. We show that this upstream interaction is essential only at an early step of transcription initiation, and discuss the role of this interaction in promoter recognition and transcriptional regulation.

Mammalian Emi2 mediates cytostatic arrest and transduces the signal for
meiotic exit via Cdc20.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Fertilizable mammalian oocytes are arrested at the second meiotic metaphase (mII) by the cyclinB-Cdc2 heterodimer, maturation promoting factor (MPF). MPF is stabilized via the activity of an unidentified cytostatic factor (CSF), thereby suspending meiotic progression until fertilization. We here present evidence that a conserved 71 kDa mammalian orthologue of Xenopus XErp1/Emi2, which we term endogenous meiotic inhibitor 2 (Emi2) is an essential CSF component. Depletion in situ of Emi2 by RNA interference elicited precocious meiotic exit in maturing mouse oocytes. Reduction of Emi2 released mature mII oocytes from cytostatic arrest, frequently inducing cytodegeneration. Mos levels autonomously declined to undetectable levels in mII oocytes. Recombinant Emi2 reduced the propensity of mII oocytes to exit meiosis in response to activating stimuli. Emi2 and Cdc20 proteins mutually interact and Cdc20 ablation negated the ability of Emi2 removal to induce metaphase release. Consistent with this, Cdc20 removal prevented parthenogenetic or sperm-induced meiotic exit. These studies show in intact oocytes that the interaction of Emi2 with Cdc20 links activating stimuli to meiotic resumption at fertilization and during parthenogenesis in mammals.

<ABSTRACT>
Expression of androgen receptor (AR) in prostate epithelial cells is thought to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. However, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We report that re-expression of AR in PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line resulted in upregulation of IFI16 protein, a negative regulator of cell growth. We found that the IFI16 protein bound to AR in a ligand-dependent manner and the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the AR was sufficient to bind IFI16. Furthermore, re-expression of IFI16 protein in LNCaP prostate cancer cells, which do not express IFI16 protein, resulted in downregulation of AR expression and an inhibition of the expression of AR target genes. Our observations identify a role for IFI16 protein in AR-mediated functions.

<ABSTRACT>
Pax6 and c-Maf regulate multiple stages of mammalian lens development. Here, we identified novel distal control regions (DCRs) of the alphaA-crystallin gene, a marker of lens fiber cell differentiation induced by FGF-signaling. DCR1 stimulated reporter gene expression in primary lens explants treated with FGF2 linking FGF-signaling with alphaA-crystallin synthesis. A DCR1/alphaA-crystallin promoter (including DCR2) coupled with EGFP virtually recapitulated the expression pattern of alphaA-crystallin in lens epithelium and fibers. In contrast, the DCR3/alphaA/EGFP reporter was expressed only in 'late' lens fibers. Chromatin immunoprecipitations showed binding of Pax6 to DCR1 and the alphaA-crystallin promoter in lens chromatin and demonstrated that high levels of alphaA-crystallin expression correlate with increased binding of c-Maf and CREB to the promoter and of CREB to DCR3, a broad domain of histone H3K9-hyperacetylation extending from DCR1 to DCR3, and increased abundance of chromatin remodeling enzymes Brg1 and Snf2h at the alphaA-crystallin locus. Our data demonstrate a novel mechanism of Pax6, c-Maf and CREB function, through regulation of chromatin-remodeling enzymes, and suggest a multistage model for the activation of alphaA-crystallin during lens differentiation.

AIFsh, a novel apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) pro-apoptotic isoform with
potential pathological relevance in human cancer.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
AIF is a main mediator of caspase-independent cell death. It is encoded by a single gene located on chromosome X, region q25-26 and A6 in humans and mice, respectively. Previous studies established that AIF codes for two isoforms of the protein, AIF and AIF-exB. Here, we identify a third AIF isoform resulting from an alternate transcriptional start site located at intron 9 of AIF. The resulting mRNA encodes a cytosolic protein that corresponds to the C-terminal domain of AIF (amino acids 353-613). We named this new isoform AIFshort (AIFsh). AIFsh overexpression in HeLa cells results in nuclear translocation and caspase-independent cell death. Once in the nucleus, AIFsh provokes the same effects than AIF, namely chromatin condensation and large scale (50 kb) DNA fragmentation. In contrast, these apoptogenic effects are not precluded by the AIF-inhibiting protein Hsp70. These findings identify AIFsh as a new pro-apoptotic isoform of AIF, and also reveal that the first N-terminal 352 amino acids of AIF are not required for its apoptotic activity. In addition, we demonstrate that AIFsh is strongly down-regulated in tumor cells derived from kidney, vulva, skin, thyroid, and pancreas, whereas, gamma-irradiation treatment provokes AIFsh up-regulation. Overall, our results identify a novel member of the AIF-dependent pathway and shed new light on the role of caspase-independent cell death in tumor formation/suppression.

<ABSTRACT>
The P2X(7) receptor is a ligand-gated cation channel that is highly expressed on mononuclear leukocytes and that mediates ATP-induced apoptosis and killing of intracellular pathogens. There is a wide variation in P2X(7) receptor function between subjects, explained in part by four loss-of-function polymorphisms (R307Q, E496A, I568N, and a 5'-intronic splice site polymorphism), as well as rare mutations. In this study, we report the allele frequencies of 11 non-synonymous P2X(7) polymorphisms and describe a fifth loss-of-function polymorphism in the gene (1096C --> G), which changes Thr(357) to Ser (T357S) with an allele frequency of 0.08 in the Caucasian population. P2X(7) function was measured by ATP-induced ethidium(+) influx into peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes and, when compared with wild-type subjects, was reduced to 10-65% in heterozygotes, 1-18% in homozygotes, and 0-10% in compound heterozygotes carrying T357S and a second loss-of-function polymorphism. Overexpression of the T357S mutant P2X(7) in either HEK-293 cells or Xenopus oocytes gave P2X(7) function of approximately 50% that of wild-type constructs. Differentiation of monocytes to macrophages, which also up-regulates P2X(7), restored P2X(7) function to near normal in cells heterozygous for T357S and to a value 50-65% of wild-type in cells homozygous for T357S or compound heterozygous for T357S/E496A. However, macrophages from subjects that are compound heterozygous for either T357S/R307Q or T357S/stop codon had near-to-absent P2X(7) function. These functional deficits induced by T357S were paralleled by impaired ATP-induced apoptosis and mycobacteria killing in macrophages from these subjects. Lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages from subjects homozygous for T357S or compound heterozygous for T357S and a second loss-of-function allele have reduced or absent P2X(7) receptor function.

Deficiency of disulfide bonds facilitating fibrillogenesis of endostatin.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Endostatin is an endogenous inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. It has two pairs of disulfide bonds in a unique nested pattern, which play a key role in its native conformation, stability, and activity. Here, we constructed a disulfide-deficient variant of endostatin, endo-all-Ala, to examine the effects of the two disulfide bonds on fibrillogenesis of endostatin under nondenaturing conditions. Based on thioflavin T fluorescence, atomic force microscopy, far-UV circular dichroism, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, we found that endo-all-Ala, which has a higher alpha-helical content compared with wild type, is prone to forming fibrils in a pH-dependent manner. Subsequently, more hydrophobic patches with a lower stability of endo-all-Ala were observed when compared with wild type, which possibly contributes to the propensity of amyloid formation of endo-all-Ala. To our surprise, the significant increase of the alpha-helical content in endostatin induced by trifluoroethanol can also facilitate fibril formation. In addition, the cytotoxicity of fibrillar aggregates of endo-all-Ala, which were generated at different stages of the fibril formation process, was evaluated by cell viability assay. The results indicate that the cytotoxicity is not due to the fibrils but rather due to the granular aggregates of endo-all-Ala. Moreover, endostatin was interestingly found to be reduced by glutathione at physiological concentrations. Our present work not only elucidates the correlation between the existence of disulfide bonds and the fibril formation of endostatin but also may provide some insights into the structural and functional basis of endostatin in Alzheimer disease brains.

G-protein-coupled OX1 orexin/hcrtr-1 hypocretin receptors induce
caspase-dependent and -independent cell death through p38
mitogen-/stress-activated protein kinase.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have investigated the signaling of OX(1) receptors to cell death using Chinese hamster ovary cells as a model system. OX(1) receptor stimulation with orexin-A caused a delayed cell death independently of cytosolic Ca(2+) elevation. The classical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, ERK and p38, were strongly activated by orexin-A. p38 was essential for induction of cell death, whereas the ERK pathway appeared protective. A pathway often implicated in the p38-mediated cell death, activation of p53, did not mediate the cell death, as there was no stabilization of p53 or increase in p53-dependent transcriptional activity, and dominant-negative p53 constructs did not inhibit cell demise. Under basal conditions, orexin-A-induced cell death was associated with compact chromatin condensation and it required de novo gene transcription and protein synthesis, the classical hallmarks of programmed (apoptotic) cell death. However, though the pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(O-methyl)fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) fully inhibited the caspase activity, it did not rescue the cells from orexin-A-induced death. In the presence of Z-VAD-fmk, orexin-A-induced cell death was still dependent on p38 and de novo protein synthesis, but it no longer required gene transcription. Thus, caspase inhibition causes activation of alternative, gene transcription-independent death pathway. In summary, the present study points out mechanisms for orexin receptor-mediated cell death and adds to our general understanding of the role of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling in cell death by suggesting a pathway from G-protein-coupled receptors to cell death via p38 mitogen-/stress-activated protein kinase independent of p53 and caspase activation.

Amino and carboxyl termini are unique positions in a polypeptide. They tend to be exposed in folded three dimensional structures. Diversity and functional significance of C-terminal sequences have been appreciated from studies of PDZ and PEX domains. Signaling 14-3-3 protein signaling by recognizing phosphorylated peptides plays a critical role in a variety of biological processes, including oncogenesis. The preferential binding of 14-3-3 to phosphorylated C-terminal sequences, mode III, provides a means of regulated binding and considerably expands the substrate repertoire of 14-3-3 interaction partners.

Y-family DNA polymerases respond to DNA damage-independent inhibition of
replication fork progression.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In Escherichia coli, the Y-family DNA polymerases Pol IV (DinB) and Pol V (UmuD2'C) enhance cell survival upon DNA damage by bypassing replication-blocking DNA lesions. We report a unique function for these polymerases when DNA replication fork progression is arrested not by exogenous DNA damage, but with hydroxyurea (HU), thereby inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, and bringing about damage-independent DNA replication stalling. Remarkably, the umuC122::Tn5 allele of umuC, dinB, and certain forms of umuD gene products endow E. coli with the ability to withstand HU treatment (HUR). The catalytic activities of the UmuC122 and DinB proteins are both required for HUR. Moreover, the lethality brought about by such stalled replication forks in the wild-type derivatives appears to proceed through the toxin/antitoxin pairs mazEF and relBE. This novel function reveals a role for Y-family polymerases in enhancing cell survival under conditions of nucleotide starvation, in addition to their established functions in response to DNA damage.

<ABSTRACT>
Telomeric DNA can fold into four-stranded structures known as G-quadruplexes. Here we investigate the ability of G-quadruplex DNA to serve as a substrate for recombinant Tetrahymena and native Euplotes telomerase. Inter- and intramolecular G-quadruplexes were gel-purified and their stability examined using native gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism (CD) and thermal denaturation. While intermolecular G-quadruplexes were highly stable, they were excellent substrates for both ciliate telomerases in primer extension assays. In contrast, intramolecular G-quadruplexes formed in K+ exhibited biphasic unfolding and were not extended by ciliate telomerases. Na+-stabilised intramolecular G-quadruplexes were extended by telomerase owing to their rapid rate of dissociation. The Tetrahymena telomerase protein component bound to inter- but not intramolecular K+-stabilised G-quadruplexes. This study provides evidence that parallel intermolecular G-quadruplexes can serve as substrates for telomerase in vitro, their extension being mediated through direct interactions between this higher-order structure and telomerase.

Grabbing the message: structural basis of mRNA 3'UTR recognition by Hrp1.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The recognition of specific signals encoded within the 3'-untranslated region of the newly transcribed mRNA triggers the assembly of a multiprotein machine that modifies its 3'-end. Hrp1 recognises one of such signals, the so-called polyadenylation enhancement element (PEE), promoting the recruitment of other polyadenylation factors in yeast. The molecular bases of this interaction are revealed here by the solution structure of a complex between Hrp1 and an oligonucleotide mimicking the PEE. Six consecutive bases (AUAUAU) are specifically recognised by two RNA-binding domains arranged in tandem. Both protein and RNA undergo significant conformational changes upon complex formation with a concomitant large surface burial of RNA bases. Key aspects of RNA specificity can be explained by the presence of intermolecular aromatic-aromatic contacts and hydrogen bonds. Altogether, the Hrp1-PEE structure represents one of the first steps towards understanding of the assembly of the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery at the atomic level.

Chromatin organization and cell fate switch respond to positional
information in Arabidopsis.

<ABSTRACT>
Many types of plant cell retain their developmental plasticity and have the capacity to switch fate when exposed to a new source of positional information. In the root epidermis of Arabidopsis, cells differentiate in alternating files of hair cells and non-hair cells, in response to positional information and the activity of the homoeodomain transcription factor GLABRA2 (GL2) in future non-hair cells. Here we show by three-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization on intact root epidermal tissue that alternative states of chromatin organization around the GL2 locus are required to control position-dependent cell-type specification. When, as a result of an atypical cell division, a cell is displaced from a hair file into a non-hair file, it switches fate. We show that during this event the chromatin state around the GL2 locus is not inherited, but is reorganized in the G1 phase of the cell cycle in response to local positional information. This ability to remodel chromatin organization may provide the basis for the plasticity in plant cell fate changes.

Deletion of YOR090c, encoding a putative mitochondrial phosphatase, results in a decreased PDH activity, indicating that Yor090cp acts as the corresponding PDH phosphatase. We demonstrate by means of blue native gel electrophoresis and tandem affinity purification that both enzymes are associated with the PDH complex.

Mechanism of uptake of C105Y, a novel cell-penetrating peptide.

<ABSTRACT>
C105Y, a synthetic peptide (CSIPPEVKFNKPFVYLI) based on the amino acid sequence corresponding to residues 359-374 of alpha1-antitrypsin, enhances gene expression from DNA nanoparticles. To investigate how this enhancement occurs, C105Y was fluorescently labeled to study its uptake and intracellular trafficking. When human hepatoma cells (HuH7) were incubated with fluorescently labeled C105Y for as little as 3 min, C105Y displayed nuclear and cytoplasmic staining with enrichment of fluorescent signal in the nucleus and nucleolus. Uptake and nucleolar localization were observed with the short sequence PFVYLI, but not with SIPPEVKFNK, and the D-isomer was readily taken up into cells but not into the nucleus. We found that the C105Y peptide is routed to the nucleolus very rapidly in an energy-dependent fashion, whereas membrane translocation and nuclear localization are energy-independent. When we tested the involvement of known endocytosis pathways in uptake and trafficking of this peptide, we demonstrated that C105Y peptide is internalized by a clathrin- and caveolin-independent pathway, although lipid raft-mediated endocytosis may play a role in peptide intracellular trafficking. Efficient energy-independent cell entry with rapid nuclear localization probably accounts for enhancement of gene expression from inclusion of C105Y into DNA nanoparticles.

Antithrombin-S195A factor Xa-heparin structure reveals the allosteric
mechanism of antithrombin activation.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Regulation of blood coagulation is critical for maintaining blood flow, while preventing excessive bleeding or thrombosis. One of the principal regulatory mechanisms involves heparin activation of the serpin antithrombin (AT). Inhibition of several coagulation proteases is accelerated by up to 10,000-fold by heparin, either through bridging AT and the protease or by inducing allosteric changes in the properties of AT. The anticoagulant effect of short heparin chains, including the minimal AT-specific pentasaccharide, is mediated exclusively through the allosteric activation of AT towards efficient inhibition of coagulation factors (f) IXa and Xa. Here we present the crystallographic structure of the recognition (Michaelis) complex between heparin-activated AT and S195A fXa, revealing the extensive exosite contacts that confer specificity. The heparin-induced conformational change in AT is required to allow simultaneous contacts within the active site and two distinct exosites of fXa (36-loop and the autolysis loop). This structure explains the molecular basis of protease recognition by AT, and the mechanism of action of the important therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparins.

<ABSTRACT>
Immune responses are initiated when molecules of microbial origin are sensed by the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We now report the identification of essential molecular components for the trafficking of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor complex. LPS was endocytosed by a receptor-mediated mechanism dependent on dynamin and clathrin and colocalized with TLR4 on early/sorting endosomes. TLR4 was ubiquitinated and associated with the ubiquitin-binding endosomal sorting protein hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate, Hrs. Inhibition of endocytosis and endosomal sorting increased LPS signaling. Finally, the LPS receptor complex was sorted to late endosomes/lysosomes for degradation and loading of associated antigens onto HLA class II molecules for presentation to CD4+ T cells. Our results show that endosomal trafficking of the LPS receptor complex is essential for signal termination and LPS-associated antigen presentation, thus controlling both innate and adaptive immunity through TLR4.

<ABSTRACT>
Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) plays a pivotal role in transepithelial Na+ and HCO3(-) absorption across a wide range of epithelia in the digestive and renal-genitourinary systems. Accumulating evidence suggests that PDZ-based adaptor proteins play an important role in regulating the trafficking and activity of NHE3. A search for NHE3-binding modular proteins using yeast two-hybrid assays led us to the PDZ-based adaptor Shank2. The interaction between Shank2 and NHE3 was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance studies. When expressed in PS120/NHE3 cells, Shank2 increased the membrane expression and basal activity of NHE3 and attenuated the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3 activity. Furthermore, knock-down of native Shank2 expression in Caco-2 epithelial cells by RNA interference decreased NHE3 protein expression as well as activity but amplified the inhibitory effect of cAMP on NHE3. These results indicate that Shank2 is a novel NHE3 interacting protein that is involved in the fine regulation of transepithelial salt and water transport through affecting NHE3 expression and activity.

<ABSTRACT>
Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) regulate apoptosis primarily by inhibiting caspase-family proteases. However, many IAPs also possess E3 ligase (ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase) activities implicated in both caspase-dependent and -independent functions of these proteins. Here, we compared the structural features of cIAP1 responsible for its interactions with two known target proteins, TRAF2 and SMAC. The N-terminal (BIR1) and C-terminal (BIR3) BIR domains of cIAP1 were determined to be necessary and sufficient for binding TRAF2 and SMAC, respectively. Mutational analysis of the BIR1 and BIR3 domains identified critical residues required for TRAF2 and SMAC binding. Using these mutants, cIAP1-mediated ubiquitination of TRAF2 and SMAC in vitro was determined to be correspondingly dependent on intact binding sites on BIR1 and BIR3. Because TRAF2 regulates NF-kappaB activation, the effects of cIAP1 on TRAF2-mediated induction of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity were studied using reporter gene assays. Expression of a fragment of cIAP1 encompassing the three BIR domains (but not full-length cIAP1) greatly enhanced TRAF2-induced increases in NF-kappaB activity, providing a convenient assay for monitoring BIR-dependent effects of cIAP1 on TRAF2 in cells. BIR1 mutants of the BIR1-3 fragment of cIAP1 that failed to bind TRAF2 lost the ability to modulate NF-kappaB activity, demonstrating a requirement for BIR1-mediated interactions with TRAF2. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the modularity and diversification of BIR domains, showing that a single cIAP can direct its E3 ligase activity toward different substrates and can alter the cellular functions of different protein targets in accordance with differences in the specificity of individual BIR domains.

Rescue of functional delF508-CFTR channels in cystic fibrosis epithelial

<ABSTRACT>
In the disease cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common mutation delF508 results in endoplasmic reticulum retention of misfolded CF gene proteins (CFTR). We show that the alpha-1,2-glucosidase inhibitor miglustat (N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, NB-DNJ) prevents delF508-CFTR/calnexin interaction and restores cAMP-activated chloride current in epithelial CF cells. Moreover, miglustat rescues a mature and functional delF508-CFTR in the intestinal crypts of ileal mucosa from delF508 mice. Since miglustat is an orally active orphan drug (Zavesca) prescribed for the treatment of Gaucher disease, our findings provide the basis for future clinical evaluation of miglustat in CF patients.

Adaptor protein controlled oligomerization activates the AAA+ protein
ClpC.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The AAA+ protein ClpC is not only involved in the removal of misfolded and aggregated proteins but also controls, through regulated proteolysis, key steps of several developmental processes in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. In contrast to other AAA+ proteins, ClpC is unable to mediate these processes without an adaptor protein like MecA. Here, we demonstrate that the general activation of ClpC is based upon the ability of MecA to participate in the assembly of an active and substrate-recognizing higher oligomer consisting of ClpC and the adaptor protein, which is a prerequisite for all activities of this AAA+ protein. Using hybrid proteins of ClpA and ClpC, we identified the N-terminal and the Linker domain of the first AAA+ domain of ClpC as the essential MecA interaction sites. This new adaptor-mediated mechanism adds another layer of control to the regulation of the biological activity of AAA+ proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Apolipoprotein (apo)E plays a critical role in cholesterol transport, through high affinity binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor. This interaction requires apoE to be associated with a lipoprotein particle. To determine the structure of biologically active apoE on a lipoprotein particle, we crystallized dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine particles containing two apoE molecules and determined the molecular envelope of apoE at 10 Angstroms resolution. On the basis of the molecular envelope and supporting biochemical evidence, we propose a model in which each apoE molecule is folded into a helical hairpin with the binding region for the low density lipoprotein receptor at its apex.

The calmodulin pathway and evolution of elongated beak morphology in
Darwin's finches.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A classic textbook example of adaptive radiation under natural selection is the evolution of 14 closely related species of Darwin's finches (Fringillidae, Passeriformes), whose primary diversity lies in the size and shape of their beaks. Thus, ground finches have deep and wide beaks, cactus finches have long and pointed beaks (low depth and narrower width), and warbler finches have slender and pointed beaks, reflecting differences in their respective diets. Previous work has shown that even small differences in any of the three major dimensions (depth, width and length) of the beak have major consequences for the overall fitness of the birds. Recently we used a candidate gene approach to explain one pathway involved in Darwin's finch beak morphogenesis. However, this type of analysis is limited to molecules with a known association with craniofacial and/or skeletogenic development. Here we use a less constrained, complementary DNA microarray analysis of the transcripts expressed in the beak primordia to find previously unknown genes and pathways whose expression correlates with specific beak morphologies. We show that calmodulin (CaM), a molecule involved in mediating Ca2+ signalling, is expressed at higher levels in the long and pointed beaks of cactus finches than in more robust beak types of other species. We validated this observation with in situ hybridizations. When this upregulation of the CaM-dependent pathway is artificially replicated in the chick frontonasal prominence, it causes an elongation of the upper beak, recapitulating the beak morphology of the cactus finches. Our results indicate that local upregulation of the CaM-dependent pathway is likely to have been a component of the evolution of Darwin's finch species with elongated beak morphology and provide a mechanistic explanation for the independence of beak evolution along different axes. More generally, our results implicate the CaM-dependent pathway in the developmental regulation of craniofacial skeletal structures.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) plays a crucial role in triggering cell division. To initiate this process, PI3K induces two distinct routes, of which one promotes cell growth and the other regulates cyclin-dependent kinases. Fine-tuned PI3K regulation is also required for later cell cycle phases. Here, we review the multiple points at which PI3K controls cell division and discuss its impact on human cancer.

<ABSTRACT>
Patients suffering from Refsum disease have a defect in the alpha-oxidation pathway which results in the accumulation of phytanic acid in plasma and tissues. Our previous studies have shown that phytanic acid is also a substrate for the omega-oxidation pathway. With the use of specific inhibitors we now show that members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) family 4 class are responsible for phytanic acid omega-hydroxylation. Incubations with microsomes containing human recombinant CYP450s (Supersomes) revealed that multiple CYP450 enzymes of the family 4 class are able to omega-hydroxylate phytanic acid with the following order of efficiency: CYP4F3A>CYP4F3B>CYP4F2>CYP4A11.

Geophysics: hot fluids or rock in eclogite metamorphism?
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The mechanisms by which mafic rocks become converted to denser eclogite in the lower crust and mantle are fundamental to our understanding of subduction, mountain building and the long-term geochemical evolution of Earth. Based on larger-than-expected gradients in argon isotopes, Camacho et al. propose a new explanation--co-seismic injection of hot (700 degrees C) aqueous fluids into much colder (400 degrees C) crust--for the localized nature of eclogite metamorphism during Caledonian crustal thickening, as recorded in the rocks of Holsnoy in the Bergen arcs, western Norway. We have studied these unusual rocks, which were thoroughly dehydrated under granulite facies conditions during a Neoproterozoic event (about 945 million years (945 Myr) ago); we also concluded that fracture-hosted fluids were essential as catalysts and components in the conversion to eclogite about 425 Myr ago. However, we are sceptical of the assertion by Camacho et al. that eclogite temperatures were reached only in the vicinity of fluid-filled fractures. Determining whether these rocks were strong enough to fracture at depths of 50 km because they were cold or because they were very dry is crucial to understanding the mechanics of the lower crust in mountain belts, including, for example, the causes of seismicity in the Indian plate beneath the modern Himalayas.

Caspases target only two architectural components within the core

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Caspases were recently implicated in the functional impairment of the nuclear pore complex during apoptosis, affecting its dual activity as nucleocytoplasmic transport channel and permeability barrier. Concurrently, electron microscopic data indicated that nuclear pore morphology is not overtly altered in apoptotic cells, raising the question of how caspases may deactivate nuclear pore function while leaving its overall structure largely intact. To clarify this issue we have analyzed the fate of all known nuclear pore proteins during apoptotic cell death. Our results show that only two of more than 20 nuclear pore core structure components, namely Nup93 and Nup96, are caspase targets. Both proteins are cleaved near their N terminus, disrupting the domains required for interaction with other nucleoporins actively involved in transport and providing the permeability barrier but dispensable for maintaining the nuclear pore scaffold. Caspase-mediated proteolysis of only few nuclear pore complex components may exemplify a general strategy of apoptotic cells to efficiently disable huge macromolecular machines.

Phosphorylated alpha-actinin and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B
coregulate the disassembly of the focal adhesion kinase x Src complex and
promote cell migration.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key regulator of cell migration. Phosphorylation at Tyr-397 activates FAK and creates a binding site for Src family kinases. FAK phosphorylates the cytoskeletal protein alpha-actinin at Tyr-12. Here we report that protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP 1B) is an alpha-actinin phosphatase. PTP 1B-dependent dephosphorylation of alpha-actinin was seen in COS-7 cells and PTP 1B-null fibroblasts reconstituted with PTP 1B. Furthermore, we show that coexpression of wild-type alpha-actinin and PTP 1B causes dephosphorylation at Tyr-397 in FAK. No dephosphorylation was observed in cells coexpressing the alpha-actinin phosphorylation mutant Y12F and PTP 1B. Furthermore, the phosphorylation at four other sites in FAK was not altered by PTP 1B. In addition, we found that phosphorylated alpha-actinin bound to Src and reduced the binding of FAK to Src. The dephosphorylation at Tyr-397 in FAK triggered by wild-type alpha-actinin and PTP 1B caused a significant increase in cell migration. We propose that phosphorylated alpha-actinin disrupts the FAK x Src complex exposing Tyr-397 in FAK to PTP 1B. These findings uncover a novel feedback loop involving phosphorylated alpha-actinin and PTP 1B that regulates FAK x Src interaction and cell migration.

Chaperone network in the yeast cytosol: Hsp110 is revealed as an Hsp70
nucleotide exchange factor.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Hsp110 proteins, exclusively found in the eukaryotic cytosol, have significant sequence homology to the Hsp70 molecular chaperone superfamily. Despite this homology and the cellular abundance of these proteins, the precise functional role has remained undefined. Here, we present the intriguing finding that the yeast homologue, Sse1p, acts as an efficient nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) for both yeast cytosolic Hsp70s, Ssa1p and Ssb1p. The mechanism involves formation of a stable nucleotide-sensitive complex, but does not require ATP hydrolysis by Sse1p. The NEF activity of Sse1p stimulates in vitro Ssa1p-mediated refolding of thermally denatured luciferase, and appears to have an essential role in vivo. Overexpression of the only other described cytosolic NEF, Fes1p, can partially compensate for a lethal sse1,2Delta phenotype, however, the cells are sensitive to stress conditions. Furthermore, in the absence of Sse, the in vivo refolding of thermally denatured model proteins is affected. This is the first report of a nucleotide exchange activity for the Hsp110 class of proteins, and provides a key piece in the puzzle of the cellular chaperone network.

<ABSTRACT>
Activation of ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases triggers multiple signaling pathways that regulate cellular proliferation and survival. We here demonstrate that ErbB2 is activated via the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) upon exposure of cultured human keratinocytes to 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (menadione). Both ErbB2 and EGFR are shown to be regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatases that are inhibited by menadione, giving rise to the hypothesis that phosphatase inhibition by menadione may result in a net activation of EGFR and an enhanced ErbB2 phosphorylation. Isolated PTP-1B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase known to be associated with ErbB receptors, is demonstrated to be inhibited by menadione.

Phosphorylation of Hsl1 by Hog1 leads to a G2 arrest essential for cell
survival at high osmolarity.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Control of cell cycle progression by stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) is essential for cell adaptation to extracellular stimuli. Exposure of yeast to osmostress leads to activation of the Hog1 SAPK, which controls cell cycle at G1 by the targeting of Sic1. Here, we show that survival to osmostress also requires regulation of G2 progression. Activated Hog1 interacts and directly phosphorylates a residue within the Hsl7-docking site of the Hsl1 checkpoint kinase, which results in delocalization of Hsl7 from the septin ring and leads to Swe1 accumulation. Upon Hog1 activation, cells containing a nonphosphorylatable Hsl1 by Hog1 are unable to promote Hsl7 delocalization, fail to arrest at G2 and become sensitive to osmostress. Together, we present a novel mechanism that regulates the Hsl1-Hsl7 complex to integrate stress signals to mediate cell cycle arrest and, demonstrate that a single MAPK coordinately modulates different cell cycle checkpoints to improve cell survival upon stress.

<ABSTRACT>
The B30.2/SPRY domain is present in approximately 700 eukaryotic (approximately 150 human) proteins, including medically important proteins such as TRIM5alpha and Pyrin. Nonetheless, the functional role of this modular domain remained unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of an SPRY-SOCS box family protein GUSTAVUS in complex with Elongins B and C, revealing a highly distorted two-layered beta-sandwich core structure of its B30.2/SPRY domain. Ensuing studies identified one end of the beta-sandwich as the surface interacting with an RNA helicase VASA with a 40 nM dissociation constant. The sequence variation in TRIM5alpha responsible for HIV-1 restriction and most of the mutations in Pyrin causing familial Mediterranean fever map on this surface, implicating the corresponding region in many B30.2/SPRY domains as the ligand-binding site. The amino acids lining the binding surface are highly variable among the B30.2/SPRY domains, suggesting that these domains are protein-interacting modules, which recognize a specific individual partner protein rather than a consensus sequence motif.

A single amino acid substitution in the activation loop defines the decoy
characteristic of VEGFR-1/FLT-1.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
VEGFR-1 is a kinase-defective receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and negatively modulates angiogenesis by acting as a decoy receptor. The decoy characteristic of VEGFR-1 is required for normal development and angiogenesis. To date, there is no molecular explanation for this unusual characteristic of VEGFR-1. Here we show that the molecular mechanisms underlying the decoy characteristic of VEGFR-1 is linked to the replacement of a highly conserved amino acid residue in the activation loop. This amino acid is highly conserved among all the type III RTKs and corresponds to aspartic acid, but in VEGFR-1 it is substituted to asparagine. Mutation of asparagine (Asn(1050)) within the activation loop to aspartic acid promoted enhanced ligand-dependent tyrosine autophosphorylation and kinase activation in vivo and in vitro. The mutant VEGFR-1 (Asp(1050)) promoted endothelial cell proliferation but not tubulogenesis. It also displayed an oncogenic phenotype as its expression in fibroblast cells elicited transformation and colony growth. Furthermore, mutation of the invariable aspartic acid to asparagine in VEGFR-2 lowered the autophosphorylation of activation loop tyrosines 1052 and 1057. We propose that the conserved aspartic acid in the activation loop favors the transphosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines, and its absence renders RTK to a less potent enzyme by disfavoring transphosphorylation of activation loop tyrosines.

GIT2 represses Crk- and Rac1-regulated cell spreading and Cdc42-mediated
focal adhesion turnover.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
G protein-coupled receptor kinase interactors (GITs) regulate focal adhesion (FA) turnover, cell spreading, and motility through direct interaction with paxillin and the Rac-exchange factor Pak-interacting exchange factor beta (betaPIX). However, it is not clear whether GITs function to activate or repress motility or if the predominant GIT forms, GIT1 and GIT2, serve distinct or redundant roles. Here we demonstrate an obligatory role for endogenous GIT2 in repression of lamellipodial extension and FA turnover by Rac1- and Cdc42-dependent signaling pathways, respectively. Moreover, we show that the SH2-SH3 adaptor protein Crk is an essential target of GIT2 inhibition. Unexpectedly, we find that betaPIX is dispensable for the effects elicited by knockdown of GIT2. Finally, we show that loss of GIT2 is sufficient to induce migration of the nontransformed epithelial cell line MCF10A. These results suggest that inactivation of GIT2 function is a required step for induction of cell motility and that GIT2 may be a target of oncogenic signaling pathways that regulate cell migration.

Determinants of conformational dimerization of Mad2 and its inhibition by
p31comet.

<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) monitors chromosome attachment to spindle microtubules. SAC proteins operate at kinetochores, scaffolds mediating chromosome-microtubule attachment. The ubiquitous SAC constituents Mad1 and Mad2 are recruited to kinetochores in prometaphase. Mad2 sequesters Cdc20 to prevent its ability to mediate anaphase onset. Its function is counteracted by p31comet (formerly CMT2). Upon binding Cdc20, Mad2 changes its conformation from O-Mad2 (Open) to C-Mad2 (Closed). A Mad1-bound C-Mad2 template, to which O-Mad2 binds prior to being converted into Cdc20-bound C-Mad2, assists this process. A molecular understanding of this prion-like property of Mad2 is missing. We characterized the molecular determinants of the O-Mad2:C-Mad2 conformational dimer and derived a rationalization of the binding interface in terms of symmetric and asymmetric components. Mutation of individual interface residues abrogates the SAC in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. NMR chemical shift perturbations indicate that O-Mad2 undergoes a major conformational rearrangement upon binding C-Mad2, suggesting that dimerization facilitates the structural conversion of O-Mad2 required to bind Cdc20. We also show that the negative effects of p31comet on the SAC are based on its competition with O-Mad2 for C-Mad2 binding.

<ABSTRACT>
Transcriptional activity relies on coregulators that modify chromatin structure or serve as bridging factors between transcription factors and the basal transcription machinery. We identified a new coregulator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, BRG1/Brm-associated factor of 60 kDa, subunit c2 (BAF60c2), in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human adipose tissue cDNA library. BAF60c2 represents a new isoform of BAF60c, a component of the SWI/SNF (mating type switching/sucrose non-fermenting) chromatin remodeling complex. This new isoform as well as the previously identified protein, renamed BAF60c1, is localized primarily in the cell nucleus and is expressed in a wide variety of tissues. Both BAF60c isoforms bind to several nuclear receptors and transcription factors of various families. BAF60c proteins interact in a ligand-independent manner with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and enhance its transcriptional activity. Both isoforms are enriched in the central nervous system and also modulate the transcriptional activity of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha1. In conclusion, BAF60c represents a new coregulator that constitutes an important anchoring point by which the SWI/SNF complex is recruited to nuclear receptors and other transcription factors.

Kidney claudin-19: localization in distal tubules and collecting ducts and

<ABSTRACT>
Tight junction (TJ) constitutes the barrier by controlling the passage of ions and molecules via paracellular pathway and the movement of proteins and lipids between apical and basolateral domains of the plasma membrane. Claudins, occludin, and junctional adhesion molecules are the major three transmembrane proteins at TJ. This study focuses a newly identified mammalian TJ gene, claudin-19, in kidneys. Mouse claudin-19 composes of 224 amino acids and shares 98.2% and 95% amino acid homology with rat and human, respectively; the most evolutionary-related claudins are claudin-1 and -7, which share approximately 75% DNA sequence homology with claudin-19. Claudin-19 is abundantly expressed in the mouse and rat kidneys among the organs examined by Northern blots, and to a much less extent, also found in brain by RT-PCR. Claudin-19 and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) are localized at junctional regions of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells by immunofluorescent microscopy. In addition, ZO-1 is found in the claudin-19-associated protein complexes in MDCK cells by co-immunoprecipitation. Using aquaporin-1 and aquaporin-2 antibodies as markers for different renal segment, strong expression of claudin-19 was observed in distal tubules of the cortex as well as in the collecting ducts of the medulla. To less extent, claudin-19 is also present in the proximal tubules (cortex) and in the loop of Henle (medulla). Furthermore, intense claudin-19 immunoreactivity is found co-localized with the ZO-1 in kidneys from postnatal day 15, day 45, and adult rats and mice. Similar localizations of claudin-19 and ZO-1 are also observed in human kidneys. Since these renal segments are mainly for controlling the paracellular cation transport, it is suggested that claudin-19 may participate in these processes. In human polycystic kidneys, decreased expression and dyslocalization of claudin-19 are noticed, suggesting a possible correlation between claudin-19 and renal disorders. Taken together, claudin-19 is a claudin isoform that is highly and specifically expressed in renal tubules with a putative role in TJ homeostasis in renal physiology.

Coordinated action of NSF and PKC regulates GABAB receptor signaling
efficacy.

<ABSTRACT>
The obligatory heterodimerization of the GABAB receptor (GBR) raises fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms controlling its signaling efficacy. Here, we show that NEM sensitive fusion (NSF) protein interacts directly with the GBR heterodimer both in rat brain synaptosomes and in CHO cells, forming a ternary complex that can be regulated by agonist stimulation. Inhibition of NSF binding with a peptide derived from GBR2 (TAT-Pep-27) did not affect basal signaling activity but almost completely abolished agonist-promoted GBR desensitization in both CHO cells and hippocampal slices. Taken with the role of PKC in the desensitization process, our observation that TAT-Pep-27 prevented both agonist-promoted recruitment of PKC and receptor phosphorylation suggests that NSF is a priming factor required for GBR desensitization. Given that GBR desensitization does not involve receptor internalization, the NSF/PKC coordinated action revealed herein suggests that NSF can regulate GPCR signalling efficacy independently of its role in membrane trafficking. The functional interaction between three bona fide regulators of neurotransmitter release, such as GBR, NSF and PKC, could shed new light on the modulation of presynaptic GBR action.

Previously we described presenilin-1 (PS1) as a GSK-3beta substrate [Kirschenbaum, F., Hsu, S.C., Cordell, B. and McCarthy, J.V. (2001) Substitution of a glycogen synthase kinase-3beta phosphorylation site in presenilin 1 separates presenilin function from beta-catenin signalling. J. Biol.

Chem. 276, 30701-30707], though it has not been determined whether PS1 is a primed or unprimed GSK-3beta substrate. A means of separating GSK-3beta activity toward primed and unprimed substrates was identified in the GSK-3beta-R96A phosphate binding pocket mutant [Frame, S., Cohen, P. and Biondi, R.M. (2001) A common phosphate binding site explains the unique substrate specificity of GSK3 and its inactivation by phosphorylation. Mol. Cell 7, 1321-1327], which is unable to phosphorylate primed but retains the ability to phosphorylate unprimed GSK-3beta substrates. By using wild type GSK-3beta, GSK-3beta-R96A, and a pharmacological modulator of GSK-3beta activity, we demonstrate that PS1 is an unprimed GSK-3beta substrate. These findings have important implications for regulation of PS1 function and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

<ABSTRACT>
Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). More than 50% of these mutations lead to receptor proteins that are completely or partly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The mechanisms involved in the intracellular processing and retention of mutant LDLR are poorly understood. In the present study we show that the G544V mutant LDLR associates with the chaperones Grp78, Grp94, ERp72, and calnexin in the ER of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Retention of the mutant LDLR was shown to cause ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response. We observed a marked increase in the activity of two ER stress sensors, IRE1 and PERK. These results show that retention of mutant LDLR in ER induces cellular responses, which might be important for the clinical outcome of familial hypercholesterolemia.

Biosynthesis of tumorigenic HER2 C-terminal fragments by alternative
initiation of translation.
</TITLE>

<ABSTRACT>
The overactivation of the HERs, a family of tyrosine kinase receptors, leads to the development of cancer. Although the canonical view contemplates HER receptors restricted to the secretory and endocytic pathways, full-length HER1, HER2 and HER3 have been detected in the nucleoplasm. Furthermore, limited proteolysis of HER4 generates nuclear C-terminal fragments (CTFs). Using cells expressing a panel of deletion and point mutants, here we show that HER2 CTFs are generated by alternative initiation of translation from methionines located near the transmembrane domain of the full-length molecule. In vitro and in vivo, HER2 CTFs are found in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Expression of HER2 CTFs to levels similar to those found in human tumors induces the growth of breast cancer xenografts in nude mice. Tumors dependent on CTFs are sensitive to inhibitors of the kinase activity but do not respond to therapeutic antibodies against HER2. Thus, the kinase domain seems necessary for the activity of HER2 CTFs and the presence of these HER2 fragments could account for the resistance to treatment with antibodies.

<ABSTRACT>
Better understanding of the underlying biology of malignant gliomas is critical for the development of early detection strategies and new therapeutics. This study aimed to define genes associated with survival. We investigated whether genes coupled with a class prediction model could be used to define subgroups of high-grade gliomas in a more objective manner than standard pathology. RNAs from 29 malignant gliomas were analysed using Agilent microarrays. We identified 21 genes whose expression was most strongly and consistently related to patient survival based on univariate proportional hazards models. In six out of 10 genes, changes in gene expression were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. After adjusting for clinical covariates based on a multivariate analysis, we finally obtained a statistical significance level for DDR1 (discoidin domain receptor family, member 1), DYRK3 (dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 3) and KSP37 (Ksp37 protein). In independent samples, it was confirmed that DDR1 protein expression was also correlated to the prognosis of glioma patients detected by immunohistochemical staining. Furthermore, we analysed the efficacy of the short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition of DDR1 mRNA synthesis in glioma cell lines. Cell proliferation and invasion were significantly suppressed by siRNA against DDR1. Thus, DDR1 can be a novel molecular target of therapy as well as an important predictive marker for survival in patients with glioma. Our method was effective at classifying high-grade gliomas objectively, and provided a more accurate predictor of prognosis than histological grading.Oncogene (2006) 25, 5994-6002. doi:10.1038/sj.onc.1209585; published online 1 May 2006.

X-chromosome targeting and dosage compensation are mediated by distinct
domains in MSL-3.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In Drosophila, dosage compensation of X-linked genes is achieved by transcriptional upregulation of the male X chromosome. Genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that male-specific lethal (MSL) proteins together with roX RNAs regulate this process. Here, we show that MSL-3 is essential for cell viability and that three domains in the protein have distinct roles in dosage compensation. The chromo-barrel domain (CBD) is not necessary for MSL targeting to the male X chromosome but is important for male viability and equalization of X-linked gene transcription. The polar region cooperates with the CBD in MSL-3 function, whereas the MRG domain is responsible for targeting the protein to the X chromosome. Our results demonstrate that MSL-3 localization to the male X chromosome and transcriptional upregulation of X-linked genes are two separable functions of the MSL-3 protein.

Inhibition of IFN-gamma transcription by site-specific methylation during
T helper cell development.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Polarization of naive CD4 T cells into T helper type 2 (TH2) cells is characterized by expression of IL-4 and silencing of IFN-gamma. Here we show that during TH2 polarization, the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a is recruited to the IFN-gamma promoter and correspondingly the promoter undergoes progressive de novo methylation. Notably, the CpG located at the -53 position becomes methylated rapidly and this methylation inhibits ATF2/c-Jun and CREB transcription factor binding in vitro. In vivo, the same factors bind to the unmethylated IFN-gamma promoter in T helper type 1 (TH1) cells but not the methylated IFN-gamma promoter in TH2 cells. Furthermore, methylation at the -53 CpG alone is sufficient to inhibit the IFN-gamma promoter-driven reporter gene expression in a TH1 cell line. These findings suggest that rapid methylation of the evolutionarily conserved -53 CpG by Dnmt3a may suppress IFN-gamma transcription in developing TH2 cells by directly inhibiting transcription factor binding.

<ABSTRACT>
Neurotransmitter receptor clustering is thought to represent a critical parameter for neuronal transmission. Little is known about the mechanisms that anchor and concentrate inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in neurons. GABAA receptor (GABAAR) alpha5 subunits mainly locate at extrasynaptic sites and are thought to mediate tonic inhibition. Notably, similar as synaptic GABAARs, these receptor subtypes also appear in cluster formations at neuronal surface membranes and are of particular interest in cognitive processing. GABAAR alpha5 mutation or depletion facilitates trace fear conditioning or improves spatial learning in mice, respectively. Here, we identified the actin-binding protein radixin, a member of the ERM family, as the first directly interacting molecule that anchors GABAARs at cytoskeletal elements. Intramolecular activation of radixin is a functional prerequisite for GABAAR alpha5 subunit binding and both depletion of radixin expression as well as replacement of the radixin F-actin binding motif interferes with GABAAR alpha5 cluster formation. Our data suggest radixin to represent a critical factor in receptor localization and/or downstream signaling.

<ABSTRACT>
Doxorubicin, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) and 5-fluorouracil used in chemotherapy induce apoptosis in Hep3B cells in the absence of p53, p73, and functional Fas. Since mediators remain unknown, the requirement of PKC delta (PKCdelta) and c-Abl was investigated. Suppression of c-Abl or PKCdelta expression using SiRNAs impaired PARP cleavage, Gleevec and/or rottlerin inhibited the induction of the subG1 phase and the increase of reactive oxygen species level. Co-precipitations and phosphorylations to mitochondria of c-Abl, PKCdelta and Bcl-X(L/s) were induced. A depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and activations of caspase-2 and -9 were observed. We propose that, in the absence of p53, p73 and Fas, genotoxic drugs could require both PKCdelta and c-Abl to induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway.

Structure of doubly prenylated Ypt1:GDI complex and the mechanism of

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In eukaryotic cells Rab/Ypt GTPases represent a family of key membrane traffic controllers that associate with their targeted membranes via C-terminally conjugated geranylgeranyl groups. GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) is a general and essential regulator of Rab recycling that extracts prenylated Rab proteins from membranes at the end of their cycle of activity and facilitates their delivery to the donor membranes. Here, we present the structure of a complex between GDI and a doubly prenylated Rab protein. We show that one geranylgeranyl residue is deeply buried in a hydrophobic pocket formed by domain II of GDI, whereas the other lipid is more exposed to solvent and is skewed across several atoms of the first moiety. Based on structural information and biophysical measurements, we propose mechanistic and thermodynamic models for GDI and Rab escort protein-mediated interaction of RabGTPase with intracellular membranes.

<ABSTRACT>
Experimental studies revealed that the elements of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 5'-untranslated leader region (5'-UTR) can fold in vitro into two alternative conformations, branched (BMH) and 'linearized' (LDI) and switch between them to achieve different functionality. In this study we computationally explored in detail, with our massively parallel genetic algorithm (MPGAfold), the propensity of 13 HIV-1 5'-UTRs to fold into the BMH and the LDI conformation types. Besides the BMH conformations these results predict the existence of two functionally equivalent types of LDI conformations. One is similar to what has been shown in vitro to exist in HIV-1 LAI, the other is a novel conformation exemplified by HIV-1 MAL long-distance interactions. These novel MPGAfold results are further corroborated by a consensus probability matrix algorithm applied to a set of 155 HIV-1 sequences. We also have determined in detail the impact of various strain mutations, domain sizes and folds of elongating sequences simulating folding during transcription on HIV-1 RNA secondary structure folding dynamics.

<ABSTRACT>
Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are sensor-transducer proteins capable of decoding calcium signals in diverse phosphorylation-dependent calcium signaling networks in plants and some protists. Using a novel yeast two-hybrid (YTH) approach with constitutively active and/or catalytically inactive forms of AtCPK11 as bait, we identified AtDi19 as an AtCPK11-interacting protein. AtDi19 is a member of a small family of stress-induced genes. The interaction was confirmed using pull-down assays with in vitro translated AtCPK11 and GST-AtDi19 and localization studies in Arabidopsis protoplasts cotransfected with AtCPK11:GFP and AtDi19:DsRed2 protein fusions. We further showed that the interaction of AtDi19 is specific to both AtCPK4 and AtCPK11, whereas other closely related CPKs from Arabidopsis interacted weakly (e.g., AtCPK12) or did not interact (e.g., AtCPK26, AtCPK5 and AtCPK1) with AtDi19. Deletion analyses showed that a region containing two predicted nuclear localization signals (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES) of AtDi19 is essential for interaction with AtCPK11. We further demonstrated that AtDi19 is phosphorylated by AtCPK11 in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner at Thr105 and Ser107 within the AtDi19 bipartite NLS using in vitro kinase assays. Our data suggest that disruption of the autoinhibitor domain leading to the formation of a constitutively active CDPK may stabilize kinase-substrate interactions without affecting specificity.

<ABSTRACT>
We have examined whether replication of the chicken beta-globin locus changes during differentiation of primary erythroid progenitors into erythrocytes. In undifferentiated progenitors, four principal initiation sites and a replication fork pausing region (RFP) were observed. Forty-eight hours after induction of differentiation, the principal sites were maintained, even in the activated beta(A)-globin gene, some minor sites were enhanced, three new sites appeared and the RFP disappeared. One of the activated origins showed increased histone H3 K9K14 diacetylation, but the others did not. These results demonstrate a broadening of DNA replication origin usage during differentiation of untransformed metazoan cells and indicate that histone H3 diacetylation, other histone modifications so far reported and transcription are not crucial determinants of origin selection in this system.

Spontaneous mutations in KNOX genes give rise to a novel floral structure
in Antirrhinum.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
BACKGROUND: Petal spurs-tubular outgrowths that collect nectar-are considered key innovations because of their ability to change pollinator specificity and so cause reproductive isolation and speciation. Spurs have arisen frequently and rapidly in many taxa. To test their potential origins, we isolated spontaneous dominant mutations at two loci, HIRZ and INA, that cause novel outgrowths from Antirrhinum petals, resembling the petal spurs of closely related genera. RESULTS: HIRZ and INA were isolated and shown to encode similar KNOX homeodomain proteins that are normally expressed only in apical meristems and are likely to act redundantly. Both dominant mutations were caused by transposon insertions in noncoding regions that caused ectopic expression of functional transcripts, either in petals or in all lateral organs with more pleiotropic effects. Formation of a spur-like outgrowth, which resembled an ectopic petal tube, was dependent both on KNOX gene expression and dorsiventral asymmetry of the flower. CONCLUSIONS: These mutations provide an example of how petal spurs might evolve rapidly due to changes in regulatory gene expression.

Human TRPV4 channel splice variants revealed a key role of ankyrin domains
in multimerization and trafficking.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The TRPV4 cation channel exhibits a topology consisting of six predicted transmembrane domains (TM) with a putative pore loop between TM5 and TM6 and intracellular N- and C-tails, the former containing at least three ankyrin domains. Functional transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are supposed to result following the assembly of four subunits. However, the rules governing subunit assembly and protein domains implied in this process are only starting to emerge. The ankyrin, TM, and the C-tail domains have been identified as important determinants of the oligomerization process. We now describe the maturation and oligomerization of five splice variants of the TRPV4 channel. The already known TRPV4-A and TRPV4-B (delta384-444) variants and the new TRPV4-C (delta237-284), TRPV4-D (delta27-61), and TRPV4-E (delta237-284 and delta384-444) variants. All alternative spliced variants involved deletions in the cytoplasmic N-terminal region, affecting (except for TRPV4-D) the ankyrin domains. Subcellular localization, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, co-immunoprecipitation, glycosylation profile, and functional analysis of these variants permitted us to group them into two classes: group I (TRPV4-A and TRPV4-D) and group II (TRPV4-B, TRPV4-C, and TRPV4-E). Group I, unlike group II variants, were correctly processed, homo- and heteromultimerized in the endoplasmic reticulum, and were targeted to the plasma membrane where they responded to typical TRPV4 stimuli. Our results suggest that: 1) TRPV4 biogenesis involves core glycosylation and oligomerization in the endoplasmic reticulum followed by transfer to the Golgi apparatus for subsequent maturation; 2) ankyrin domains are necessary for oligomerization of TRPV4; and 3) lack of TRPV4 oligomerization determines its accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Crystal structure of dimeric FabZ of Plasmodium falciparum reveals
conformational switching to active hexamers by peptide flips.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The crystal structure of beta-hydroxyacyl acyl carrier protein dehydratase of Plasmodium falciparum (PfFabZ) has been determined at a resolution of 2.4 A. PfFabZ has been found to exist as a homodimer (d-PfFabZ) in the crystals of the present study in contrast to the reported hexameric form (h-PfFabZ) which is a trimer of dimers crystallized in a different condition. The catalytic sites of this enzyme are located in deep narrow tunnel-shaped pockets formed at the dimer interface. A histidine residue from one subunit of the dimer and a glutamate residue from the other subunit lining the tunnel form the catalytic dyad in the reported crystal structures. While the position of glutamate remains unaltered in the crystal structure of d-PfFabZ compared to that in h-PfFabZ, the histidine residue takes up an entirely different conformation and moves away from the tunnel leading to a His-Phe cis-trans peptide flip at the histidine residue. In addition, a loop in the vicinity has been observed to undergo a similar flip at a Tyr-Pro peptide bond. These alterations not only prevent the formation of a hexamer but also distort the active site geometry resulting in a dimeric form of FabZ that is incapable of substrate binding. The dimeric state and an altered catalytic site architecture make d-PfFabZ distinctly different from the FabZ structures described so far. Dynamic light scattering and size exclusion chromatographic studies clearly indicate a pH-related switching of the dimers to active hexamers.

PDGF regulates the actin cytoskeleton through hnRNP-K-mediated activation
of the ubiquitin E3-ligase MIR.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
PDGF is a potent chemotactic mitogen and a strong inductor of fibroblast motility. In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, exposure to PDGF but not EGF or IGF-1 causes a rapid loss of actin stress fibers (SFs) and focal adhesions (FAs), which is followed by the development of retractile dendritic protrusions and induction of motility. The PDGF-specific actin reorganization was blocked by inhibition of Src-kinase and the 26S proteasome. PDGF induced Src-dependent association between the multifunctional transcription/translation regulator hnRNP-K and the mRNA-encoding myosin regulatory light-chain (MRLC)-interacting protein (MIR), a E(3)-ubiquitin ligase that is MRLC specific. This in turn rapidly increased MIR expression, and led to ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of MRLC. Downregulation of MIR by RNA muting prevented the reorganization of actin structures and severely reduced the migratory and wound-healing potential of PDGF-treated cells. The results show that activation of MIR and the resulting removal of diphosphorylated MRLC are essential for PDGF to instigate and maintain control over the actin-myosin-based contractile system in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. The PDGF induced protein destabilization through the regulation of hnRNP-K controlled ubiquitin -ligase translation identifies a novel pathway by which external stimuli can regulate phenotypic development through rapid, organelle-specific changes in the activity and stability of cytoskeletal regulators.

<ABSTRACT>
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) is a multifunctional enzyme with serine protease and DEXH/D-box helicase domains. A crystal structure of the NS3 helicase domain (NS3h) was generated in the presence of a single-stranded oligonucleotide long enough to accommodate binding of two molecules of enzyme. Several amino acid residues at the interface of the two NS3h molecules were identified that appear to mediate a protein-protein interaction between domains 2 and 3 of adjacent molecules. Mutations were introduced into domain 3 to disrupt the putative interface and subsequently examined using an HCV subgenomic replicon, resulting in significant reduction in replication capacity. The mutations in domain 3 were then examined using recombinant NS3h in biochemical assays. The mutant enzyme showed RNA binding and RNA-stimulated ATPase activity that mirrored wild type NS3h. In DNA unwinding assays under single turnover conditions, the mutant NS3h exhibited a similar unwinding rate and only approximately 2-fold lower processivity than wild type NS3h. Overall biochemical activities of the mutant NS3h were similar to the wild type enzyme, which was not reflective of the large reduction in HCV replicative capacity observed in the biological experiment. Hence, the biological results suggest that the known biochemical properties associated with the helicase activity of NS3h do not reveal all of the likely biological roles of NS3 during HCV replication. Domain 3 of NS3 is implicated in protein-protein interactions that are necessary for HCV replication.

Shugoshin collaborates with protein phosphatase 2A to protect cohesin.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Sister chromatid cohesion, mediated by a complex called cohesin, is crucial--particularly at centromeres--for proper chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis. In animal mitotic cells, phosphorylation of cohesin promotes its dissociation from chromosomes, but centromeric cohesin is protected by shugoshin until kinetochores are properly captured by the spindle microtubules. However, the mechanism of shugoshin-dependent protection of cohesin is unknown. Here we find a specific subtype of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) associating with human shugoshin. PP2A colocalizes with shugoshin at centromeres and is required for centromeric protection. Purified shugoshin complex has an ability to reverse the phosphorylation of cohesin in vitro, suggesting that dephosphorylation of cohesin is the mechanism of protection at centromeres. Meiotic shugoshin of fission yeast also associates with PP2A, with both proteins collaboratively protecting Rec8-containing cohesin at centromeres. Thus, we have revealed a conserved mechanism of centromeric protection of eukaryotic chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis.

<ABSTRACT>
We identified a truncated form (38-117) of GEC1 that interacts with the C-tail of the human kappa opioid receptor (hKOR) by yeast two-hybrid screening. GEC1-(38-117) did not interact with the C-tail of the mu or delta opioid receptors. GEC1, a 117-amino acid protein (Pellerin, I., Vuillermoz, C., Jouvenot, M., Ordener, C., Royez, M., and Adessi, G. L. (1993) Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 90, R17-R21), is highly homologous to GABARAP, GATE-16, and Apg8/aut7, all members of the microtubule associated protein (MAP) family. In pull-down assays, GST-GEC1 interacted directly with the hKOR C-tail, full-length hKOR, and tubulin. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, GEC1 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-hKOR. Expression of GEC1 greatly increased total and cell-surface KOR but not mu or delta opioid receptors. GEC1 expression slightly reduced U50,488H-promoted down-regulation, without affecting ligand binding affinity, receptor-G protein coupling, or U50,488H-induced desensitization and internalization. HA-GEC1 expressed in CHO cells was localized in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When cells were pulsed with [35S]Met/Cys, GEC1 expression enhanced the level of the mature form (55-kDa band) of FLAG-hKOR at 4, 8, and 22 h after pulse without affecting the precursors (39- and 45-kDa bands), indicating that GEC1 facilitates trafficking of FLAG-hKOR from the ER/Golgi to plasma membranes. GEC1 interacted with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) in pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitated with NSF in rat brain extracts. The interaction with NSF may contribute to GEC1 effects. This is the first report on biological functions of GEC1 and the first demonstration that a GPCR interacts with a protein of the MAP family. The interaction is important for trafficking of the receptor in the biosynthesis pathway.

Selective inhibition of the Fc epsilon RI-induced de novo synthesis of

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Aggregation of the type 1 Fc-epsilon receptors (Fc-epsilon-RI) on mast cells initiates a network of biochemical processes culminating in secretion of both granule-stored and de novo-synthesized inflammatory mediators. A strict control of this response is obviously a necessity; nevertheless, this regulation is hardly characterized. Here we report that a prototype inhibitory receptor, the mast cell function-associated antigen (MAFA), selectively regulates the Fc-epsilon-RI stimulus-response coupling network and the subsequent de novo production and secretion of inflammatory mediators. Specifically, MAFA suppresses the PLC-gamma2-[Ca2+]i, Raf-1-Erk1/2, and PKC-p38 coupling pathways, while the Fyn-Gab2-mediated activation of PKB and Jnk is essentially unaffected. Hence, the activities of several transcription/nuclear factors for inflammatory mediators (NF-kappaB, NFAT) are markedly reduced, while those of others (Jun, Fos, Fra, p90rsk) are unaltered. This results in a selective inhibition of gene transcription of cytokines including IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-8, and IL-10, while that of TNF-alpha, MCP-1, IL-3, IL-5, or IL-13 remains unaffected. Taken together, these results illustrate the capacity of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif-containing receptor to cause tight and specific control of the production and secretion of inflammatory mediators by mast cells.

<ABSTRACT>
The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor is a heterodimer of a family B G-protein-coupled receptor, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR), and the accessory protein receptor activity modifying protein 1. It couples to G(s), but it is not known which intracellular loops mediate this. We have identified the boundaries of this loop based on the relative position and length of the juxtamembrane transmembrane regions 3 and 4. The loop has been analyzed by systematic mutagenesis of all residues to alanine, measuring cAMP accumulation, CGRP affinity, and receptor expression. Unlike rhodopsin, ICL2 of the CGRP receptor plays a part in the conformational switch after agonist interaction. His-216 and Lys-227 were essential for a functional CGRP-induced cAMP response. The effect of (H216A)CLR is due to a disruption to the cell surface transport or surface stability of the mutant receptor. In contrast, (K227A)CLR had wild-type expression and agonist affinity, suggesting a direct disruption to the downstream signal transduction mechanism of the CGRP receptor. Modeling suggests that the loop undergoes a significant shift in position during receptor activation, exposing a potential G-protein binding pocket. Lys-227 changes position to point into the pocket, potentially allowing it to interact with bound G-proteins. His-216 occupies a position similar to that of Tyr-136 in bovine rhodopsin, part of the DRY motif of the latter receptor. This is the first comprehensive analysis of an entire intracellular loop within the calcitonin family of G-protein-coupled receptor. These data help to define the structural and functional characteristics of the CGRP-receptor and of family B G-protein-coupled receptors in general.

Expression and characterization of full-length human huntingtin, an

<ABSTRACT>
Huntington disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats, resulting in a polyglutamine stretch of >37 on the N terminus of the protein huntingtin (htt). htt is a large (347 kDa), ubiquitously expressed protein. The precise functions of htt are not clear, but its importance is underscored by the embryonic lethal phenotype in htt knock-out mice. Despite the fact that the htt gene was cloned 13 years ago, little is known about the properties of the full-length protein. Here we report the expression and preliminary characterization of recombinant full-length wild-type human htt. Our results support a model of htt composed entirely of HEAT repeats that stack to form an elongated superhelix.

Sema4D/plexin-B1 activates GSK-3beta through R-Ras GAP activity, inducing
growth cone collapse.

<ABSTRACT>
Plexins are receptors for the axonal guidance molecules known as semaphorins, and the semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) receptor plexin-B1 induces repulsive responses by functioning as an R-Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Here we characterized the downstream signalling of plexin-B1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity, inducing growth cone collapse. Sema4D suppressed R-Ras activity in hippocampal neurons, in parallel with dephosphorylation of Akt and activation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta. Ectopic expression of the constitutively active mutant of Akt or treatment with GSK-3 inhibitors suppressed the Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse. Constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K), an upstream kinase of Akt and GSK-3beta, also blocked the growth cone collapse. The R-Ras GAP activity was necessary for plexin-B1-induced dephosphorylation of Akt and activation of GSK-3beta and was also required for phosphorylation of a downstream kinase of GSK-3beta, collapsin response mediator protein-2. Plexin-A1 also induced dephosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta through its R-Ras GAP activity. We conclude that plexin-B1 inactivates PI(3)K and dephosphorylates Akt and GSK-3beta through R-Ras GAP activity, inducing growth cone collapse.

Heat shock proteins reduce alpha-synuclein aggregation induced by MPP+ in

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Alpha-synuclein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Heat shock proteins (HSPs) can reduce protein misfolding and accelerate the degradation of misfolded proteins. 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) is the compound responsible for the PD-like neurodegeneration caused by MPTP. In this study, we found that MPP+ could increase the expression of alpha-synuclein mRNA but could not elevate proteasome activity sufficiently, leading to alpha-synuclein protein accumulation followed by aggregation. Both HSPs and HDJ-1, a homologue of human Hsp40, can inhibit MPP+-induced alpha-synuclein mRNA expression, promote ubiquitination and elevate proteasome activity. These findings suggest that HSPs may inhibit the MPP+-induced alpha-synuclein expression, accelerate alpha-synuclein degradation, thereby reducing the amount of alpha-synuclein protein and accordingly preventing its aggregation.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Precursor protein targeting toward organellar surfaces is assisted by different cytosolic chaperones. We demonstrate that the chloroplast protein translocon subunit Toc64 is the docking site for Hsp90 affiliated preproteins. Thereby, Hsp90 is recognised by the clamp type TPR domain of Toc64. The subsequent transfer of the preprotein from Toc64 to the major receptor of the Toc complex, namely Toc34, is affinity driven and nucleotide dependent. We propose that Toc64 acts as an initial docking site for Hsp90 associated precursor proteins. We outline a mechanism in which chaperones are recruited for a specific targeting event by a membrane-inserted receptor.

Adaptor functions of Cdc42, Ste50, and Sho1 in the yeast osmoregulatory
HOG MAPK pathway.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The yeast high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling pathway can be activated by either of the two upstream pathways, termed the SHO1 and SLN1 branches. When stimulated by high osmolarity, the SHO1 branch activates an MAP kinase module composed of the Ste11 MAPKKK, the Pbs2 MAPKK, and the Hog1 MAPK. To investigate how osmostress activates this MAPK module, we isolated both gain-of-function and loss-of-function alleles in four key genes involved in the SHO1 branch, namely SHO1, CDC42, STE50, and STE11. These mutants were characterized using an HOG-dependent reporter gene, 8xCRE-lacZ. We found that Cdc42, in addition to binding and activating the PAK-like kinases Ste20 and Cla4, binds to the Ste11-Ste50 complex to bring activated Ste20/Cla4 to their substrate Ste11. Activated Ste11 and its HOG pathway-specific substrate, Pbs2, are brought together by Sho1; the Ste11-Ste50 complex binds to the cytoplasmic domain of Sho1, to which Pbs2 also binds. Thus, Cdc42, Ste50, and Sho1 act as adaptor proteins that control the flow of the osmostress signal from Ste20/Cla4 to Ste11, then to Pbs2.

On the power of chemical synthesis: immunological evaluation of models for
multiantigenic carbohydrate-based cancer vaccines.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Synthetic carbohydrate cancer vaccines have been shown to stimulate antibody-based immune responses in both preclinical and clinical settings. The antibodies have been observed to react in vitro with the corresponding natural carbohydrate antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells, and are able to mediate complement-dependent and/or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, these vaccines have proven to be safe when administered to cancer patients. Until recently, only monovalent antigen constructs had been prepared and evaluated. Advances in total synthesis have now enabled the preparation of multivalent vaccine constructs, which contain several different tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens. Such constructs could, in principle, serve as superior mimics of cell surface antigens and, hence, as potent cancer vaccines. Here we report preclinical ELISA-based evaluation of a TF-Le(y)-Tn bearing construct (compound 3) with native mucin glycopeptide architecture and a Globo-H-Le(y)-Tn glycopeptide (compound 4) with a nonnative structure. Mice were immunized with one or the other of these constructs as free glycopeptides or as keyhole lymphet hemocyanin conjugates. Either QS-21 or the related GPI-0100 were coadministered as adjuvants. Both keyhole lymphet hemocyanin conjugates induced IgM and IgG antibodies against each carbohydrate antigen, however, the mucin-based TF-Le(y)-Tn construct was shown to be less antigenic than the unnatural Globo-H-Le(y)-Tn construct. The adjuvants, although related, proved significantly different, in that GPI-0100 consistently induced higher titers of antibodies than QS-21. The presence of multiple glycans in these constructs did not appear to suppress the response against any of the constituent antigens. Compound 4, the more antigenic of the two constructs, was also examined by fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis. Significantly, from these studies it was shown that antibodies stimulated in response to compound 4 reacted with tumor cells known to selectively express the individual antigens. The results demonstrate that single vaccine constructs bearing several different carbohydrate antigens have the potential to stimulate a multifaceted immune response.

<ABSTRACT>
In order to understand the functional significance of the transmembrane domain of TrwB, an integral membrane protein involved in bacterial conjugation, the protein was purified in the native, and also as a truncated soluble form (TrwBDeltaN70). The intact protein (TrwB) binds preferentially purine over pyrimidine nucleotides, NTPs over NDPs, and ribo- over deoxyribonucleotides. In contrast, TrwBDeltaN70 binds uniformly all tested nucleotides. The transmembrane domain has the general effect of making the nucleotide binding site(s) less accessible, but more selective. This is in contrast to other membrane proteins in which most of the protein mass, including the catalytic domain, is outside the membrane, but whose activity is not modified by the presence or absence of the transmembrane segment.

Induction of apoptosis limits cytomegalovirus cross-species infection.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cross-species infections are responsible for the majority of emerging and re-emerging viral diseases. However, little is known about the mechanisms that restrict viruses to a certain host species, and the factors viruses need to cross the species barrier and replicate in a different host. Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) are representatives of the beta-herpesviruses that are highly species specific. They replicate only in cells of their own or a closely related species. In this study, the molecular mechanism underlying the cytomegalovirus species specificity was investigated. We show that infection of human cells with the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) triggers the intrinsic apoptosis pathway involving caspase-9 activation. MCMV can break the species barrier and replicate in human cells if apoptosis is blocked by Bcl-2 or a functionally analogous protein. A single gene of the human cytomegalovirus encoding a mitochondrial inhibitor of apoptosis is sufficient to allow MCMV replication in human cells. Moreover, the same principle facilitates replication of the rat cytomegalovirus in human cells. Thus, induction of apoptosis serves as an innate immune defense to inhibit cross-species infections of rodent CMVs.

Large nucleotide-dependent movement of the N-terminal domain of the ClpX
chaperone.

<ABSTRACT>
The ClpXP ATPase-protease complex is a major component of the protein quality control machinery in the cell. A ClpX subunit consists of an N-terminal zinc binding domain (ZBD) and a C-terminal AAA+ domain. ClpX oligomerizes into a hexamer with the AAA+ domains forming the base of the hexamer and the ZBDs extending out of the base. Here, we report that ClpX switches between a capture and a feeding conformation. ZBDs in ClpX undergo large nucleotide-dependent block movement towards ClpP and into the AAA+ ring. This motion is modulated by the ClpX cofactor, SspB. Evidence for this movement was initially obtained by the surprising observation that an N-terminal extension on ClpX is clipped by bound ClpP in functional ClpXP complexes. Protease-protection, crosslinking, and light scattering experiments further support these findings.

<ABSTRACT>
The protein Sup35 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses prion properties. In vivo, a high molecular weight form of Sup35p is associated to the [PSI+] factor. The continued propagation of [PSI+] is highly dependent on the expression levels of molecular chaperones from the Hsp100, 70 and 40 families; however, so far, their role in this process is unclear. We have developed a reproducible in vitro system to study the effects of molecular chaperones on the assembly of full-length Sup35p. We show that Hsp104p greatly stimulates the assembly of Sup35p into fibrils, whereas Ydj1p has inhibitory effect. Hsp82p, Ssa1p and Sis1p, individually, do not affect assembly. In contrast, Ssa1p together with either of its Hsp40 cochaperones blocks Sup35p polymerization. Furthermore, Ssa1p and Ydj1p or Sis1p can counteract the stimulatory activity of Hsp104p, by forming complexes with Sup35p oligomers, in an ATP-dependent manner. Our observations reveal the functional differences between Hsp104p and the Hsp70-40 systems in the assembly of Sup35p into fibrils and bring new insight into the mechanism by which molecular chaperones influence the propagation of [PSI+].

NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Replication licensing is carefully regulated to restrict replication to once in a cell cycle. In higher eukaryotes, regulation of the licensing factor Cdt1 by proteolysis and Geminin is essential to prevent re-replication. We show here that the N-terminal 100 amino acids of human Cdt1 are recognized for proteolysis by two distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases during S-G2 phases. Six highly conserved amino acids within the 10 first amino acids of Cdt1 are essential for DDB1-Cul4-mediated proteolysis. This region is also involved in proteolysis following DNA damage. The second E3 is SCF-Skp2, which recognizes the Cy-motif-mediated Cyclin E/A-cyclin-dependent kinase-phosphorylated region. Consistently, in HeLa cells cosilenced of Skp2 and Cul4, Cdt1 remained stable in S-G2 phases. The Cul4-containing E3 is active during ongoing replication, while SCF-Skp2 operates both in S and G2 phases. PCNA binds to Cdt1 through the six conserved N-terminal amino acids. PCNA is essential for Cul4- but not Skp2-directed degradation during DNA replication and following ultraviolet-irradiation. Our data unravel multiple distinct pathways regulating Cdt1 to block re-replication.

Structure and E3-ligase activity of the Ring-Ring complex of polycomb

<ABSTRACT>
Polycomb group proteins Ring1b and Bmi1 (B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukaemia virus integration site 1) are critical components of the chromatin modulating PRC1 complex. Histone H2A ubiquitination by the PRC1 complex strongly depends on the Ring1b protein. Here we show that the E3-ligase activity of Ring1b on histone H2A is enhanced by Bmi1 in vitro. The N-terminal Ring-domains are sufficient for this activity and Ring1a can replace Ring1b. E2 enzymes UbcH5a, b, c or UbcH6 support this activity with varying processivity and selectivity. All four E2s promote autoubiquitination of Ring1b without affecting E3-ligase activity. We solved the crystal structure of the Ring-Ring heterodimeric complex of Ring1b and Bmi1. In the structure the arrangement of the Ring-domains is similar to another H2A E3 ligase, the BRCA1/BARD1 complex, but complex formation depends on an N-terminal arm of Ring1b that embraces the Bmi1 Ring-domain. Mutation of a critical residue in the E2/E3 interface shows that catalytic activity resides in Ring1b and not in Bmi1. These data provide a foundation for understanding the critical enzymatic activity at the core of the PRC1 polycomb complex, which is implicated in stem cell maintenance and cancer.

<ABSTRACT>
Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni have been shown to modify their flagellins with pseudaminic acid (Pse), via O-linkage, while C. jejuni also possesses a general protein glycosylation pathway (Pgl) responsible for the N-linked modification of at least 30 proteins with a heptasaccharide containing 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose, a derivative of bacillosamine. To further define the Pse and bacillosamine biosynthetic pathways, we have undertaken functional characterization of UDP-alpha-D-GlcNAc modifying dehydratase/aminotransferase pairs, in particular the H. pylori and C. jejuni flagellar pairs HP0840/HP0366 and Cj1293/Cj1294, as well as the C. jejuni Pgl pair Cj1120c/Cj1121c using His(6)-tagged purified derivatives. The metabolites produced by these enzymes were identified using NMR spectroscopy at 500 and/or 600 MHz with a cryogenically cooled probe for optimal sensitivity. The metabolites of Cj1293 (PseB) and HP0840 (FlaA1) were found to be labile and could only be characterized by NMR analysis directly in aqueous reaction buffer. The Cj1293 and HP0840 enzymes exhibited C6 dehydratase as well as a newly identified C5 epimerase activity that resulted in the production of both UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-beta-L-arabino-4-hexulose and UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-xylo-4-hexulose. In contrast, the Pgl dehydratase Cj1120c (PglF) was found to possess only C6 dehydratase activity generating UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-xylo-4-hexulose. Substrate-specificity studies demonstrated that the flagellar aminotransferases HP0366 and Cj1294 utilize only UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-beta-L-arabino-4-hexulose as substrate producing UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-beta-L-AltNAc, a precursor in the Pse biosynthetic pathway. In contrast, the Pgl aminotransferase Cj1121c (PglE) utilizes only UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-xylo-4-hexulose producing UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-GlcNAc (UDP-2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose), a precursor used in the production of the Pgl glycan component 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose.

<ABSTRACT>
In Drosophila melanogaster, the axons of retinal photoreceptor cells extend to the first optic ganglion, the lamina, forming a topographic representation. Here we show that DWnt4, a secreted protein of the Wnt family, is the ventral cue for the lamina. In DWnt4 mutants, ventral retinal axons misprojected to the dorsal lamina. DWnt4 was normally expressed in the ventral half of the developing lamina and DWnt4 protein was detected along ventral retinal axons. Dfrizzled2 and dishevelled, respectively, encode a receptor and a signaling molecule required for Wnt signaling. Mutations in both genes caused DWnt4-like defects, and both genes were autonomously required in the retina, suggesting a direct role of DWnt4 in retinal axon guidance. In contrast, iroquois homeobox genes are the dorsal cues for the retina. Dorsal axons accumulated DWnt4 and misprojected to the ventral lamina in iroquois mutants; the phenotype was suppressed in iroquois Dfrizzled2 mutants, suggesting that iroquois may attenuate the competence of Dfrizzled2 to respond to DWnt4.

<ABSTRACT>
Conserved domains within the RNA component of telomerase provide the template for reverse transcription, recruit protein components to the holoenzyme and are required for enzymatic activity. Among the functionally essential domains in ciliate telomerase RNA is stem-loop IV, which strongly stimulates telomerase activity and processivity even when provided in trans. The NMR structure of Tetrahymena thermophila stem-loop IV shows a highly structured distal stem-loop linked to a conformationally flexible template-proximal region by a bulge that severely kinks the entire RNA. Through extensive structure-function studies, we identify residues that contribute to both these structural features and to enzymatic activity, with no apparent effect on the binding of TERT protein. We propose that the bending induced by the GA bulge and the flexibility of the template-proximal region allow positioning of the prestructured apical loop during the catalytic cycle.

<ABSTRACT>
Plenty of SH3s (POSH) functions as a scaffold protein for the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal transduction pathway, which leads to cell death in mammalian cultured cells and Drosophila. Here, we show that POSH forms a complex with Apoptosis-linked gene-2 (ALG-2) and ALG-2-interacting protein (ALIX/AIP1) in a calcium-dependent manner. Overexpression of ALG-2 or ALIX in developing imaginal eye discs resulted in roughened or melanized eyes, respectively. These phenotypes were enhanced by co-overexpression of POSH. We found that overexpression of either gene could induce ectopic JNK activation, suggesting that POSH/ALG-2/ALIX may function together in the regulation of the JNK pathway.

<ABSTRACT>
We report an efficient, controllable, site-specific replication roadblock that blocks cell proliferation, but which can be rapidly and efficiently reversed, leading to recovery of viability. Escherichia coli replication forks of both polarities stalled in vivo within the first 500 bp of a 10 kb repressor-bound array of operator DNA-binding sites. Controlled release of repressor binding led to rapid restart of the blocked replication fork without the participation of homologous recombination. Cytological tracking of fork stalling and restart showed that the replisome-associated SSB protein remains associated with the blocked fork for extended periods and that duplication of the fluorescent foci associated with the blocked operator array occurs immediately after restart, thereby demonstrating a lack of sister cohesion in the region of the array. Roadblocks positioned near oriC or the dif site did not prevent replication and segregation of the rest of the chromosome.

Nuclear Akt associates with PKC-phosphorylated Ebp1, preventing DNA
fragmentation by inhibition of caspase-activated DNase.

<ABSTRACT>
Akt promotes cell survival through phosphorylation. The physiological functions of cytoplasmic Akt have been well defined, but little is known about the nuclear counterpart. Employing a cell-free apoptotic assay and NGF-treated PC12 nuclear extracts, we purified Ebp1 as a factor, which contributes to inhibition of DNA fragmentation by CAD. Depletion of Ebp1 from nuclear extracts or knockdown of Ebp1 in PC12 cells abolishes the protective effects of nerve growth factor, whereas overexpression of Ebp1 prevents apoptosis. Ebp1 (S360A), which cannot be phosphorylated by PKC, barely binds Akt or inhibits DNA fragmentation, whereas Ebp1 S360D, which mimics phosphorylation, strongly binds Akt and suppresses apoptosis. Further, phosphorylated nuclear but not cytoplasmic Akt interacts with Ebp1 and enhances its antiapoptotic action independent of Akt kinase activity. Moreover, knocking down of Akt diminishes the antiapoptotic effect of Ebp1 in the nucleus. Thus, nuclear Akt might contribute to suppressing apoptosis through interaction with Ebp1.

<ABSTRACT>
The active site of [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases is composed of a di-iron complex, where the two metal atoms are bridged together by a putative di(thiomethyl)amine molecule and are also ligated by di-nuclear ligands, namely carbon monoxide and cyanide. Biosynthesis of this metal site is thought to require specific protein machinery coded by the hydE, hydF, and hydG genes. The HydF protein has been cloned from the thermophilic organism Thermotoga maritima, purified, and characterized. The enzyme possesses specific amino acid signatures for GTP binding and is able to hydrolyze GTP. The anaerobically reconstituted TmHydF protein binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster with peculiar EPR characteristics: an S = 1/2 signal presenting a high field shifted g-value together with a S = 3/2 signal, similar to those observed for [4Fe-4S] clusters ligated by only three cysteines. HYSCORE spectroscopy experiments were carried out to determine the nature of the fourth ligand of the cluster, and its exchangeability was demonstrated with the formation of a [4Fe-4S]-imidazole complex.

Endocrine functions of bile acids.

<ABSTRACT>
Bile acids (BAs), a group of structurally diverse molecules that are primarily synthesized in the liver from cholesterol, are the chief components of bile. Besides their well-established roles in dietary lipid absorption and cholesterol homeostasis, it has recently emerged that BAs are also signaling molecules, with systemic endocrine functions. BAs activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, are ligands for the G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5, and activate nuclear hormone receptors such as farnesoid X receptor alpha. Through activation of these diverse signaling pathways, BAs can regulate their own enterohepatic circulation, but also triglyceride, cholesterol, energy, and glucose homeostasis. Thus, BA-controlled signaling pathways are promising novel drug targets to treat common metabolic diseases, such as obesity, type II diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerosis.

Identification of a lipid peroxidation product as a potential trigger of
the p53 pathway.
</TITLE>

<ABSTRACT>
The tumor suppressor and transcription factor p53 is a key modulator of cellular stress responses, and activation of p53 can trigger apoptosis in many cell types, including neurons. We found that this nuclear protein was significantly phosphorylated when human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to in vitro oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids. To identify an oxidized lipid that induces p53 phosphorylation, we conducted a screening of lipid peroxidation products in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and identified 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE), a recently identified aldehyde originating from the peroxidation of omega6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, as a potential inducer of the p53 phosphorylation. We also found that ONE induced the phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated, which plays an essential role in transmitting DNA damage signals by the phosphorylation of p53. In addition, exposure of the cells to ONE resulted in an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and in a significant inhibition of proteasome activities, suggesting that ONE acted on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a regulatory mechanism of p53 turnover. In addition, the observation that the ONE-induced p53 response was associated with the induction of apoptosis suggested that ONE activated the p53-dependent apoptosis mechanism via activation of the p53 signaling pathway and down-regulation of the p53 turnover. Finally, we observed that the ONE-2'-deoxyguanosine adduct, 7-(2-oxo-heptyl)-substituted 1,N(2)-etheno-2'-deoxyguanosine, was accumulated in the spinal cord motor neurons of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These data may suggest the potential critical role for ONE in the induction of a neuronal apoptosis program during oxidative processes.

Ataxin-7 can export from the nucleus via a conserved exportin-dependent
signal.

<ABSTRACT>
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG DNA triplet repeat expansion leading to an expanded polyglutamine tract in the ataxin-7 protein. Ataxin-7 appears to be a transcription factor and a component of the STAGA transcription coactivator complex. Here, using live cell imaging and inverted fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we demonstrate that ataxin-7 has the ability to export from the nucleus via the CRM-1/exportin pathway and that ataxin-7 contains a classic leucine-type nuclear export signal (NES). We have precisely defined the location of this NES in ataxin-7 and found it to be fully conserved in all vertebrate species. Polyglutamine expansion was seen to reduce the nuclear export rate of mutant ataxin-7 relative to wild-type ataxin-7. Subtle point mutation of the NES in polyglutamine expanded ataxin-7 increased toxicity in primary cerebellar neurons in a polyglutamine length-dependent manner in the context of full-length ataxin-7. Our results add ataxin-7 to a growing list of polyglutamine disease proteins that are capable of nuclear shuttling, and we define an activity of ataxin-7 in the STAGA complex of trafficking between the nucleus and cytoplasm.

Regulation of transactivation function of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor by
the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded EBNA-3 protein.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
EBNA-3 is one of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded nuclear antigens that is indispensable for immunoblastic transformation and sustained proliferation of B-lymphocytes. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the function of EBNA-3 are poorly understood. We previously found that EBNA-3 interacts with an immunophilin-like protein XAP2/ARA9/AIP, which in mammalian cells is known to interact with the latent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR is a ligand-inducible transcription factor that mediates cellular responses to environmental pollutants, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). In this study, we show that EBNA-3 interacts specifically with AhR. The stability of this interaction is determined by the activation state of AhR and its association with XAP2. We and others have demonstrated that XAP2 retains the nonactivated AhR in the cell cytoplasm. However, in the presence of TCDD, the effect of XAP2 on the intracellular localization of AhR was counter-acted by EBNA-3, resulting in nuclear translocation of the AhR. In addition, EBNA-3 enhanced transactivation function by the ligand-activated AhR in cells, as assessed by reporter gene assays. Our data suggested that EBNA-3 plays a role in facilitating the ligand-dependent AhR activation process. Following activation of the AhR, we also observed that EBNA-3 counteracted the inhibitory effect of TCDD on the growth of EBV-carrying lymphoblasts. Taken together, our studies revealed a novel interaction between EBV- and AhR-dependent cellular pathways that control cell proliferation and survival.

P38MAPK-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of SRC-3/AIB1 and
RARalpha-mediated transcription.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Nuclear retinoic acid (RA) receptors (RARs) activate gene expression through dynamic interactions with coregulators in coordination with the ligand and phosphorylation processes. Here we show that during RA-dependent activation of the RARalpha isotype, the p160 coactivator pCIP/ACTR/AIB-1/RAC-3/TRAM-1/SRC-3 is phosphorylated by p38MAPK. SRC-3 phosphorylation has been correlated to an initial facilitation of RARalpha-target genes activation, via the control of the dynamics of the interactions of the coactivator with RARalpha. Then, phosphorylation inhibits transcription via promoting the degradation of SRC-3. In line with this, inhibition of p38MAPK markedly enhances RARalpha-mediated transcription and RA-dependent induction of cell differentiation. SRC-3 phosphorylation and degradation occur only within the context of RARalpha complexes, suggesting that the RAR isotype defines a phosphorylation code through dictating the accessibility of the coactivator to p38MAPK. We propose a model in which RARalpha transcriptional activity is regulated by SRC-3 through coordinated events that are fine-tuned by RA and p38MAPK.

Regulation of mitochondrial morphology through proteolytic cleavage of
OPA1.

<ABSTRACT>
The dynamin-like GTPase OPA1, a causal gene product of human dominant optic atrophy, functions in mitochondrial fusion and inner membrane remodeling. It has several splice variants and even a single variant is found as several processed forms, although their functional significance is unknown. In yeast, mitochondrial rhomboid protease regulates mitochondrial function and morphology through proteolytic cleavage of Mgm1, the yeast homolog of OPA1. We demonstrate that OPA1 variants are synthesized with a bipartite-type mitochondrial targeting sequence. During import, the matrix-targeting signal is removed and processed forms (L-isoforms) are anchored to the inner membrane in type I topology. L-isoforms undergo further processing in the matrix to produce S-isoforms. Knockdown of OPA1 induced mitochondrial fragmentation, whose network morphology was recovered by expression of L-isoform but not S-isoform, indicating that only L-isoform is fusion-competent. Dissipation of membrane potential, expression of m-AAA protease paraplegin, or induction of apoptosis stimulated this processing along with the mitochondrial fragmentation. Thus, mammalian mitochondrial function and morphology is regulated through processing of OPA1 in a DeltaPsi-dependent manner.

Isoprenoid biosynthesis in plant chloroplasts via the MEP pathway: direct

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In the methylerythritol phosphate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis, the GcpE/IspG enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate into (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate. This reaction requires a double one-electron transfer involving a [4Fe-4S] cluster. A thylakoid preparation from spinach chloroplasts was capable in the presence of light to act as sole electron donor for the plant GcpE Arabidopsis thaliana in the absence of any pyridine nucleotide. This is in sharp contrast with the bacterial Escherichia coli GcpE, which requires flavodoxin/flavodoxin reductase and NADPH as reducing system and represents the first proof that the electron flow from photosynthesis can directly act in phototrophic organisms as reducer in the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway, most probably via ferredoxin, in the absence of any reducing cofactor. In the dark, the plant GcpE catalysis requires in addition of ferredoxin NADP(+)/ferredoxin oxido-reductase and NADPH as electron shuttle.

<ABSTRACT>
The ability of psychrophiles to survive and proliferate at low temperatures implies that they have overcome key barriers inherent to permanently cold environments. These challenges include: reduced enzyme activity; decreased membrane fluidity; altered transport of nutrients and waste products; decreased rates of transcription, translation and cell division; protein cold-denaturation; inappropriate protein folding; and intracellular ice formation. Cold-adapted organisms have successfully evolved features, genotypic and/or phenotypic, to surmount the negative effects of low temperatures and to enable growth in these extreme environments. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of these adaptations as gained from extensive biochemical and biophysical studies and also from genomics and proteomics.

IgE-dependent activation of sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 and secretion of

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Engagement of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI) on mast cells results in the production and secretion of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid metabolite present in the lungs of allergen-challenged asthmatics. Herein we report that two isoforms of sphingosine kinase (SphK1 and SphK2) are expressed and activated upon FcepsilonRI engagement of bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC). Fyn kinase is required for FcepsilonRI coupling to SphK1 and -2 and for subsequent S1P production. Normal activation of SphK1 and -2 was restored by expression of wild type Fyn but only partly with a kinase-defective Fyn, indicating that induction of SphK1 and SphK2 depended on both catalytic and noncatalytic properties of Fyn. Downstream of Fyn, the requirements for SphK1 activation differed from that of SphK2. Whereas SphK1 was considerably dependent on the adapter Grb2-associated binder 2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase, SphK2 showed minimal dependence on these molecules. Fyn-deficient BMMC were defective in chemotaxis and, as previously reported, in degranulation. These functional responses were partly reconstituted by the addition of exogenous S1P to FcepsilonRI-stimulated cells. Taken together with our previous study, which demonstrated delayed SphK activation in Lyn-deficient BMMC, we propose a cooperative role between Fyn and Lyn kinases in the activation of SphKs, which contributes to mast cell responses.

Regulation of sensory neuron-specific acid-sensing ion channel 3 by the
adaptor protein Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are cationic channels activated by extracellular protons. The ASIC3 subunit is largely expressed in the peripheral nervous system, where it contributes to pain perception and to some aspects of mechanosensation. We report here a PDZ-dependent and protein kinase C-modulated association between ASIC3 and the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1) adaptor protein. We show that NHERF-1 and ASIC3 are co-expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons. NHERF-1 enhances the ASIC3 peak current in heterologous cells, including F-11 dorsal root ganglion cells, by increasing the amount of channel at the plasma membrane. Perhaps more importantly, we show that the plateau current of ASIC3 can be dramatically increased (10-30-fold) by association with NHERF-1, leading to a significant sustained current at pH 6.6. In the presence of NHERF-1, the ASIC3 subcellular localization is modified, and the channel co-localizes with ezrin, a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin family of actin-binding proteins, providing the first direct link between ASIC3 and the cortical cytoskeleton. Given the importance of the ASIC3 sustained current in nociceptor excitability, it is likely that NHERF-1 participates in channel functions associated with nociception and mechanosensation.

Role of glutaredoxin-3 and glutaredoxin-4 in the iron regulation of the
Aft1 transcriptional activator in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The transcription factors Aft1 and Aft2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulate the expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis. These factors induce the expression of iron regulon genes in iron-deficient yeast but are inactivated in iron-replete cells. Iron inhibition of Aft1/Aft2 was previously shown to be dependent on mitochondrial components required for cytosolic iron sulfur protein biogenesis. We presently show that the nuclear monothiol glutaredoxins Grx3 and Grx4 are critical for iron inhibition of Aft1 in yeast cells. Cells lacking both glutaredoxins show constitutive expression of iron regulon genes. Overexpression of Grx4 attenuates wild type Aft1 activity. The thioredoxin-like domain in Grx3 and Grx4 is dispensable in mediating iron inhibition of Aft1 activity, whereas the conserved cysteine that is part of the conserved CGFS motif in monothiol glutaredoxins is essential for this function. Grx3 and Grx4 interact with Aft1 as shown by two-hybrid interactions and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The interaction between glutaredoxins and Aft1 is not modulated by the iron status of cells but is dependent on the conserved glutaredoxin domain Cys residue. Thus, Grx3 and Grx4 are novel components required for Aft1 iron regulation that most likely occurs in the nucleus.

<ABSTRACT>
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) play key roles in the intracellular signaling pathways of the interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines, which exhibit a diverse set of cellular responses, including cell proliferation and differentiation. Dysregulated IL-6/STAT3 signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, for example autoimmune diseases and tumors. Type I interferon (IFN) induces the expression of proapoptotic genes and has been used in the clinical treatment of several tumors. In the present study, we found that type I IFN suppressed IL-6/STAT3-mediated transcription and gene expression. Furthermore, a type I IFN-induced protein, Daxx, also suppressed STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation, while overexpression of Daxx inhibited IL-6/STAT3-mediated gene expression. Importantly, small-interfering RNA-mediated reduction of Daxx expression enhanced IL-6/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced STAT3-dependent transcription. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed a physical interaction between Daxx and STAT3 in transiently transfected 293T cells. We further found that Daxx and STAT3 were co-localized in the nucleus. These results indicate that Daxx may serve as a transcriptional regulator of type I IFN-mediated suppression of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway.

Progressively impaired proteasomal capacity during terminal plasma cell

<ABSTRACT>
After few days of intense immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion, most plasma cells undergo apoptosis, thus ending the humoral immune response. We asked whether intrinsic factors link plasma cell lifespan to Ig secretion. Here we show that in the late phases of plasmacytic differentiation, when antibody production becomes maximal, proteasomal activity decreases. The excessive load for the reduced proteolytic capacity correlates with accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, stabilization of endogenous proteasomal substrates (including Xbp1s, IkappaBalpha, and Bax), onset of apoptosis, and sensitization to proteasome inhibitors (PI). These events can be reproduced by expressing Ig-mu chain in nonlymphoid cells. Our results suggest that a developmental program links plasma cell death to protein production, and help explaining the peculiar sensitivity of normal and malignant plasma cells to PI.

<ABSTRACT>
Many G protein-coupled receptors possess carboxyl-terminal motifs ideal for interaction with PDZ scaffold proteins, which can control receptor trafficking and signaling in a cell-specific manner. To gain a panoramic view of beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) interactions with PDZ scaffolds, the beta1AR carboxyl terminus was screened against a newly developed proteomic array of PDZ domains. These screens confirmed beta1AR associations with several previously identified PDZ partners, such as PSD-95, MAGI-2, GIPC, and CAL. Moreover, two novel beta1AR-interacting proteins, SAP97 and MAGI-3, were also identified. The beta1AR carboxyl terminus was found to bind specifically to the first PDZ domain of MAGI-3, with the last four amino acids (E-S-K-V) of beta1AR being the key determinants of the interaction. Full-length beta1AR robustly associated with full-length MAGI-3 in cells, and this association was abolished by mutation of the beta1AR terminal valine residue to alanine (V477A), as determined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and immunofluorescence co-localization studies. MAGI-3 co-expression with beta1AR profoundly impaired beta1AR-mediated ERK1/2 activation but had no apparent effect on beta1AR-mediated cyclic AMP generation or agonist-promoted beta1AR internalization. These findings revealed that the interaction of MAGI-3 with beta1AR can selectively regulate specific aspects of receptor signaling. Moreover, the screens of the PDZ domain proteomic array provide a comprehensive view of beta1AR interactions with PDZ scaffolds, thereby shedding light on the molecular mechanisms by which beta1 AR signaling and trafficking can be regulated in a cell-specific manner.

<ABSTRACT>
ADAMTS13 controls the multimeric size of circulating von Willebrand factor (VWF) by cleaving the Tyr1605-Met1606 bond in theA2 domain. To examine substrate recognition, we expressed in bacteria and purified three A2 (VWF76-(1593-1668), VWF115-(1554-1668), VWFA2-(1473-1668)) and one A2-A3 (VWF115-A3-(1554-1874)) domain fragments. Using high pressure liquid chromatography analysis, the initial rates of VWF115 cleavage by ADAMTS13 at different substrate concentrations were determined, and from this the kinetic constants were derived (Km 1.61 microM; kcat 0.14 s(-1)), from which the specificity constant kcat/Km was calculated, 8.70 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1). Similar values of the specificity constant were obtained for VWF76 and VWF115-A3. To identify residues important for recognition and proteolysis of VWF115, we introduced certain type 2A von Willebrand disease mutations by site-directed mutagenesis. Although most were cleaved normally, one (D1614G) was cleaved approximately 8-fold slower. Mutagenesis of additional charged residues predicted to be in close proximity to Asp1614 on the surface of the A2 domain (R1583A, D1587A, D1614A, E1615A, K1617A, E1638A, E1640A) revealed up to 13-fold reduction in kcat/Km for D1587A, D1614A, E1615A, and K1617A mutants. When introduced into the intact VWFA2 domain, proteolysis of the D1587A, D1614A, and E1615A mutants was also slowed, particularly in the presence of urea. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated appreciable reduction in binding affinity between ADAMTS13 and VWF115 mutants (KD up to approximately 1.3 microM), compared with VWF115 (KD 20 nM). These results demonstrate an important role for Asp1614 and surrounding charged residues in the binding and cleavage of the VWFA2 domain by ADAMTS13.

<ABSTRACT>
The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 is a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in oxygen homeostasis. We previously described testis-specific isoforms of HIF-1alpha (mHIF-1alphaI.1 and hHIF-1alphaTe). Using mHIF-1alpha exon I.1 knock-out mice we confirmed the specific expression of mHIF-1alphaI.1 in the sperm tail. A protein-protein interaction between HIF-1alpha and the testis specific gene antigen 10 (TSGA10) was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening. TSGA10 is expressed in testis but also in other organs and malignant tissues. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that the C-terminal part of TSGA10 accumulates in the midpiece of spermatozoa, where it co-localizes with HIF-1alpha. HIF-1alpha nuclear localization and HIF-1 transcriptional activity were significantly affected by overexpressed TSGA10.

<ABSTRACT>
To investigate a role for histidine residues in the expression of normal acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity, the histidine residues located at five different positions in two isoenzymes were substituted by alanine, based on the sequence homology between ACAT1 and ACAT2. Among the 10 mutants generated by baculovirus expression technology, H386A-ACAT1, H460A-ACAT1, H360A-ACAT2, and H399A-ACAT2 lost their enzymatic activity completely. A reduction in catalytic activity is unlikely to result from structural changes in the substrate-binding pocket, because their substrate-binding affinities were normal. However, the enzymatic activity of H386A-ACAT1 was restored to <37% of the level of the wild-type activity when cholesterol was replaced by 25-hydroxycholesterol as substrate. H527A-ACAT1 and H501A-ACAT2, termed carboxyl end mutants, exhibit activities of approximately 96% and approximately 75% of that of the wild-type. Interestingly, H425A-ACAT1 showed 59% of the wild-type activity, in contrast to its equivalent mutant, H399A-ACAT2. These results demonstrate that the histidine residues located at the active site are very crucial both for the catalytic activity of the enzyme and for distinguishing ACAT1 from ACAT2 with respect to enzyme catalysis and substrate specificity.

<ABSTRACT>
Decreased immune reactivity of isoforms of major allergens has been reported. However, such claims have always been based on experiments with recombinant proteins. This work describes the molecular and physicochemical characterization of a hevein (Hev b 6.0201) natural isoform (Hev b 6.0202), which is present in rubber latex from Hevea brasiliensis. The isoallergen has a single substitution Asn14Asp, which gives rise to local differences in the surface potential, as observed from the crystal structure presented here. Besides, ELISA inhibition using serum pools of adult and pediatric patients showed reduced IgE-binding capacity ( approximately 27%) with the isoallergen. Overall, these results are relevant to delineate crucial residues involved in this dominant discontinuous epitope.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
beta-Catenin is a structural component of adherens junctions, where it binds to the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin cell adhesion molecules. beta-Catenin is also a transcriptional coactivator in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it binds to Tcf/Lef family transcription factors. In the absence of a Wnt signal, nonjunctional beta-catenin is present in a multiprotein complex containing the proteins axin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), both of which bind directly to beta-catenin. The thermodynamics of beta-catenin binding to E-cadherin, Lef-1, APC, axin, and the transcriptional inhibitor ICAT have been determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. Most of the interactions showed large, unfavorable entropy changes, consistent with these ligands being natively unstructured in the absence of beta-catenin. Phosphorylation of serine residues present in a sequence motif common to cadherins and APC increased the affinity for beta-catenin 300-700-fold, and surface plasmon resonance measurements revealed that phosphorylation of E-cadherin both enhanced its on rate and decreased its off rate. The effects of the N- and C-terminal "tails" that flank the beta-catenin armadillo repeat domain on ligand binding have also been investigated using constructs lacking one or both tails. Contrary to earlier studies that employed less direct binding assays, the tails did not affect the affinity of beta-catenin for tight ligands such as E-cadherin, Lef-1, and phosphorylated APC. However, the beta-catenin C-terminal tail was found to decrease the affinity for the weaker ligands APC and axin, suggesting that this region may have a regulatory role in beta-catenin degradation.

<ABSTRACT>
To investigate the role of Glu196 of leucine aminopeptidase from Streptomyces griseus (SGAP) in SGAP activation by calcium and substrate specificity, we constructed E196X SGAP by saturation mutagenesis. Most mutations led to the abrogation of SGAP activation by calcium, and substitution with Lys led to a marked increase in activity toward Asp-p-nitroanilide (pNA) and a decrease in that toward Lys-pNA. A similar result was obtained from the investigation using non-calcium-activated enzyme from Streptomyces septatus (SSAP). These results indicate that Glu196 of SGAP is associated with the environment around the substrate binding site besides its role in SGAP activation by calcium.

RPE65 is an iron(II)-dependent isomerohydrolase in the retinoid visual
cycle.

<ABSTRACT>
The isomerization of all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis-retinol in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a critical step in the visual cycle and is essential for normal vision. Recently, we have established that protein RPE65 is the isomerohydrolase catalyzing this reaction. The present study investigated if metal ions are required for the isomerohydrolase activity of RPE65. The conversion of all-trans-[3H]retinol to 11-cis-[3H]retinol was used as the measure for isomerohydrolase activity. Metal chelators 2,2'-bipyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline both showed dose-dependent inhibitions of the isomerohydrolase activity in bovine RPE microsomes, with IC50 values of 0.5 and 0.2 mm, respectively. In the same reaction systems, however, lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) activity was not affected by these metal chelators. The isomerohydrolase activity inhibited by the metal chelators was restored by FeSO4 but not by CuSO4, ZnCl2, or MgCl2. Moreover, addition of Fe(III) citrate or FeCl3 did not restore the activity, indicating that Fe2+ is the metal ion essential for the isomerohydrolase activity. To confirm this result in recombinant RPE65, we expressed RPE65 in a 293A cell line stably expressing LRAT. In vitro activity assay showed that both metal chelators inhibited isomerohydrolase activity of recombinant RPE65. The addition of FeSO4 restored the enzymatic activity of the recombinant RPE65. Further, two specific iron-staining methods showed that purified RPE65 contains endogenous iron. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry measurements showed that bovine RPE65 binds iron ion with a stoichiometry of 0.8 +/- 0.1. These results indicate that RPE65 is an iron-dependent isomerohydrolase in the visual cycle.

A hPMS2 mutant cell line is defective in strand-specific mismatch repair.

<ABSTRACT>
Human cells contain several homologs of the bacterial mutL gene required for mismatch repair, including a gene on chromosome 7 designated hPMS2. We have identified an endometrial carcinoma cell line, HEC-1-A, that has a C-->T mutation in hPMS2 that generates a nonsense codon and yields a protein truncated at the C terminus. No wild-type gene or gene product was detected. The missing amino acids in hPMS2 are highly conserved among PMS homologs, suggesting that they may be critical for function. In support of this, extracts of HEC-1-A cells are defective in repairing a variety of mismatched substrates. Moreover, di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeated sequences are highly unstable in single cell clones of HEC-1-A cells, and HEC-1-A cells are resistant to killing by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The results provide strong experimental support for the involvement of the hPMS2 gene product in mismatch repair in human cells and support the concept that a defective hPMS2 gene may lead to predisposition to certain forms of cancer.

HSF1 down-regulates XAF1 through transcriptional regulation.

<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Studies have indicated the role of HSF1 (heat-shock transcription factor 1) in repressing the transcription of some nonheat shock genes. XAF1 (XIAP-associated factor 1) was an inhibitor of apoptosis-interacting protein with the effect of antagonizing the cytoprotective role of XIAP. XAF1 expression was lower in gastrointestinal cancers than in normal tissues with the mechanism unclear. Here we showed that gastrointestinal cancer tissues expressed higher levels of HSF1 than matched normal tissues. The expression of XAF1 and HSF1 was negatively correlated in gastrointestinal cancer cell lines. Stress stimuli, including heat, hypo-osmolarity, and H2O2, significantly suppressed the expression of XAF1, whereas the alteration of HSF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 expression. We cloned varying lengths of the 5'-flanking region of the XAF1 gene into luciferase reporter vectors, and we evaluated their promoter activities. A transcription silencer was found between the -592- and -1414-nucleotide region that was rich in nGAAn/nT-TCn elements (where n indicates G, A, T, or C). A high affinity and functional HSF1-binding element within the -862/-821-nucleotide region was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Inactivation of this "heat-shock element" by either site-directed mutation or an HSF1 inhibitor, pifithrin-alpha, restored the promoter activity of the silencer structure. Moreover, pretreatment with antioxidants suppressed HSF1 binding activity and increased the transcriptional activity and expression of XAF1. These findings suggested that endogenous stress pressure in cancer cells sustained the high level expression of HSF1 and subsequently suppressed XAF1 expression, implicating the synergized effect of two anti-apoptotic protein families, HSP and inhibitors of apoptosis, in cytoprotection under stress circumstances.

<ABSTRACT>
The association of glucokinase with liver mitochondria has been reported [Danial et al. (2003) BAD and glucokinase reside in a mitochondrial complex that integrates glycolysis and apoptosis. Nature 424, 952-956]. We confirmed association of glucokinase immunoreactivity with rat liver mitochondria using Percoll gradient centrifugation and demonstrated its association with the 68 kDa regulatory protein (GKRP) but not with the binding protein phosphofructokinase-2/fructose bisphosphatase-2. Substrates and glucagon induced adaptive changes in the mitochondrial glucokinase/GKRP ratio suggesting a regulatory role for GKRP. Combined with previous observations that GKRP overexpression partially inhibits glycolysis [de la Iglesia et al. (2000) The role of the regulatory protein of glucokinase in the glucose sensory mechanism of the hepatocyte. J. Biol. Chem. 275, 10597-10603] these findings suggest that there may be distinct glycolytic pools of glucokinase.

HIC1 attenuates Wnt signaling by recruitment of TCF-4 and beta-catenin to
the nuclear bodies.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) gene is epigenetically inactivated in cancer, and in addition, the haploinsufficiency of HIC1 is linked to the development of human Miller-Dieker syndrome. HIC1 encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor that acts as a transcriptional repressor. Additionally, the HIC1 protein oligomerizes via the N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and forms discrete nuclear structures known as HIC1 bodies. Here, we provide evidence that HIC1 antagonizes the TCF/beta-catenin-mediated transcription in Wnt-stimulated cells. This appears to be due to the ability of HIC1 to associate with TCF-4 and to recruit TCF-4 and beta-catenin to the HIC1 bodies. As a result of the recruitment, both proteins are prevented from association with the TCF-binding elements of the Wnt-responsive genes. These data indicate that the intracellular amounts of HIC1 protein can modulate the level of the transcriptional stimulation of the genes regulated by canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

Musashi regulates the temporal order of mRNA translation during Xenopus
oocyte maturation.

<ABSTRACT>
A strict temporal order of maternal mRNA translation is essential for meiotic cell cycle progression in oocytes of the frog Xenopus laevis. The molecular mechanisms controlling the ordered pattern of mRNA translational activation have not been elucidated. We report a novel role for the neural stem cell regulatory protein, Musashi, in controlling the translational activation of the mRNA encoding the Mos proto-oncogene during meiotic cell cycle progression. We demonstrate that Musashi interacts specifically with the polyadenylation response element in the 3' untranslated region of the Mos mRNA and that this interaction is necessary for early Mos mRNA translational activation. A dominant inhibitory form of Musashi blocks maternal mRNA cytoplasmic polyadenylation and meiotic cell cycle progression. Our data suggest that Musashi is a target of the initiating progesterone signaling pathway and reveal that late cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-directed mRNA translation requires early, Musashi-dependent mRNA translation. These findings indicate that Musashi function is necessary to establish the temporal order of maternal mRNA translation during Xenopus meiotic cell cycle progression.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Potassium is an essential mineral element for plant growth and development. Although it is known that plants absorb and transport K+ through membrane transporters, it remains unclear how these transporters are regulated. Here we show that the protein kinase CIPK23, encoded by the LKS1 gene, regulates K+ uptake under low-K+ conditions. Lesion of LKS1 significantly reduced K+ uptake and caused leaf chlorosis and growth inhibition, whereas overexpression of LKS1 significantly enhanced K+ uptake and tolerance to low K+. We demonstrate that CIPK23 directly phosphorylates the K+ transporter AKT1 and further find that CIPK23 is activated by the binding of two calcineurin B-like proteins, CBL1 and CBL9. We propose a model in which the CBL1/9-CIPK23 pathway ensures activation of AKT1 and enhanced K+ uptake under low-K+ conditions.

Roles of the hydrophobic cavity and lid of LolA in the lipoprotein
transfer reaction in Escherichia coli.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
LolA, a periplasmic chaperone, binds to outer membrane-specific lipoproteins released from the inner membrane through the action of an ATP-binding cassette transporter, LolCDE and then transfers them to the outer membrane receptor LolB, thereby mediating the inner to outer membrane transport of lipoproteins. The crystal structure of free LolA revealed that it has an internal hydrophobic cavity, which is surrounded by hydrophobic residues and closed by a lid comprising alpha-helices. The hydrophobic cavity most likely represents the binding site for the lipid moiety of a lipoprotein. It is speculated that the lid undergoes opening and closing upon the binding and transfer of lipoproteins, respectively. To determine the functions of the hydrophobic cavity and lid in detail, 14 residues involved in the formation of these structures were subjected to random mutagenesis. Among the obtained 21 LolA derivatives that did not support growth, 14 were active as to the binding of lipoproteins but defective in the transfer of lipoproteins to LolB, causing the periplasmic accumulation of a lipoprotein as a complex with a LolA derivative. A LolA derivative, I93G, bound lipoproteins faster than wild-type LolA did, whereas it did not transfer associated lipoproteins to LolB. When I93G and wild type LolA co-existed, lipoproteins were bound only to I93G; which therefore exhibited a dominant negative property. Another derivative, L59R, was also defective in the transfer of lipoproteins to LolB but did not exhibit a dominant negative property. Taken together, these results indicate that both the hydrophobic cavity and the lid are critically important for not only the binding of lipoproteins but also their transfer.

A novel regulatory mechanism couples deoxyribonucleotide synthesis and DNA
replication in Escherichia coli.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We present evidence for a complex regulatory interplay between the initiation of DNA replication and deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. In Escherichia coli, the ATP-bound DnaA protein initiates chromosomal replication. Upon loading of the beta-clamp subunit (DnaN) of the replicase, DnaA is inactivated as its intrinsic ATPase activity is stimulated by the protein Hda. The beta-subunit acts as a matchmaker between Hda and DnaA. Chain elongation of DNA requires a sufficient supply of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), which are produced by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). We present evidence suggesting that the molecular switch from ATP-DnaA to ADP-DnaA is a critical step coordinating DNA replication with increased deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. Characterization of dnaA and dnaN mutations that result in a constitutively high expression of RNR reveal this mechanism. We propose that the nucleotide bound state of DnaA regulates the transcription of the genes encoding ribonucleotide reductase (nrdAB). Accordingly, the conversion of ATP-DnaA to ADP-DnaA after initiation and loading of the beta-subunit DnaN would allow increased nrdAB expression, and consequently, coordinated RNR synthesis and DNA replication during the cell cycle.

Complement: a novel factor in basal and ischemia-induced neurogenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
Through its involvement in inflammation, opsonization, and cytolysis, the complement protects against infectious agents. Although most of the complement proteins are synthesized in the central nervous system (CNS), the role of the complement system in the normal or ischemic CNS remains unclear. Here we demonstrate for the first time that neural progenitor cells and immature neurons express receptors for complement fragments C3a and C5a (C3a receptor (C3aR) and C5a receptor). Mice that are deficient in complement factor C3 (C3(-/-)) lack C3a and are unable to generate C5a through proteolytic cleavage of C5 by C5-convertase. Intriguingly, basal neurogenesis is decreased both in C3(-/-) mice and in mice lacking C3aR or mice treated with a C3aR antagonist. The C3(-/-) mice had impaired ischemia-induced neurogenesis both in the subventricular zone, the main source of neural progenitor cells in adult brain, and in the ischemic region, despite normal proliferative response and larger infarct volumes. Thus, in the adult mammalian CNS, complement activation products promote both basal and ischemia-induced neurogenesis.

Differential regulation and transcriptional control of immediate early
gene expression in forskolin-treated WEHI7.2 thymoma cells.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Agents that increase intracellular cAMP are frequently growth inhibitory for lymphocytes and induce apoptosis in cortical thymocytes by regulating gene expression. In the present study, immediate early gene expression was examined in WEHI7.2 thymoma cells undergoing cAMP-mediated apoptosis. Temporal differences in c-fos, junB, and inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) steady-state mRNA levels were observed after forskolin exposure. Maximal induction of c-fos and junB occurred within 1 h, returning to basal levels by 3.5 h. In contrast, a 1.5-h time lag was observed before ICER transcript levels increased, reaching maximal levels after 3.5 h. This rise in expression, correlating with the decrease in c-fos and junB levels, preceded apoptotic DNA fragmentation by 1.5 h. Transient expression of ICER promoter constructs demonstrated that cAMP responsiveness occurred through cAMP-autoregulatory response element (CARE)3/4, two of the four proposed response elements in the ICER promoter. In contrast to the cAMP-responsive cell line JEG-3, CARE1/2 was not functional for cAMP-activated transcription in WEHI7.2 cells. An observed differential binding pattern of WEHI and JEG nuclear extracts to these elements may account for the cell-specific differences in expression patterns. To determine the role of endogenous ICER in regulating gene expression, cells were treated with two sequential doses of forskolin after which ICER and c-fos mRNA levels were measured. The high levels of cAMP-induced ICER expression dramatically reduced a second induction of c-fos. These data suggest that ICER expression may function as an antioncogene to attenuate the expression of certain protooncogenes, thereby preventing transformation and oncogenesis due to continuous overexpression. Moreover, inhibition of growth-stimulatory genes may be required for the activation of the cell death machinery in specific cells.

<ABSTRACT>
A dynamic mathematical model was developed to describe the uptake of various carbohydrates (glucose, lactose, glycerol, sucrose, and galactose) in Escherichia coli. For validation a number of isogenic strains with defined mutations were used. By considering metabolic reactions as well as signal transduction processes influencing the relevant pathways, we were able to describe quantitatively the phenomenon of catabolite repression in E. coli. We verified model predictions by measuring time courses of several extra- and intracellular components such as glycolytic intermediates, EII-ACrr phosphorylation level, both LacZ and PtsG concentrations, and total cAMP concentrations under various growth conditions. The entire data base consists of 18 experiments performed with nine different strains. The model describes the expression of 17 key enzymes, 38 enzymatic reactions, and the dynamic behavior of more than 50 metabolites. The different phenomena affecting the phosphorylation level of EIIACrr, the key regulation molecule for inducer exclusion and catabolite repression in enteric bacteria, can now be explained quantitatively.

<ABSTRACT>
The FOXM1 forkhead proteins, originally identified as M-phase phosphoproteins, are proliferation-associated transcriptional regulators involved in cell cycle progression, genetic stability and tumorigenesis. Here we demonstrate that Cyclin-dependent kinases regulate the transcriptional activity of FOXM1c. This is independent of an N-terminal negative regulatory domain and of the forkhead DNA binding domain. Instead we mapped the responsive sites in the transactivation domain. A combination of three phosphorylation sites mediates the Cyclin E and Cyclin A/CDK2 effects. Our findings provide evidence for a novel Cyclin E/CDK2 substrate that functions in cell cycle control.

<ABSTRACT>
Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) is an integral membrane protein anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum. It catalyzes the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids that are required for the synthesis of triglycerides, cholesteryl esters, and phospholipids. Four mouse isoforms of SCD (SCD1-4) and two human isoforms have been characterized. In the current study, we characterize the topology of the mouse SCD1 isoform. Hydropathy analysis of the 355-amino acid mouse SCD1 protein predicts that the protein contains four transmembrane domains (TMDs) and three loops connecting the membrane-spanning domains. To define the topology of the protein, recombinant SCD1 constructs containing epitope tags were transiently expressed in HeLa cells and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence and cysteine derivatization. Our data provide evidence that the N and C termini of SCD1 are oriented toward the cytosol with four transmembrane domains separated by two very short hydrophilic loops in the ER lumen and one large hydrophilic loop in the cytosol. In addition, based on the previous observation that SCD is a thiol enzyme, we sought to investigate whether the cysteine residues were essential for enzyme activity through mutagenesis studies, and our data suggest that the cysteines in SCD are not catalytically essential.

Aggrecan turnover in human intervertebral disc as determined by the

<ABSTRACT>
We have used the racemization of aspartic acid as a marker for the "molecular age" of aggrecan components of the human intervertebral disc matrix (aggregating and non-aggregating proteoglycans as well as the different buoyant density fractions of aggrecan). By measuring the D/L(Asp) ratio of the various aggrecan species as a function of age and using the values of the racemization constant, k(i), found earlier for aggrecan in articular cartilage, we were able to establish directly the relative residence time of these molecules in human intervertebral disc matrix. For A1 preparations taken from normal tissue, turnover rates of 0.059 +/- 0.01 and 0.063 +/- 0.01/year correspond to half-life values of 12 +/- 2.0 and 11.23 +/- 1.9 years for nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus, respectively; the turnover rates of 0.084 +/- 0.022 and 0.092 +/- 0.034/year for degenerate tissue correspond to half-life values of 8.77 +/- 2.2 and 8.41 +/- 2.8 years, suggesting increased rate of removal of small aggrecan fragments. For the large monomer, fraction A1D1, turnover is 0.13 +/- 0.04/year, corresponding to a half-life of 5.56 +/- 1.58 years, similar to 3.4 years in human articular cartilage. For the binding region (A1D6), turnover is 0.033 +/- 0.0012/year, corresponding to a half-life of 21.53 +/- 0.6 years, similar to 23.5 years in articular cartilage. A1 preparations from nucleus pulposus contain a lower proportion of aggregating proteoglycans as compared with annulus fibrosus, suggesting increased proteolytic modification in the nucleus pulposus. D/L(Asp) values in aggregating and non-aggregating proteoglycans of a 24-year-old individual show similar results, suggesting that the non-aggregating molecules are synthesized initially as aggregating proteoglycans, which thereafter undergo cleavage and detachment from hyaluronan.

The phi29 DNA polymerase:protein-primer structure suggests a model for the
initiation to elongation transition.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The absolute requirement for primers in the initiation of DNA synthesis poses a problem for replicating the ends of linear chromosomes. The DNA polymerase of bacteriophage phi29 solves this problem by using a serine hydroxyl of terminal protein to prime replication. The 3.0 A resolution structure shows one domain of terminal protein making no interactions, a second binding the polymerase and a third domain containing the priming serine occupying the same binding cleft in the polymerase as duplex DNA does during elongation. Thus, the progressively elongating DNA duplex product must displace this priming domain. Further, this heterodimer of polymerase and terminal protein cannot accommodate upstream template DNA, thereby explaining its specificity for initiating DNA synthesis only at the ends of the bacteriophage genome. We propose a model for the transition from the initiation to the elongation phases in which the priming domain of terminal protein moves out of the active site as polymerase elongates the primer strand. The model indicates that terminal protein should dissociate from polymerase after the incorporation of approximately six nucleotides.

Hypothyroidism reduces tricarboxylate carrier activity and expression in
rat liver mitochondria by reducing nuclear transcription rate and splicing
efficiency.

<ABSTRACT>
The tricarboxylate carrier (TCC), also known as citrate carrier, is an integral protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane. It is an essential component of the shuttle system by which mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, primer for both fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, is transported into the cytosol, where lipogenesis occurs. The effect of hypothyroidism on the activity and expression of the hepatic mitochondrial TCC was investigated in this study. TCC activity was significantly decreased in hypothyroid rats as compared with euthyroid animals. This hormone deficiency effect was due to a reduction in the amount of carrier protein, which resulted from a proportionate decrease of the specific mRNA. Hypothyroidism did not influence TCC mRNA stability. On the other hand, nuclear run-on assay revealed that the transcriptional rate of TCC mRNA decreased by approximately 40% in the nuclei from hypothyroid versus euthyroid rats. In addition, the ribonuclease protection assay showed that, in the nuclei of hypothyroid rats, the ratio of mature to precursor RNA decreased, indicating that the splicing of TCC RNA is affected. Furthermore, we found that the ratio of polyadenylated/unpolyadenylated TCC RNA as well as the length of the TCC RNA poly(A) tail were similar in both euthyroid and hypothyroid rats. Thus, the rate of formation of the TCC 3'-end is not altered in hypothyroidism. These results suggest that hypothyroidism affects TCC expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.

<ABSTRACT>
Acyl-CoA synthetases that activate fatty acids to their CoA derivatives play a central role in fatty acid metabolism. ACSBG1, an acyl-CoA synthetase originally identified in the fruit fly mutant bubblegum, was hypothesized to contribute to the biochemical pathology of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. We looked for homologous proteins and identified ACSBG2 in humans, mice, and rats. Human ACSBG1 and ACSBG2 amino acid sequences are 50% identical. ACSBG2 expression was confined to the testis and brainstem. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization studies further localized ACSBG2 expression to testicular Sertoli cells and large motoneurons in the medulla oblongata and cervical spinal cord. Full-length cDNA encoding human and mouse ACSBG2 was cloned. In transfected COS-1 cells, both human and murine ACSBG2 were detected as 75- to 80-kDa proteins by Western blot. Cells overexpressing ACSBG2 had increased ability to activate oleic acid (C18:1omega9) and linoleic acid (C18:2omega6) but not other fatty acid substrates tested. Within a highly conserved motif known to be important for catalysis, human ACSBG2 contains a histidine residue where all other known acyl-CoA synthetases, including mouse and rat ACSBG2, contain an arginine. This substitution resulted in a shift of the human ACSBG2 pH optimum to a more acidic pH. Mutation of this histidine to arginine improved catalytic function at neutral pH by shifting the pH profile without affecting substrate specificity. Although the role of ACSBG2 in testicular and neuronal lipid metabolism remains unclear, the limited tissue expression pattern and limited substrate specificity rule out a likely role for this enzyme in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy pathology.

Role of SGT1 in resistance protein accumulation in plant immunity.

<ABSTRACT>
A highly conserved eukaryotic protein SGT1 binds specifically to the molecular chaperone, HSP90. In plants, SGT1 positively regulates disease resistance conferred by many Resistance (R) proteins and developmental responses to the phytohormone, auxin. We show that silencing of SGT1 in Nicotiana benthamiana causes a reduction in steady-state levels of the R protein, Rx. These data support a role of SGT1 in R protein accumulation, possibly at the level of complex assembly. In Arabidopsis, two SGT1 proteins, AtSGT1a and AtSGT1b, are functionally redundant early in development. AtSGT1a and AtSGT1b are induced in leaves upon infection and either protein can function in resistance once a certain level is attained, depending on the R protein tested. In unchallenged tissues, steady-state AtSGT1b levels are at least four times greater than AtSGT1a. While the respective tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains of SGT1a and SGT1b control protein accumulation, they are dispensable for intrinsic functions of SGT1 in resistance and auxin responses.

<ABSTRACT>
Cell envelope lipids play an important role in the pathogenicity of mycobacteria, but the mechanisms by which they are transported to the outer membrane of these prokaryotes are largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence that LppX is a lipoprotein required for the translocation of complex lipids, the phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM), to the outer membrane of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Abolition of DIM transport following disruption of the lppX gene is accompanied by an important attenuation of the virulence of the tubercle bacillus. The crystal structure of LppX unveils an U-shaped beta-half-barrel dominated by a large hydrophobic cavity suitable to accommodate a single DIM molecule. LppX shares a similar fold with the periplasmic molecular chaperone LolA and the outer membrane lipoprotein LolB, which are involved in the localization of lipoproteins to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Based on the structure and although an indirect participation of LppX in DIM transport cannot yet be ruled out, we propose LppX to be the first characterized member of a family of structurally related lipoproteins that carry lipophilic molecules across the mycobacterial cell envelope.

FilGAP, a Rho- and ROCK-regulated GAP for Rac binds filamin A to control
actin remodelling.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
FilGAP is a newly recognized filamin A (FLNa)-binding RhoGTPase-activating protein. The GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity of FilGAP is specific for Rac and FLNa binding targets FilGAP to sites of membrane protrusion, where it antagonizes Rac in vivo. Dominant-negative FilGAP constructs lacking GAP activity or knockdown of endogenous FilGAP by small interference RNA (siRNA) induce spontaneous lamellae formation and stimulate cell spreading on fibronectin. Knockdown of endogenous FilGAP abrogates ROCK-dependent suppression of lamellae. Conversely, forced expression of FilGAP induces numerous blebs around the cell periphery and a ROCK-specific inhibitor suppresses bleb formation. ROCK phosphorylates FilGAP, and this phosphorylation stimulates its RacGAP activity and is a requirement for FilGAP-mediated bleb formation. FilGAP is, therefore, a mediator of the well-established antagonism of Rac by RhoA that suppresses leading edge protrusion and promotes cell retraction to achieve cellular polarity.

<ABSTRACT>
Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) with Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes is increasing worldwide. Nosocomial outbreak-derived (hospital-acquired) MRSA (HA-MRSA) in Japan in the 1980s was also largely PVL(+). PVL(+) HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA shared the same multi-locus sequence type (ST30) and methicillin resistance cassette (SCCmecIV), but were divergent in oxacillin resistance, spa typing, PFGE analysis or clfA gene analysis. PVL(+) HA-MRSA, which probably originated in PVL(+)S. aureus ST30, was highly adhesive (carrying cna and bbp genes), highly-toxic (carrying luk(PV) and sea genes) and highly drug-resistant. PVL(+) HA-MRSA was once replaced by other PVL(-) HA-MRSA (e.g., ST5), and is re-emerging as CA-MRSA.

<ABSTRACT>
Recent developments in purification strategies, together with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, have identified numerous in vivo protein complexes and suggest the existence of many others. Standard proteomics techniques are, however, unable to describe the overall stoichiometry, subunit interactions and organization of these assemblies, because many are heterogeneous, are present at relatively low cellular abundance and are frequently difficult to isolate. We combine two existing methodologies to tackle these challenges: tandem affinity purification to isolate sufficient quantities of highly pure native complexes, and MS of the intact assemblies and subcomplexes to determine their structural organization. We optimized our protocol with two protein assemblies from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (scavenger decapping and nuclear cap-binding complexes), establishing subunit stoichiometry and identifying substoichiometric binding. We then targeted the yeast exosome, a nuclease with ten different subunits, and found that by generating subcomplexes, a three-dimensional interaction map could be derived, demonstrating the utility of our approach for large, heterogeneous cellular complexes.

<ABSTRACT>
The placenta is susceptible to diverse insults during human pregnancy. The expression of the protein N-myc down-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is regulated during cell proliferation, differentiation, and in response to stress. Nevertheless, the function of this protein in humans remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that NDRG1 is up-regulated in hypoxic primary human trophoblasts and that NDRG1 modulates trophoblast response to hypoxia. We initially demonstrated that the expression of NDRG1 is enhanced in primary human trophoblasts exposed to hypoxia. Importantly, we found a similar increase in NDRG1 expression in placental samples derived from either singleton gestations complicated by intrauterine growth restriction or from dizygotic twin gestation where one twin exhibited growth restriction. Having established efficient lentivirus-mediated transfection of primary human trophoblasts, we overexpressed NDRG1 in trophoblasts, which resulted in enhanced trophoblast differentiation. In contrast, lentivirus-driven short interfering RNA-mediated silencing of NDRG1 diminished trophoblast viability and differentiation. Consistent with these results, NDRG1 reduced the expression level of p53 in trophoblasts cultured in standard or hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, NDRG1 expression was regulated by the activity of SIRT1 (Sir2-like protein 1), which promotes cell survival. Together, our data indicate that NDRG1 interacts with SIRT1/p53 signaling to attenuate hypoxic injury in human trophoblasts.

<ABSTRACT>
Cyclophilin 40 (CyP40), an immunophilin cochaperone present in steroid receptor-Hsp90 complexes, contains an N-terminal peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain separated from a C-terminal Hsp90-binding tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain by a 30-residue linker. To map CyP40 chaperone function, CyP40 deletion mutants were prepared and analysed for chaperone activity. CyP40 fragments containing the PPIase domain plus linker or the linker region and the adjoining TPR domain retained chaperone activity, whilst individually, the catalytic and TPR domains were devoid of chaperoning ability. CyP40 chaperone function then, is localized within the linker that forms a binding cleft with potential to accommodate non-native substrates.

ATM and ATR promote Mre11 dependent restart of collapsed replication forks

<ABSTRACT>
Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ataxia-telangiectasia Rad3-related (ATR) and the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex ensure genome stability in response to DNA damage. However, their essential role in DNA metabolism remains unknown. Here we show that ATM and ATR prevent accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during chromosomal replication. Replicating chromosomes accumulate DSBs in Xenopus laevis egg extracts depleted of ATM and ATR. Addition of ATM and ATR proteins to depleted extracts prevents DSB accumulation by promoting restart of collapsed replication forks that arise during DNA replication. We show that collapsed forks maintain MCM complex but lose Pol epsilon, and that Pol epsilon reloading requires ATM and ATR. Replication fork restart is abolished in Mre11 depleted extracts and is restored by supplementation with recombinant human Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex. Using a novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based technique, we demonstrate that ATM and ATR induce Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex redistribution to restarting forks. This study provides direct biochemical evidence that ATM and ATR prevent accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities by promoting Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 dependent recovery of collapsed replication forks.

Opposing effects of the UV lesion repair protein XPA and UV bypass
polymerase eta on ATR checkpoint signaling.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
An essential component of the ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related)-activating structure is single-stranded DNA. It has been suggested that nucleotide excision repair (NER) can lead to activation of ATR by generating such a signal, and in yeast, DNA damage processing through the NER pathway is necessary for checkpoint activation during G1. We show here that ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced ATR signaling is compromised in XPA-deficient human cells during S phase, as shown by defects in ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein) translocation to sites of UV damage, UV-induced phosphorylation of Chk1 and UV-induced replication protein A phosphorylation and chromatin binding. However, ATR signaling was not compromised in XPC-, CSB-, XPF- and XPG-deficient cells. These results indicate that damage processing is not necessary for ATR-mediated S-phase checkpoint activation and that the lesion recognition function of XPA may be sufficient. In contrast, XP-V cells deficient in the UV bypass polymerase eta exhibited enhanced ATR signaling. Taken together, these results suggest that lesion bypass and not lesion repair may raise the level of UV damage that can be tolerated before checkpoint activation, and that XPA plays a critical role in this activation.

Structural basis for Gas6-Axl signalling.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Receptor tyrosine kinases of the Axl family are activated by the vitamin K-dependent protein Gas6. Axl signalling plays important roles in cancer, spermatogenesis, immunity, and platelet function. The crystal structure at 3.3 A resolution of a minimal human Gas6/Axl complex reveals an assembly of 2:2 stoichiometry, in which the two immunoglobulin-like domains of the Axl ectodomain are crosslinked by the first laminin G-like domain of Gas6, with no direct Axl/Axl or Gas6/Gas6 contacts. There are two distinct Gas6/Axl contacts of very different size, both featuring interactions between edge beta-strands. Structure-based mutagenesis, protein binding assays and receptor activation experiments demonstrate that both the major and minor Gas6 binding sites are required for productive transmembrane signalling. Gas6-mediated Axl dimerisation is likely to occur in two steps, with a high-affinity 1:1 Gas6/Axl complex forming first. Only the minor Gas6 binding site is highly conserved in the other Axl family receptors, Sky/Tyro3 and Mer. Specificity at the major contact is suggested to result from the segregation of charged and apolar residues to opposite faces of the newly formed beta-sheet.

<ABSTRACT>
Gfh1, a transcription factor from Thermus thermophilus, inhibits all catalytic activities of RNA polymerase (RNAP). We characterized the Gfh1 structure, function and possible mechanism of action and regulation. Gfh1 inhibits RNAP by competing with NTPs for coordinating the active site Mg2+ ion. This coordination requires at least two aspartates at the tip of the Gfh1 N-terminal coiled-coil domain (NTD). The overall structure of Gfh1 is similar to that of the Escherichia coli transcript cleavage factor GreA, except for the flipped orientation of the C-terminal domain (CTD). We show that depending on pH, Gfh1-CTD exists in two alternative orientations. At pH above 7, it assumes an inactive 'flipped' orientation seen in the structure, which prevents Gfh1 from binding to RNAP. At lower pH, Gfh1-CTD switches to an active 'Gre-like' orientation, which enables Gfh1 to bind to and inhibit RNAP.

<ABSTRACT>
Autotransporter proteins are defined by the ability to drive their own secretion across the bacterial outer membrane. The Hia autotransporter of Haemophilus influenzae belongs to the trimeric autotransporter subfamily and mediates bacterial adhesion to the respiratory epithelium. In this report, we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal end of Hia, corresponding to the entire Hia translocator domain and part of the passenger domain (residues 992-1098). This domain forms a beta-barrel with 12 transmembrane beta-strands, including four strands from each subunit. The beta-barrel has a central channel of 1.8 nm in diameter that is traversed by three N-terminal alpha-helices, one from each subunit. Mutagenesis studies demonstrate that the transmembrane portion of the three alpha-helices and the loop region between the alpha-helices and the neighboring beta-strands are essential for stability of the trimeric structure of the translocator domain, and that trimerization of the translocator domain is a prerequisite for translocator activity. Overall, this study provides important insights into the mechanism of translocation in trimeric autotransporters.

<ABSTRACT>
The kinetics of initiator transfer RNA (tRNA) interaction with the messenger RNA (mRNA)-programmed 30S subunit and the rate of 50S subunit docking to the 30S preinitiation complex were measured for different combinations of initiation factors in a cell-free Escherichia coli system for protein synthesis with components of high purity. The major results are summarized by a Michaelis-Menten scheme for initiation. All three initiation factors are required for maximal efficiency (kcat/KM) of initiation and for maximal in vivo rate of initiation at normal concentration of initiator tRNA. Spontaneous release of IF3 from the 30S preinitiation complex is required for subunit docking. The presence of initiator tRNA on the 30S subunit greatly increases the rate of 70S ribosome formation by increasing the rate of IF3 dissociation from the 30S subunit and the rate of 50S subunit docking to the IF3-free 30S preinitiation complex. The reasons why IF1 and IF3 are essential in E. coli are discussed in the light of the present observations.

The Eyes Absent (Eya) proteins are tyrosine phosphatases and transcriptional activators involved in cell-fate determination and organ development. Mutations in the gene encoding Eya homologue 1 have been implicated in the multi-organ developmental disorder branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR) and in ocular defects. Here we report that BOR-associated mutations lead to a loss of phosphatase activity in Eya1 proteins, while mutations associated with ocular defects yield Eya1 proteins with near normal levels of phosphatase activity. Furthermore we demonstrate that the N-terminal domain attenuates the catalytic activity of Eya suggesting a mechanism of regulation.

<ABSTRACT>
The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are thought to exert their function through the recruitment of interacting-proteins to the ubiquitin/proteasome degradation pathway. All SOCS proteins bind an Elongin BC E3 ubiquitin ligase complex through the common Socs-box. Here, we show that haem-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase-1 (HOIL-1), another E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacts with SOCS6. The Ubl domain of HOIL-1 and the SH2 and Socs-box domains of SOCS6 are required for the interaction. HOIL-1 expression stabilizes SOCS6 and induces the ubiquitination and degradation of proteins associated with SOCS6. These data suggest that SOCS proteins may interact with different E3 ubiquitin ligases in addition to a common Elongin BC E3 complex.

Structure of complement factor H carboxyl-terminus reveals molecular basis
of atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Factor H (FH) is the key regulator of the alternative pathway of complement. The carboxyl-terminal domains 19-20 of FH interact with the major opsonin C3b, glycosaminoglycans, and endothelial cells. Mutations within this area are associated with atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), a disease characterized by damage to endothelial cells, erythrocytes, and kidney glomeruli. The structure of recombinant FH19-20, solved at 1.8 A by X-ray crystallography, reveals that the short consensus repeat domain 20 contains, unusually, a short alpha-helix, and a patch of basic residues at its base. Most aHUS-associated mutations either destabilize the structure or cluster in a unique region on the surface of FH20. This region is close to, but distinct from, the primary heparin-binding patch of basic residues. By mutating five residues in this region, we show that it is involved, not in heparin, but in C3b binding. Therefore, the majority of the aHUS-associated mutations on the surface of FH19-20 interfere with the interaction between FH and C3b. This obviously leads to impaired control of complement attack on plasma-exposed cell surfaces in aHUS.

<ABSTRACT>
Although much is known about environmental factors that predispose individuals to hypertension and cardiovascular disease, little information is available regarding the genetic and signaling events involved. Indeed, few genes associated with the progression of these pathologies have been discovered despite intensive research in animal models and human populations. Here we identify Vav3, a GDP-GTP exchange factor that stimulates Rho and Rac GTPases, as an essential factor regulating the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system. Vav3-deficient mice exhibited tachycardia, systemic arterial hypertension and extensive cardiovascular remodeling. These mice also showed hyperactivity of sympathetic neurons from the time of birth. The high catecholamine levels associated with this condition led to the activation of the renin-angiotensin system, increased levels of kidney-related hormones and the progressive loss of cardiovascular and renal homeostasis. Pharmacological studies with drugs targeting sympathetic and renin-angiotensin responses confirmed the causative role and hierarchy of these events in the development of the Vav3-null mouse phenotype. These observations uncover the crucial role of Vav3 in the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and cardiovascular physiology, and reveal a signaling pathway that could be involved in the pathophysiology of human disease states involving tachycardia and sympathetic hyperactivity with unknown etiologies.

<ABSTRACT>
Granzyme A (GzmA) induces caspase-independent cell death with morphological features of apoptosis. Here, we show that GzmA at nanomolar concentrations cleaves Ku70, a key double-strand break repair (DSBR) protein, in target cells. Ku70 is cut after Arg(301), disrupting Ku complex binding to DNA. Cleaving Ku70 facilitates GzmA-mediated cell death, as silencing Ku70 by RNA interference increases DNA damage and cell death by GzmB cluster-deficient cytotoxic T lymphocytes or by GzmA and perforin, whereas Ku70 overexpression has the opposite effect. Ku70 has two known antiapoptotic effects-facilitating DSBR and sequestering bax to prevent its translocation to mitochondria. However, GzmA triggers single-stranded, not double-stranded, DNA damage, and GzmA-induced cell death does not involve bax. Therefore, Ku70 has other antiapoptotic functions in GzmA-induced cell death, which are blocked when GzmA proteolyses Ku70.

Identification of HAX-1 as a protein that binds bile salt export protein

kidney cells.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type proteins are essential for bile formation in vertebrate liver. BSEP, MDR1, MDR2, and MRP2 ABC transporters are targeted to the apical (canalicular) membrane of hepatocytes where they execute ATP-dependent transport of bile acids, drugs, amphipathic cations, phospholipids, and conjugated organic anions, respectively. Changes in activity and abundance of transporters in the canalicular membrane regulate bile flow; however, little is known regarding cellular proteins that bind ABC transporters and regulate their trafficking. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified HAX-1 as a binding partner for BSEP, MDR1, and MDR2. The interactions were validated biochemically by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. BSEP and HAX-1 were over-represented in rat liver subcellular fractions enriched for canalicular membrane vesicles, microsomes, and clathrin-coated vesicles. HAX-1 was bound to BSEP, MDR1, and MDR2 in canalicular membrane vesicles and co-localized with BSEP and MDR1 in the apical membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. RNA interference of HAX-1 increased BSEP levels in the apical membrane of MDCK cells by 71%. Pulse-chase studies indicated that HAX-1 depletion did not affect BSEP translation, post-translational modification, delivery to the plasma membrane, or half-life. HAX-1 depletion resulted in an increased peak of metabolically labeled apical membrane BSEP at 4 h and enhanced retention at 6 and 9 h. HAX-1 also interacts with cortactin. Expression of dominant negative cortactin increased steady state levels of BSEP 2-fold in the apical membrane of MDCK cells, as did expression of dominant negative EPS15. These findings suggest that HAX-1 and cortactin participate in BSEP internalization from the apical membrane.

<ABSTRACT>
Cone snail venom is a rich source of bioactives, in particular small disulfide rich peptides that disrupt synaptic transmission. Here, we report the discovery of conomap-Vt (Conp-Vt), an unusual linear tetradecapeptide isolated from Conus vitulinus venom. The sequence displays no homology to known conopeptides, but displays significant homology to peptides of the MATP (myoactive tetradecapeptide) family, which are important endogenous neuromodulators in molluscs, annelids and insects. Conp-Vt showed potent excitatory activity in several snail isolated tissue preparations. Similar to ACh, repeated doses of Conp-Vt were tachyphylactic. Since nicotinic and muscarinic antagonists failed to block its effect and Conp-Vt desensitised tissue remained responsive to ACh, it appears that Conp-Vt contractions were non-cholinergic in origin. Finally, biochemical studies revealed that Conp-Vt is the first member of the MATP family with a d-amino acid. Interestingly, the isomerization of L-Phe to D-Phe enhanced biological activity, suggesting that this post-translational modified conopeptide may have evolved for prey capture.

<ABSTRACT>
Here we describe the association of the synaptosomal plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) from pig cerebellum with cholesterol/sphingomyelin-rich membrane domains (rafts). The PMCA4 was localized exclusively in rafts prepared by flotation in Nycodenz density gradients of ice-cold Brij 96 extracts. This was corroborated by its colocalization with the raft markers cholesterol, ganglioside GM1, and PrP(C). The remaining PMCA isoforms were found in the detergent-soluble fractions, with the majority of the membrane proteins. Activity assays confirmed the bimodal distribution of the PMCA isoforms in the density gradient, with a lower activity for PMCA4 and greater stimulation by calmodulin than for the other isoforms. By providing an ordered membrane microenvironment, lipid rafts may contribute to the interaction of PMCA4 with proteins involved in Ca2+ signaling at discrete functional positions on the synaptic nerve terminals.

<ABSTRACT>
Salt sensitivity of antimicrobial peptides poses a major obstacle in their development as novel antibiotics. Here we report the use of helix-capping motifs to confer salt resistance upon helical antimicrobial peptides. The helical content of the template peptide [RLLR](5) was almost completely destroyed at salt concentrations over 200 mm NaCl, leading to a 8-32-fold decrease in antimicrobial activity. However, the introduction of helix-capping motifs at the helix termini resulted in a structurally stable peptide, which retained membrane-permeabilizing and antimicrobial activities upon exposure to salt. Furthermore, the peptide with helix-capping motifs directly inhibited the in vivo growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, which causes localized fasciitis in mice, and prevented the necrosis of the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous muscle layers. Results indicate that the adoption of helix-capping motifs into salt-sensitive antimicrobial peptides provides the necessary structural stability for the peptides to permeabilize cell membranes and cause cell death at physiological salt concentrations.

<ABSTRACT>
Guidance molecules have attracted interest by demonstration that they regulate patterning of the blood vascular system during development. However, their significance during postnatal angiogenesis has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that endothelial cells of human malignant brain tumors also express guidance molecules, such as EphB4 and its ligand ephrinB2. To study their function, EphB4 variants were overexpressed in blood vessels of tumor xenografts. Our studies revealed that EphB4 acts as a negative regulator of blood vessel branching and vascular network formation, switching the vascularization program from sprouting angiogenesis to circumferential vessel growth. In parallel, EphB4 reduces the permeability of the tumor vascular system via activation of the angiopoietin-1/Tie2 system at the endothelium/pericyte interface. Furthermore, overexpression of EphB4 variants in blood vessels during (i) vascularization of non-neoplastic cell grafts and (ii) retinal vascularization revealed that these functions of EphB4 apply to postnatal, non-neoplastic angiogenesis in general. This implies that both neoplastic and non-neoplastic vascularization is driven not only by a vascular initiation program but also by a vascular patterning program mediated by guidance molecules.

Flagellar motility is required for the viability of the bloodstream

<ABSTRACT>
The 9 + 2 microtubule axoneme of flagella and cilia represents one of the most iconic structures built by eukaryotic cells and organisms. Both unity and diversity are present among cilia and flagella on the evolutionary as well as the developmental scale. Some cilia are motile, whereas others function as sensory organelles and can variously possess 9 + 2 and 9 + 0 axonemes and other associated structures. How such unity and diversity are reflected in molecular repertoires is unclear. The flagellated protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, causing devastating disease in humans and other animals. There is little hope of a vaccine for African sleeping sickness and a desperate need for modern drug therapies. Here we present a detailed proteomic analysis of the trypanosome flagellum. RNA interference (RNAi)-based interrogation of this proteome provides functional insights into human ciliary diseases and establishes that flagellar function is essential to the bloodstream-form trypanosome. We show that RNAi-mediated ablation of various proteins identified in the trypanosome flagellar proteome leads to a rapid and marked failure of cytokinesis in bloodstream-form (but not procyclic insect-form) trypanosomes, suggesting that impairment of flagellar function may provide a method of disease control. A postgenomic meta-analysis, comparing the evolutionarily ancient trypanosome with other eukaryotes including humans, identifies numerous trypanosome-specific flagellar proteins, suggesting new avenues for selective intervention.

The physical properties of the capsular polysaccharides from Cryptococcus
neoformans suggest features for capsule construction.
</TITLE>

<ABSTRACT>
The most distinctive feature of the human pathogenic fungus is a polysaccharide capsule that is essential for virulence and is composed primarily of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and galactoxylomannan (GalXM). GXM mediates multiple deleterious effects on host immune function, yet relatively little is known about its physical properties. The average mass of Cryptococcus neoformans GXM from four antigenically different strains ranged from 1.7 to 7 x 10(6) daltons as calculated from Zimm plots of light-scattering data. GalXM was significantly smaller than GXM, with an average mass of 1 x 10(5) daltons. These molecular masses imply that GalXM is the most numerous polysaccharide in the capsule on a molar basis. The radius of gyration of the capsular polysaccharides ranged between 68 and 208 nm. Viscosity measurements suggest that neither polysaccharide altered fluid dynamics during infection since GXM behaved in solution as a polyelectrolyte and GalXM did not increase solution viscosity. Immunoblot analysis indicated heterogeneity within GXM. In agreement with this, scanning transmission electron microscopy of GXM preparations revealed a tangled network of two different types of molecules. Mass per length measurements from light scattering and scanning transmission electron microscopy were consistent and suggested GXM molecules self-associate. A mechanism for capsule growth is proposed based on the extracellular release and entanglement of GXM molecules.

The mTOR/PI3K and MAPK pathways converge on eIF4B to control its
phosphorylation and activity.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) plays a critical role in recruiting the 40S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA. In response to insulin, eIF4B is phosphorylated on Ser422 by S6K in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. Here we demonstrate that the p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RSK) phosphorylates eIF4B on the same residue. The relative contribution of the RSK and S6K modules to the phosphorylation of eIF4B is growth factor-dependent, and the two phosphorylation events exhibit very different kinetics. The S6K and RSK proteins are members of the AGC protein kinase family, and require PDK1 phosphorylation for activation. Consistent with this requirement, phosphorylation of eIF4B Ser422 is abrogated in PDK1 null embryonic stem cells. Phosphorylation of eIF4B on Ser422 by RSK and S6K is physiologically significant, as it increases the interaction of eIF4B with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3.

GINS, a central nexus in the archaeal DNA replication fork.

<ABSTRACT>
In eukaryotes, the GINS complex is essential for DNA replication and has been implicated as having a role at the replication fork. This complex consists of four paralogous GINS subunits, Psf1, Psf2, Psf3 and Sld5. Here, we identify an archaeal GINS homologue as a direct interaction partner of the MCM helicase. The core archaeal GINS complex contains two subunits that are poorly conserved homologues of the eukaryotic GINS subunits, in complex with a protein containing a domain homologous to the DNA-binding domain of bacterial RecJ. Interaction studies show that archaeal GINS interacts directly with the heterodimeric core primase. Our data suggest that GINS is important in coordinating the architecture of the replication fork and provide a mechanism to couple progression of the MCM helicase on the leading strand with priming events on the lagging strand.

High-resolution analysis of chromosome rearrangements on 8p in breast,

<ABSTRACT>
The short arm of chromosome 8, 8p, is often rearranged in carcinomas, typically showing distal loss by unbalanced translocation. We analysed 8p rearrangements in 48 breast, pancreatic and colon cancer cell lines by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array comparative genomic hybridization, with a tiling path of 0.2 Mb resolution over 8p12 and 1 Mb resolution over chromosome 8. Selected breast lines (MDA-MB-134, MDA-MB-175, MDA-MB-361, T-47D and ZR-75-1) were analysed further. Most cell lines showed loss of 8p distal to a break that was between 31 Mb (5' to NRG1) and the centromere, but the translocations were accompanied by variable amplifications, deletions and inversions proximal to this break. The 8p12 translocation in T-47D was flanked by an inversion of 4 Mb, with a 100 kb deletion at the proximal end. The dicentric t(8;11) in ZR-75-1 carries multiple rearrangements including interstitial deletions, a triplicated translocation junction between NRG1 and a fragment of 11q (unconnected to CCND1), and two separate amplifications, of FGFR1 and CCND1 . We conclude that if there is a tumour suppressor gene on 8p it may be near 31 Mb, for example WRN; but the complexity of 8p rearrangements suggests that they target various genes proximal to 31 Mb including NRG1 and the amplicon centred around ZNF703/FLJ14299.Oncogene (2006) 25, 5693-5706. doi:10.1038/sj.onc.1209570; published online 24 April 2006.

antagonistic roles in cell cycle progression.

<ABSTRACT>
The histone acetyl transferase Tip60 (HTATIP) belongs to a multimolecular complex involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. Tip60 participates in cell cycle arrest following DNA damage by allowing p53 to activate p21CIP (p21) expression. We show here that Tip60 and the E1A-associated p400 protein (EP400), which belongs to the Tip60 complex, are also required for DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Tip60 favours the expression of some proapoptotic p53 target genes most likely through the stimulation of p53 DNA binding activity. In contrast, p400 represses p21 expression in unstressed cells, thereby allowing cell cycle progression and DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Tip60 and p400 have thus opposite effects on p21 expression in the absence of DNA damage. We further found that this antagonism relies on the inhibition of Tip60 function by p400, a property that is abolished following DNA damage. Therefore, taken together, our results indicate that Tip60 and p400 play distinct roles in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and underline the importance of the Tip60 complex and its regulation in the proper control of cell fate.

<ABSTRACT>
Chromatin insulators have been implicated in the establishment of independent gene expression domains and in the nuclear organization of chromatin. Post-translational modification of proteins by Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) has been reported to regulate their activity and subnuclear localization. We present evidence suggesting that two protein components of the gypsy chromatin insulator of Dorsophila melanogaster, Mod(mdg4)2.2 and CP190, are sumoylated, and that SUMO is associated with a subset of genomic insulator sites. Disruption of the SUMO conjugation pathway improves the enhancer-blocking function of a partially active insulator, indicating that SUMO modification acts to regulate negatively the activity of the gypsy insulator. Sumoylation does not affect the ability of CP190 and Mod(mdg4)2.2 to bind chromatin, but instead appears to regulate the nuclear organization of gypsy insulator complexes. The results suggest that long-range interactions of insulator proteins are inhibited by sumoylation and that the establishment of chromatin domains can be regulated by SUMO conjugation.

termination and reinitiation.

<ABSTRACT>
While initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) has been thoroughly investigated, molecular mechanisms driving transcription termination remain poorly understood. Here we describe how the characterization of the in vitro transcriptional properties of a Pol III variant (Pol IIIdelta), lacking the C11, C37, and C53 subunits, revealed crucial information about the mechanisms of Pol III termination and reinitiation. The specific requirement for the C37-C53 complex in terminator recognition was determined. This complex was demonstrated to slow down elongation by the enzyme, adding to the evidence implicating the elongation rate as a critical determinant of correct terminator recognition. In addition, the presence of the C37-C53 complex required the simultaneous addition of C11 to Pol IIIdelta for the enzyme to reinitiate after the first round of transcription, thus uncovering a role for polymerase subunits in the facilitated recycling process. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the role of C11 in recycling was independent of its role in RNA cleavage. The data presented allowed us to propose a model of Pol III termination and its links to reinitiation.

Calbindin-D28K dynamically controls TRPV5-mediated Ca2+ transport.

<ABSTRACT>
In Ca(2+)-transporting epithelia, calbindin-D(28K) (CaBP(28K)) facilitates Ca(2+) diffusion from the luminal Ca(2+) entry side of the cell to the basolateral side, where Ca(2+) is extruded into the extracellular compartment. Simultaneously, CaBP(28K) provides protection against toxic high Ca(2+) levels by buffering the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) during high Ca(2+) influx. CaBP(28K) consistently colocalizes with the epithelial Ca(2+) channel TRPV5, which constitutes the apical entry step in renal Ca(2+)-transporting epithelial cells. Here, we demonstrate using protein-binding analysis, subcellular fractionation and evanescent-field microscopy that CaBP(28K) translocates towards the plasma membrane and directly associates with TRPV5 at a low [Ca(2+)](i). (45)Ca(2+) uptake measurements, electrophysiological recordings and transcellular Ca(2+) transport assays of lentivirus-infected primary rabbit connecting tubule/distal convolute tubule cells revealed that associated CaBP(28K) tightly buffers the flux of Ca(2+) entering the cell via TRPV5, facilitating high Ca(2+) transport rates by preventing channel inactivation. In summary, CaBP(28K) acts in Ca(2+)-transporting epithelia as a dynamic Ca(2+) buffer, regulating [Ca(2+)] in close vicinity to the TRPV5 pore by direct association with the channel.

Lysosomal sialidase (neuraminidase-1) is targeted to the cell surface in a
multiprotein complex that facilitates elastic fiber assembly.

<ABSTRACT>
We have established previously that the 67-kDa elastin-binding protein (EBP), identical to the spliced variant of beta-galactosidase, acts as a recyclable chaperone that facilitates secretion of tropoelastin. (Hinek, A., Keeley, F. W., and Callahan, J. W. (1995) Exp. Cell Res. 220, 312-324). We now demonstrate that EBP also forms a cell surface-targeted molecular complex with protective protein/cathepsin A and sialidase (neuraminidase-1), and provide evidence that this sialidase activity is a prerequisite for the subsequent release of tropoelastin. We found that treatment with sialidase inhibitors repressed assembly of elastic fibers in cultures of human skin fibroblasts, aortic smooth muscle cells, and ear cartilage chondrocytes and caused impaired elastogenesis in developing chick embryos. Fibroblasts derived from patients with congenital sialidosis (primary deficiency of neuraminidase-1) and galactosialidosis (secondary deficiency of neuraminidase-1) demonstrated impaired elastogenesis, which could be reversed after their transduction with neuraminidase-1 cDNA or after treatment with bacterial sialidase, which has a similar substrate specificity to human neuraminidase-1. We postulate that neuraminidase-1 catalyzes removal of the terminal sialic acids from carbohydrate chains of microfibrillar glycoproteins and other adjacent matrix glycoconjugates, unmasking their penultimate galactosugars. In turn, the exposed galactosugars interact with the galectin domain of EBP, thereby inducing the release of transported tropoelastin molecules and facilitating their subsequent assembly into elastic fibers.

<ABSTRACT>
Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3beta is a multifunctional protein that positively regulates myocardial apoptosis and negatively regulates hypertrophy. However, the role of GSK3beta in the diabetic myocardium is largely unknown. We found that GSK3beta became more active (less phosphorylated at serine 9) via decreased Akt phosphorylation, in parallel to c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase activation, which correlated with increased activated caspase 3 and myocardial apoptosis 3 days after streptozotocin (STZ) injection in mice. However, 28 days after STZ injection, GSK3beta became inactive, which correlated with the enhanced protein kinase C beta2 and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase expression, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c3, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. All of the above parameters were exacerbated in dominant-negative 14-3-3 transgenic mice. Our results suggest that GSK3beta together with 14-3-3 protein plays essential roles in the signaling of diabetic cardiomyopathy, and treatment with either losartan or tempol prevents these changes.

receptor number.

<ABSTRACT>
Excitatory synapses in the brain exhibit a remarkable degree of functional plasticity, which largely reflects changes in the number of synaptic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). However, mechanisms involved in recruiting AMPARs to synapses are unknown. Here we use hippocampal slice cultures and biolistic gene transfections to study the targeting of AMPARs to synapses. We show that AMPARs are localized to synapses through direct binding of the first two PDZ domains of synaptic PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein of 95 kDa) to the AMPAR-associated protein, stargazin. Increasing the level of synaptic PSD-95 recruits new AMPARs to synapses without changing the number of surface AMPARs. At the same time, we show that stargazin overexpression drastically increases the number of extra-synaptic AMPARs, but fails to alter synaptic currents if synaptic PSD-95 levels are kept constant. Finally, we make compensatory mutations to both PSD-95 and stargazin to demonstrate the central role of direct interactions between them in determining the number of synaptic AMPARs.

Initiation of DNA repair mediated by a stalled RNA polymerase IIO.

<ABSTRACT>
The transcription-coupled repair (TCR) pathway preferentially repairs DNA damage located in the transcribed strand of an active gene. To gain insight into the coupling mechanism between transcription and repair, we have set up an in vitro system in which we isolate an elongating RNA pol IIO, which is stalled in front of a cisplatin adduct. This immobilized RNA pol IIO is used as 'bait' to sequentially recruit TFIIH, XPA, RPA, XPG and XPF repair factors in an ATP-dependent manner. This RNA pol IIO/repair complex allows the ATP-dependent removal of the lesion only in the presence of CSB, while the latter does not promote dual incision in an XPC-dependent nucleotide excision repair reaction. In parallel to the dual incision, the repair factors also allow the partial release of RNA pol IIO. In this 'minimal TCR system', the RNA pol IIO can effectively act as a loading point for all the repair factors required to eliminate a transcription-blocking lesion.

<ABSTRACT>
Recent analyses have shown that the activity of the yeast nuclear exosome is stimulated by the Trf4p-Air1/2p-Mtr4p polyadenylation (TRAMP) complex. Here, we report that strains lacking the Rrp6p component of the nuclear exosome accumulate polyadenylated forms of many different ribosomal RNA precursors (pre-rRNAs). This polyadenylation is reduced in strains lacking either the poly(A) polymerase Trf4p or its close homologue Trf5p. In contrast, polyadenylation is enhanced by overexpression of Trf5p. Polyadenylation is also markedly increased in strains lacking the RNA helicase Mtr4p, indicating that it is required to couple poly(A) polymerase activity to degradation. Tandem affinity purification-tagged purified Trf5p showed polyadenylation activity in vitro, which was abolished by a double point mutation in the predicted catalytic site. Trf5p co-purified with Mtr4p and Air1p, indicating that it forms a complex, designated TRAMP5, that has functions that partially overlap with the TRAMP complex.

Inhibition of furin by polyarginine-containing peptides: nanomolar
inhibition by nona-D-arginine.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Polyarginine-containing peptides represent potent inhibitors of furin, a mammalian endoprotease that plays an important role in metabolism, activation of pathogenic toxins, and viral proliferation. The therapeutic use of D-polyarginines is especially interesting because they are not cleaved by furin and possess inhibitory potency almost equal to L-polyarginines. In this study we attempted to determine the important elements within polyarginines that contribute to effective inhibition. Structure-function analyses of polyarginine peptides showed that inhibition by polyarginine-containing peptides appeared to depend on the total number of basic charges of the positively charged inhibitors bound to the negatively charged substrate binding pocket; peptide positioning did not appear to be rigorously determined. Screening of L- and D-decapeptide positional scanning combinatorial peptide libraries indicated a preference for basic residues in nearly all positions, similar to previous results with hexapeptide libraries. Length and terminal modification studies showed that the most potent D-polyarginine tested was nona-D-arginine (D9R) amide with a K(i) of 1.3 nm. D9R amide was shown to protect RAW264.7 cells against anthrax toxemia with an IC(50) of 3.7 microm. Because of its high stability, specificity, low toxicity, small molecular weight, and extremely low K(i) against furin, D9R amide or its derivatives may represent promising compounds for therapeutic use.

<ABSTRACT>
Whereas eubacterial and eukaryotic riboflavin synthases form homotrimers, archaeal riboflavin synthases from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Methanothermobacter thermoautrophicus are homopentamers with sequence similarity to the 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase catalyzing the penultimate step in riboflavin biosynthesis. Recently it could be shown that the complex dismutation reaction catalyzed by the pentameric M. jannaschii riboflavin synthase generates riboflavin with the same regiochemistry as observed for trimeric riboflavin synthases. Here we present crystal structures of the pentameric riboflavin synthase from M. jannaschii and its complex with the substrate analog inhibitor, 6,7-dioxo-8-ribityllumazine. The complex structure shows five active sites located between adjacent monomers of the pentamer. Each active site can accommodate two substrate analog molecules in anti-parallel orientation. The topology of the two bound ligands at the active site is well in line with the known stereochemistry of a pentacyclic adduct of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine that has been shown to serve as a kinetically competent intermediate. The pentacyclic intermediates of trimeric and pentameric riboflavin synthases are diastereomers.

Targeting of Miz-1 is essential for Myc-mediated apoptosis.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The c-Myc oncoprotein plays a central role in human cancer via its ability to either activate or repress the transcription of essential downstream targets. For many of the repressed target genes, down-regulation by c-Myc relies on its ability to bind and inactivate the transcription factor Miz-1. Although Miz-1 inactivation is suspected to be essential for at least some of the biological activities of c-Myc, it has been difficult to demonstrate this requirement experimentally. Using a combination of short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown and a previously characterized mutant of c-Myc that is defective for Miz-1 inactivation, we examined whether this inactivation is critical for three of the most central biological functions of c-Myc, cell cycle progression, transformation, and apoptosis. The results of this analysis demonstrated that in the in vitro assays utilized here, Miz-1 inactivation is dispensable for c-Myc-induced cell cycle progression and transformation. In marked contrast, the ability of c-Myc to induce apoptosis in primary diploid human fibroblasts in response to growth factor withdrawal is entirely dependent on its ability to inactivate Miz-1. These data have a significant impact on our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms dictating how c-Myc mediates opposing biological functions, such as transformation and apoptosis, and demonstrate the first requirement for Miz-1 inactivation in any of the biological functions of c-Myc.

Structural basis for the inhibition of activin signalling by follistatin.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The secreted, multidomain protein follistatin binds activins with high affinity, inhibiting their receptor interaction. We have dissected follistatin's domain structure and shown that the minimal activin-inhibiting fragment of follistatin is comprised of the first and second Fs domains (Fs12). This protein can bind to activin dimer and form a stable complex containing two Fs12 molecules and one activin dimer. We have solved crystal structures of activin A alone and its complex with Fs12 fragment to 2 A resolution. The complex structure shows how Fs12 molecules wrap around the back of the 'wings' of activin, blocking the type II receptor-binding site on activin A. Arginine 192 in Fs2 is a key residue in this interaction, inserting itself in between activin's fingers. Complex formation imposes a novel orientation for the EGF- and Kazal-like subdomains in the Fs2 domain and activin A shows further variation from the canonical TGF-beta family fold. The structure provides a detailed description of the inhibitory mechanism and gives insights into interactions of follistatin with other TGF-beta family proteins.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Myogenin is required not for the initiation of myogenesis but instead for skeletal muscle formation through poorly understood mechanisms. We demonstrate in cultured cells and, for the first time, in embryonic tissue, that myogenic late genes that specify the skeletal muscle phenotype are bound by MyoD prior to the initiation of gene expression. At the onset of muscle specification, a transition from MyoD to myogenin occurred at late gene loci, concomitant with loss of HDAC2, the appearance of both the Mef2D regulator and the Brg1 chromatin-remodeling enzyme, and the opening of chromatin structure. We further demonstrated that ectopic expression of myogenin and Mef2D, in the absence of MyoD, was sufficient to induce muscle differentiation in a manner entirely dependent on Brg1. These results indicate that myogenin specifies the muscle phenotype by cooperating with Mef2D to recruit an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzyme that alters chromatin structure at regulatory sequences to promote terminal differentiation.

TMP21 is a presenilin complex component that modulates gamma-secretase but

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The presenilin proteins (PS1 and PS2) and their interacting partners nicastrin, aph-1 (refs 4, 5) and pen-2 (ref. 5) form a series of high-molecular-mass, membrane-bound protein complexes that are necessary for gamma-secretase and epsilon-secretase cleavage of selected type 1 transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein, Notch and cadherins. Modest cleavage activity can be generated by reconstituting these four proteins in yeast and Spodoptera frugiperda (sf9) cells. However, a critical but unanswered question about the biology of the presenilin complexes is how their activity is modulated in terms of substrate specificity and/or relative activities at the gamma and epsilon sites. A corollary to this question is whether additional proteins in the presenilin complexes might subsume these putative regulatory functions. The hypothesis that additional proteins might exist in the presenilin complexes is supported by the fact that enzymatically active complexes have a mass that is much greater than predicted for a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometric complex (at least 650 kDa observed, compared with about 220 kDa predicted). To address these questions we undertook a search for presenilin-interacting proteins that differentially affected gamma- and epsilon-site cleavage events. Here we report that TMP21, a member of the p24 cargo protein family, is a component of presenilin complexes and differentially regulates gamma-secretase cleavage without affecting epsilon-secretase activity.

Structural basis for reduced staphylocoagulase-mediated bovine prothrombin
activation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Staphylocoagulase (SC) is a protein secreted by the human pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, that activates human prothrombin (ProT) by inducing a conformational change. SC-bound ProT efficiently clots fibrinogen, thus bypassing the physiological blood coagulation pathway. The crystal structure of a fully active SC fragment, SC-(1-325), bound to human prethrombin 2 showed that the SC-(1-325) N terminus inserts into the Ile(16) pocket of prethrombin 2, thereby inducing expression of a functional catalytic site in the cognate zymogen without peptide bond cleavage. As shown here, SC-(1-325) binds to bovine and human ProT with similar affinity but activates the bovine zymogen only very poorly. By contrast to the approximately 2-fold difference in chromogenic substrate kinetic constants between human thrombin and the SC-(1-325).human (pro)thrombin complexes, SC-(1-325).bovine ProT shows a 3,500-fold lower k(cat)/K(m) compared with free bovine thrombin, because of a 47-fold increase in K(m) and a 67-fold decrease in k(cat). The SC-(1-325).bovine ProT complex is approximately 5,800-fold less active compared with its human counterpart. Comparison of human and bovine fibrinogen as substrates of human and bovine thrombin and the SC-(1-325).(pro)thrombin complexes indicates that the species specificity of SC-(1-325) cofactor activity is determined primarily by differences in conformational activation of bound ProT. These results suggest that the catalytic site in the SC-(1-325).bovine ProT complex is incompletely formed. The current crystal structure of SC-(1-325).bovine thrombin reveals that SC would dock similarly to the bovine proenzyme, whereas the bovine (pro)thrombin-characteristic residues Arg(144) and Arg(145) would likely interfere with insertion of the SC N terminus, thus explaining the greatly reduced activation of bovine ProT.

Rapid accessibility of nucleosomal DNA in yeast on a second time scale.

<ABSTRACT>
Packaging DNA in nucleosomes and higher-order chromatin structures restricts its accessibility and constitutes a barrier for all DNA transactions including gene regulation and DNA repair. How and how fast proteins find access to DNA buried in chromatin of living cells is poorly understood. To address this question in a real time in vivo approach, we investigated DNA repair by photolyase in yeast. We show that overexpressed photolyase, a light-dependent DNA-repair enzyme, recognizes and repairs UV-damaged DNA within seconds. Rapid repair was observed in various nucleosomal regions of the genome including inactive and active genes and repressed promoters. About 50% of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers were removed in 5 s, >80% in 90 s. Heterochromatin was repaired within minutes, centromeres were not repaired. Consistent with fast conformational transitions of nucleosomes observed in vitro, this rapid repair strongly suggests that spontaneous unwrapping of nucleosomes rather than histone dissociation or chromatin remodeling provides DNA access. The data impact our view on the repressive and dynamic nature of chromatin and illustrate how proteins like photolyase can access DNA in structurally and functionally diverse chromatin regions.

<ABSTRACT>
The insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2) branch of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-signaling cascade prevents diabetes in mice because it promotes beta cell replication, function, and survival, especially during metabolic stress. Because exendin-4 (Ex4), a long acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, has similar effects upon beta cells in rodents and humans, we investigated whether Irs2 signaling was required for Ex4 action in isolated beta cells and in Irs2(-/-) mice. Ex4 increased cAMP levels in human islets and Min6 cells, which promoted Irs2 expression and stimulated Akt phosphorylation. In wild type mice Ex4 administered continuously for 28 days increased beta cell mass 2-fold. By contrast, Ex4 failed to arrest the progressive beta cell loss in Irs2(-/-) mice, which culminated in fatal diabetes; however, Ex4 delayed the progression of diabetes by 3 weeks by promoting insulin secretion from the remaining islets. We conclude that some short term therapeutic effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists can be independent of Irs2, but its long term effects upon beta cell growth and survival are mediated by the Irs2 branch of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling cascade.

The Hrd1p ligase complex forms a linchpin between ER-lumenal substrate
selection and Cdc48p recruitment.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Misfolded proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are targeted to the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation. Key components of this process are ER membrane-bound ubiquitin ligases. These ligases associate with the cytoplasmic AAA-ATPase Cdc48p/p97, which is thought to support the release of malfolded proteins from the ER. Here, we characterize a yeast protein complex containing the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1p and the ER membrane proteins Hrd3p and Der1p. Hrd3p binds malfolded proteins in the ER lumen enabling their delivery to downstream components. Therefore, we propose that Hrd3p acts as a substrate recruitment factor for the Hrd1p ligase complex. Hrd3p function is also required for the association of Cdc48p with Hrd1p. Moreover, our data demonstrate that recruitment of Cdc48p depends on substrate processing by the Hrd1p ligase complex. Thus, the Hrd1p ligase complex unites substrate selection in the ER lumen and polyubiquitination in the cytoplasm and links these processes to the release of ER proteins via the Cdc48p complex.

An hGCN5/TRRAP histone acetyltransferase complex co-activates BRCA1
transactivation function through histone modification.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
It is well established that genetic mutations that impair BRCA1 function predispose women to early onset of breast and ovarian cancer. However, the co-regulatory factors that support normal BRCA1 functions remain to be identified. Using a biochemical approach to search for such co-regulatory factors, we identified hGCN5, TRRAP, and hMSH2/6 as BRCA1-interacting proteins. Genetic mutations in the C-terminal transactivation domain of BRCA1, as found in breast cancer patients (Chapman, M. S., and Verma, I. M. (1996) Nature 382, 678-679), caused the loss of physical interaction between BRCA1 and TRRAP and significantly reduced the co-activation of BRCA1 transactivation function by hGCN5/TRRAP. The reported transcriptional squelching between BRCA1 and estrogen receptor alpha (Fan, S., Wang, J., Yuan, R., Ma, Y., Meng, Q., Erdos, M. R., Pestell, R. G., Yuan, F., Auborn, K. J., Goldberg, I. D., and Rosen, E. M. (1999) Science 284, 1354-1356) was rescued by the overexpression of TRRAP or hGCN5. Histone acetyltransferase hGCN5 activity appeared to be indispensable for coregulator complex function in both BRCA1-mediated gene regulation and DNA repair. Biochemical purification of the hGCN5/TRRAP-containing complex suggested that hGCN5/TRRAP formed a complex with hMSH2/hMSH6, presumably as a novel subclass of hGCN5/TRRAP-containing known TFTC (TBP-free TAF-containing)-type histone acetyltransferase complex (hTFTC, hPCAF, and hSTAGA) (Yanagisawa, J., Kitagawa, H., Yanagida, M., Wada, O., Ogawa, S., Nakagomi, M., Oishi, H., Yamamoto, Y., Nagasawa, H., McMahon, S. B., Cole, M. D., Tora, L., Takahashi, N., and Kato, S. (2002) Mol. Cell 9, 553-562). Unlike other subclasses, the isolated complex harbored a previously unknown combination of components including hMSH2 and hMSH6, major components of the BRCA1 genome surveillance repair complex (BASC). Thus, our results suggested that the multiple BRCA1 functions require a novel hGCN5/TRRAP histone acetyltransferase complex subclass.

Trans-activation of the DNA-damage signalling protein kinase Chk2 by
T-loop exchange.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The protein kinase Chk2 (checkpoint kinase 2) is a major effector of the replication checkpoint. Chk2 activation is initiated by phosphorylation of Thr68, in the serine-glutamine/threonine-glutamine cluster domain (SCD), by ATM. The phosphorylated SCD-segment binds to the FHA domain of a second Chk2 molecule, promoting dimerisation of the protein and triggering phosphorylation of the activation segment/T-loop in the kinase domain. We have now determined the structure of the kinase domain of human Chk2 in complexes with ADP and a small-molecule inhibitor debromohymenialdisine. The structure reveals a remarkable dimeric arrangement in which T-loops are exchanged between protomers, to form an active kinase conformation in trans. Biochemical data suggest that this dimer is the biologically active state promoted by ATM-phosphorylation, and also suggests a mechanism for dimerisation-driven activation of Chk2 by trans-phosphorylation.

<ABSTRACT>
Previously, we showed that mutants of Thermus thermophilus 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMDH) each containing a residue (ancestral residue) that had been predicted to exist in a postulated common ancestor protein often have greater thermal stabilities than does the contemporary wild-type enzyme. In this study, the combined effects of multiple ancestral residues were analyzed. Two mutants, containing multiple mutations, Sup3mut (Val181Thr/Pro324Thr/Ala335Glu) and Sup4mut (Leu134Asn/Val181Thr/Pro324Thr/Ala335Glu) were constructed and show greater thermal stabilities than the wild-type and single-point mutant IPMDHs do. Most of the mutants have similar or improved catalytic efficiencies at 70 degrees C when compared with the wild-type IPMDH.

The effects of mitochondrial iron homeostasis on cofactor specificity of
superoxide dismutase 2.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Many metalloproteins have the capacity to bind diverse metals, but in living cells connect only with their cognate metal cofactor. In eukaryotes, this metal specificity can be achieved through metal-specific metallochaperone proteins. Herein, we describe a mechanism whereby Saccharomyces cerevisiae manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) preferentially binds manganese over iron based on the differential bioavailability of these ions within mitochondria. The bulk of mitochondrial iron is normally unavailable to SOD2, but when mitochondrial iron homeostasis is disrupted, for example, by mutations in S. cerevisiae mtm1, ssq1 and grx5, iron accumulates in a reactive form that potently competes with manganese for binding to SOD2, inactivating the enzyme. Studies in mtm1 mutants indicate that iron inactivation of SOD2 involves the Mrs3p/Mrs4p mitochondrial carriers and iron-binding frataxin (Yfh1p). A small pool of SOD2-reactive iron also exists under normal iron homeostasis conditions and binds SOD2 when mitochondrial manganese is low. The ability to control this reactive pool of iron is critical to maintaining SOD2 activity and has important potential implications for oxidative stress in disorders of iron overload.

<ABSTRACT>
Type IIB receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are bi-functional cell surface molecules. Their ectodomains mediate stable, homophilic, cell-adhesive interactions, whereas the intracellular catalytic regions can modulate the phosphorylation state of cadherin/catenin complexes. We describe a systematic investigation of the cell-adhesive properties of the extracellular region of RPTPmu, a prototypical type IIB RPTP. The crystal structure of a construct comprising its N-terminal MAM (meprin/A5/mu) and Ig domains was determined at 2.7 A resolution; this assigns the MAM fold to the jelly-roll family and reveals extensive interactions between the two domains, which form a rigid structural unit. Structure-based site-directed mutagenesis, serial domain deletions and cell-adhesion assays allowed us to identify the four N-terminal domains (MAM, Ig, fibronectin type III (FNIII)-1 and FNIII-2) as a minimal functional unit. Biophysical characterization revealed at least two independent types of homophilic interaction which, taken together, suggest that there is the potential for formation of a complex and possibly ordered array of receptor molecules at cell contact sites.

<ABSTRACT>
Microtubule plus-end proteins CLIP-170 and EB1 dynamically track the tips of growing microtubules in vivo. Here we examine the association of these proteins with microtubules in vitro. CLIP-170 binds tubulin dimers and co-assembles into growing microtubules. EB1 binds tubulin dimers more weakly, so no co-assembly is observed. However, EB1 binds to CLIP-170, and forms a co-complex with CLIP-170 and tubulin that is recruited to growing microtubule plus ends. The interaction between CLIP-170 and EB1 is competitively inhibited by the related CAP-Gly protein p150Glued, which also localizes to microtubule plus ends in vivo. Based on these observations, we propose a model in which the formation of distinct plus-end complexes may differentially affect microtubule dynamics in vivo.

<ABSTRACT>
Selenium has significant health benefits, including potent cancer prevention activity and roles in immune function and the male reproductive system. Selenium-containing proteins, which incorporate this essential micronutrient as selenocysteine, are proposed to mediate the positive effects of dietary selenium. Presented here are the solution NMR structures of the selenoprotein SelM and an ortholog of the selenoprotein Sep15. These data reveal that Sep15 and SelM are structural homologs that establish a new thioredoxin-like protein family. The location of the active-site redox motifs within the fold together with the observed localized conformational changes after thiol-disulfide exchange and measured redox potential indicate that they have redox activity. In mammals, Sep15 expression is regulated by dietary selenium, and either decreased or increased expression of this selenoprotein alters redox homeostasis. A physiological role for Sep15 and SelM as thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases and their contribution to the quality control pathways of the endoplasmic reticulum are discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
Frame shift mutations of the polyglutamine binding protein-1 (PQBP1) gene lead to total or partial truncation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) and cause mental retardation in human patients. Interestingly, normal Drosophila homologue of PQBP-1 lacks CTD. As a model to analyze the molecular network of PQBP-1 affecting intelligence, we generated transgenic flies expressing human PQBP-1 with CTD. Pavlovian olfactory conditioning revealed that the transgenic flies showed disturbance of long-term memory. In addition, they showed abnormal courtship that male flies follow male flies. Abnormal functions of PQBP-1 or its binding partner might be linked to these symptoms.

<ABSTRACT>
The dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase MKP-1/CL100/DUSP1 is an inducible nuclear protein controlled by p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) in a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit kinase activity. Here, we report on the molecular basis for a novel positive feedback mechanism to sustain ERK activation by triggering MKP-1 proteolysis. Active ERK2 docking to the DEF motif (FXFP, residues 339-342) of N-terminally truncated MKP-1 in vitro initiated phosphorylation at the Ser(296)/Ser(323) domain, which was not affected by substituting Ala for Ser at Ser(359)/Ser(364). The DEF and Ser(296)/Ser(323) sites were essential for ubiquitin-mediated MKP-1 proteolysis stimulated by MKK1-ERK signaling in H293 cells, whereas the N-terminal domain and Ser(359)/Ser(364) sites were dispensable. ERK activation by serum increased the endogenous level of ubiquitinated phospho-Ser(296) MKP-1 and the degradation of MKP-1. Intriguingly, active ERK-promoted phospho-Ser(296) MKP-1 bound to SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase in vivo and in vitro. Forced expression of Skp2 enhanced MKP-1 polyubiquitination and proteolysis upon ERK activation, whereas depletion of endogenous Skp2 suppressed such events. The kinetics of ERK signaling stimulated by serum correlated with the endogenous MKP-1 degradation rate in a Skp2-dependent manner. Thus, MKP-1 proteolysis can be achieved via ERK and SCF(Skp2) cooperation, thereby sustaining ERK activation.

<ABSTRACT>
Muscular dystrophies include a diverse group of genetically heterogeneous disorders that together affect 1 in 2000 births worldwide. The diseases are characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting that lead to severe disability and often premature death. Rostrocaudal muscular dystrophy (rmd) is a new recessive mouse mutation that causes a rapidly progressive muscular dystrophy and a neonatal forelimb bone deformity. The rmd mutation is a 1.6-kb intragenic deletion within the choline kinase beta (Chkb) gene, resulting in a complete loss of CHKB protein and enzymatic activity. CHKB is one of two mammalian choline kinase (CHK) enzymes (alpha and beta) that catalyze the phosphorylation of choline to phosphocholine in the biosynthesis of the major membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine. While mutant rmd mice show a dramatic decrease of CHK activity in all tissues, the dystrophy is only evident in skeletal muscle tissues in an unusual rostral-to-caudal gradient. Minor membrane disruption similar to dysferlinopathies suggest that membrane fusion defects may underlie this dystrophy, because severe membrane disruptions are not evident as determined by creatine kinase levels, Evans Blue infiltration, and unaltered levels of proteins in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. The rmd mutant mouse offers the first demonstration of a defect in a phospholipid biosynthetic enzyme causing muscular dystrophy, representing a unique model for understanding mechanisms of muscle degeneration.

<ABSTRACT>
Thrombin generation and fibrinogen (Fbg) clotting are the ultimate proteolytic reactions in the blood coagulation pathway. Staphylocoagulase (SC), a protein secreted by the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, activates prothrombin (ProT) without proteolysis. The SC.(pro)thrombin complex recognizes Fbg as a specific substrate, converting it directly into fibrin. The crystal structure of a fully active SC fragment containing residues 1-325 (SC-(1-325)) bound to human prethrombin 2 showed previously that SC inserts its Ile(1)-Val(2) N terminus into the Ile(16) pocket of prethrombin 2, inducing a functional active site in the cognate zymogen conformationally. Exosite I of alpha-thrombin, the Fbg recognition site, and proexosite I on ProT are blocked by domain 2 of SC-(1-325). In the present studies, active site-labeled fluorescent ProT analogs were used to quantitate Fbg binding to the SC-(1-325).ProT complex. Fbg binding and cleavage are mediated by expression of a new Fbg-binding exosite on the SC-(1-325).ProT complex, resulting in formation of an (SC-(1-325).ProT)(2).Fbg pentameric complex with a dissociation constant of 8-34 nm. In both crystal structures, the SC-(1-325).(pre)thrombin complexes form dimers, with both proteinases/zymogens facing each other over a large U-shaped cleft, through which the Fbg substrate could thread. On this basis, a molecular model of the pentameric (SC-(1-325).thrombin)(2).Fbg encounter complex was generated, which explains the coagulant properties and efficient Fbg conversion. The results provide new insight into the mechanism that mediates high affinity Fbg binding and cleavage as a substrate of SC.(pro)thrombin complexes, a process that is central to the molecular pathology of S. aureus endocarditis.

Cation-coupled active transport is an essential cellular process found ubiquitously in all living organisms. Here, we present two novel ligand-free X-ray structures of the lactose permease (LacY) of Escherichia coli determined at acidic and neutral pH, and propose a model for the mechanism of coupling between lactose and H+ translocation. No sugar-binding site is observed in the absence of ligand, and deprotonation of the key residue Glu269 is associated with ligand binding. Thus, substrate induces formation of the sugar-binding site, as well as the initial step in H+ transduction.

Interleukin-8 secretion by fibroblasts induced by low density lipoproteins

<ABSTRACT>
We have previously reported (Dobreva, I., Waeber, G., Mooser, V., James, R. W., and Widmann, C. (2003) J. Lipid Res. 44, 2382-2390) that low density lipoproteins (LDLs) induce activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, resulting in fibroblast spreading and lamellipodia formation. Here, we show that LDL-stimulated fibroblast spreading and wound sealing are due to secretion of a soluble factor. Using an antibody-based human protein array, interleukin-8 (IL-8) was identified as the main cytokine whose concentration was increased in supernatants from LDL-stimulated cells. Incubation of supernatants from LDL-treated cells with an anti-IL-8 blocking antibody completely abolished their ability to induce cell spreading and mediate wound closure. In addition, fibroblasts treated with recombinant IL-8 spread to the same extent as cells incubated with LDL or supernatants from LDL-treated cells. The ability of LDL and IL-8 to induce fibroblast spreading was mediated by the IL-8 receptor type II (CXCR-2). Furthermore, LDL-induced IL-8 production and subsequent wound closure required the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, because both processes were abrogated by a specific p38 inhibitor. Therefore, the capacity of LDLs to induce fibroblast spreading and accelerate wound closure relies on their ability to stimulate IL-8 secretion in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. Regulation of fibroblast shape and migration by lipoproteins may be relevant to atherosclerosis that is characterized by increased LDL cholesterol levels, IL-8 production, and extensive remodeling of the vessel wall.

Phosphorylation of HSF1 by MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 on serine 121,
inhibits transcriptional activity and promotes HSP90 binding.

<ABSTRACT>
Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) monitors the structural integrity of intracellular proteins and its regulation is essential for the health and longevity of eukaryotic organisms. HSF1 also plays a role in the acute inflammatory response in the negative regulation of cytokine gene transcription. Here we show, for the first time, that HSF1 is regulated by the proinflammatory protein kinase MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2). We have shown that MK2 directly phosphorylates HSF1 and inhibits activity by decreasing its ability to bind the heat shock elements (HSE) found in the promoters of target genes encoding the HSP molecular chaperones and cytokine genes. We show that activation of HSF1 to bind HSE in hsp promoters is inhibited through the phosphorylation of a specific residue, serine 121 by MK2. A potential mechanism for MK2-induced HSF1 inactivation is suggested by the findings that phosphorylation of serine 121 enhances HSF1 binding to HSP90, a major repressor of HSF1. Dephosphorylation of serine 121 in cells exposed to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs leads to HSP90 dissociation from HSF1, which then forms active DNA binding trimers. These experiments indicate a novel mechanism for the regulation of HSF1 by proinflammatory signaling and may permit HSF1 to respond rapidly to extracellular events, permitting optimal physiological regulation.

<ABSTRACT>
It has been shown that oxidative stress and activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway induce the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of the pancreatic transcription factor PDX-1, which leads to pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. In this study, we have shown that the forkhead transcription factor Foxo1/FKHR plays a role as a mediator between the JNK pathway and PDX-1. Under oxidative stress conditions, Foxo1 changed its intracellular localization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in the pancreatic beta-cell line HIT-T15. The overexpression of JNK also induced the nuclear localization of Foxo1, but in contrast, suppression of JNK reduced the oxidative stress-induced nuclear localization of Foxo1, suggesting the involvement of the JNK pathway in Foxo1 translocation. In addition, oxidative stress or activation of the JNK pathway decreased the activity of Akt in HIT cells, leading to the decreased phosphorylation of Foxo1 following nuclear localization. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated Foxo1 overexpression reduced the nuclear expression of PDX-1, whereas repression of Foxo1 by Foxo1-specific small interfering RNA retained the nuclear expression of PDX-1 under oxidative stress conditions. Taken together, Foxo1 is involved in the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of PDX-1 by oxidative stress and the JNK pathway.

Gene expression during acute and prolonged hypoxia is regulated by
distinct mechanisms of translational control.

<ABSTRACT>
Hypoxia has recently been shown to activate the endoplasmic reticulum kinase PERK, leading to phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and inhibition of mRNA translation initiation. Using a quantitative assay, we show that this inhibition exhibits a biphasic response mediated through two distinct pathways. The first occurs rapidly, reaching a maximum at 1-2 h and is due to phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Continued hypoxic exposure activates a second, eIF2alpha-independent pathway that maintains repression of translation. This phase is characterized by disruption of eIF4F and sequestration of eIF4E by its inhibitor 4E-BP1 and transporter 4E-T. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of polysomal RNA indicates that the translation efficiency of individual genes varies widely during hypoxia. Furthermore, the translation efficiency of individual genes is dynamic, changing dramatically during hypoxic exposure due to the initial phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Together, our data indicate that acute and prolonged hypoxia regulates mRNA translation through distinct mechanisms, each with important contributions to hypoxic gene expression.

Cadherin regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
Synaptic remodeling has been postulated as a mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity, and cadherin adhesion molecules are thought to be a regulator of such a process. We examined the effects of cadherin blockage on synaptogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons. This blockade resulted in alterations of dendritic spine morphology, such as filopodia-like elongation of the spine and bifurcation of its head structure, along with concomitant disruption of the distribution of postsynaptic proteins. The accumulation of synapsin at presynaptic sites and synaptic vesicle recycling were also perturbed, although these synaptic responses to the cadherin blockade became less evident upon the maturation of the synapses. These findings suggest that cadherin regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis and related synaptic functions, presumably cooperating with cadherin-independent adhesive mechanisms to maintain spine-axon contacts.

<ABSTRACT>
Chloroplasts of higher plants contain a unique signal recognition particle (cpSRP) that consists of two proteins, cpSRP54 and cpSRP43. CpSRP43 is composed of a four ankyrin repeat domain and three functionally distinct chromodomains (CDs). In this report we confirm previously published data that the second chromodomain (CD2) provides the primary binding site for cpSRP54. However, quantitative binding analysis demonstrates that cpSRP54 binds to CD2 significantly less efficiently than it binds to full-length cpSRP43. Further analysis of the binding interface of cpSRP by mutagenesis studies and a pepscan approach demonstrates that the C-terminal alpha-helix of CD2 facilitates binding to cpSRP54.

function through heterodimerization.

<ABSTRACT>
One-third of the approximately 400 nonodorant G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are still orphans. Although a considerable number of these receptors are likely to transduce cellular signals in response to ligands that remain to be identified, they may also have ligand-independent functions. Several members of the GPCR family have been shown to modulate the function of other receptors through heterodimerization. We show that GPR50, an orphan GPCR, heterodimerizes constitutively and specifically with MT(1) and MT(2) melatonin receptors, using biochemical and biophysical approaches in intact cells. Whereas the association between GPR50 and MT(2) did not modify MT(2) function, GPR50 abolished high-affinity agonist binding and G protein coupling to the MT(1) protomer engaged in the heterodimer. Deletion of the large C-terminal tail of GPR50 suppressed the inhibitory effect of GPR50 on MT(1) without affecting heterodimerization, indicating that this domain regulates the interaction of regulatory proteins to MT(1). Pairing orphan GPCRs to potential heterodimerization partners might be of clinical importance and may become a general strategy to better understand the function of orphan GPCRs.

Active metabolite of atorvastatin inhibits membrane cholesterol domain
formation by an antioxidant mechanism.

<ABSTRACT>
The advanced atherosclerotic lesion is characterized by the formation of microscopic cholesterol crystals that contribute to mechanisms of inflammation and apoptotic cell death. These crystals develop from membrane cholesterol domains, a process that is accelerated under conditions of hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress. In this study, the comparative effects of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) on oxidative stress-induced cholesterol domain formation were tested in model membranes containing physiologic levels of cholesterol using small angle x-ray diffraction approaches. In the absence of HMG-CoA reductase, only the atorvastatin active o-hydroxy metabolite (ATM) blocked membrane cholesterol domain formation as a function of oxidative stress. This effect of ATM is attributed to electron donation and proton stabilization mechanisms associated with its phenoxy group located in the membrane hydrocarbon core. ATM inhibited lipid peroxidation in human low density lipoprotein and phospholipid vesicles in a dose-dependent manner, unlike its parent and other statins (pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin). These findings indicate an atheroprotective effect of ATM on membrane lipid organization through a potent antioxidant mechanism.

Core fucosylation regulates epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated
intracellular signaling.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
alpha1,6-Fucosyltransferase (Fut8) catalyzes the transfer of a fucose residue to N-linked oligosaccharides on glycoproteins via an alpha1,6-linkage to form core fucosylation in mammals. We recently found that disruption of the Fut8 gene induces severe growth retardation and early postnatal death. To investigate the molecular mechanism involved, we have established embryonic fibroblasts of Fut8+/+ and Fut8-/-, derived from wild-type and Fut8-null mice, respectively. Interestingly, the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced phosphorylation levels of the EGF receptor (EGFR) were substantially blocked in Fut8-/- cells, compared with Fut8+/+ cells, while there are no significant changes in the total activities of tyrosine phosphatase for phosphorylated EGFR between two cells. The inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation was completely restored by re-introduction of the Fut8 gene to Fut8-/- cells. Consistent with this, EGFR-mediated JNK or ERK activation was significantly suppressed in Fut8-/- cells. Finally, we found that the core fucosylation of N-glycans is required for the binding of the EGF to its receptor, whereas no effect was observed for the expression levels of EGFR on the cell surface. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that core fucosylation is essential for EGF receptor-mediated biological functions.

Outer chain N-glycans are required for cell wall integrity and virulence
of Candida albicans.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The outer layer of the Candida albicans cell wall is enriched in highly glycosylated mannoproteins that are the immediate point of contact with the host and strongly influence the host-fungal interaction. N-Glycans are the major form of mannoprotein modification and consist of a core structure, common to all eukaryotes, that is further elaborated in the Golgi to form the highly branched outer chain that is characteristic of fungi. In yeasts, outer chain branching is initiated by the action of the alpha1,6-mannosyltransferase Och1p; therefore, we disrupted the C. albicans OCH1 homolog to determine the importance of outer chain N-glycans on the host-fungal interaction. Loss of CaOCH1 resulted in a temperature-sensitive growth defect and cellular aggregation. Outer chain elongation of N-glycans was absent in the null mutant, demonstrated by the lack of the alpha1,6-linked polymannose backbone and the underglycosylation of N-acetylglucosaminidase. A null mutant lacking OCH1 was hypersensitive to a range of cell wall perturbing agents and had a constitutively activated cell wall integrity pathway. These mutants had near normal growth rates in vitro but were attenuated in virulence in a murine model of systemic infection. However, tissue burdens for the Caoch1delta null mutant were similar to control strains with normal N-glycosylation, suggesting the host-fungal interaction was altered such that high burdens were tolerated. This demonstrates the importance of N-glycan outer chain epitopes to the host-fungal interaction and virulence.

<ABSTRACT>
During DNA replication one or both strands transiently become single stranded: first at the sites where initiation of DNA synthesis occurs (known as origins of replication) and subsequently on the lagging strands of replication forks as discontinuous Okazaki fragments are generated. We report a genome-wide analysis of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) formation in the presence of hydroxyurea during DNA replication in wild-type and checkpoint-deficient rad53 Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. In wild-type cells, ssDNA was first observed at a subset of replication origins and later 'migrated' bi-directionally, suggesting that ssDNA formation is associated with continuously moving replication forks. In rad53 cells, ssDNA was observed at virtually every known origin, but remained there over time, suggesting that replication forks stall. Telomeric regions seemed to be particularly sensitive to the loss of Rad53 checkpoint function. Replication origins in Schizosaccharomyces pombe were also mapped using our method.

Endophilin BAR domain drives membrane curvature by two newly identified
structure-based mechanisms.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The crescent-shaped BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs-homology) domain dimer is a versatile protein module that senses and generates positive membrane curvature. The BAR domain dimer of human endophilin-A1, solved at 3.1 A, has a unique structure consisting of a pair of helix-loop appendages sprouting out from the crescent. The appendage's short helices form a hydrophobic ridge, which runs across the concave surface at its center. Examining liposome binding and tubulation in vitro using purified BAR domain and its mutants indicated that the ridge penetrates into the membrane bilayer and enhances liposome tubulation. BAR domain-expressing cells exhibited marked plasma membrane tubulation in vivo. Furthermore, a swinging-arm mutant lost liposome tubulation activity yet retaining liposome binding. These data suggested that the rigid crescent dimer shape is crucial for the tubulation. We here propose that the BAR domain drives membrane curvature by coordinate action of the crescent's scaffold mechanism and the ridge's membrane insertion in addition to membrane binding via amino-terminal amphipathic helix.

Regulation of nuclear translocation of HDAC3 by IkappaBalpha is required

receptor gamma function.

<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) function by TNF-alpha contributes to glucose and fatty acid metabolic disorders in inflammation and cancer, although the molecular mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that nuclear translocation of HDAC3 is regulated by TNF-alpha, and this event is required for inhibition of transcriptional activity of PPARgamma by TNF-alpha. HDAC3 is associated with IkappaBalpha in the cytoplasm. After IkappaBalpha degradation in response to TNF-alpha, HDAC3 is subject to nuclear translocation, leading to an increase in HDAC3 activity in the nucleus. This event leads to subcellular redistribution of HDAC3. Knock-out of IkappaBalpha, but not p65 or p50, leads to disappearance of HDAC3 in the cytoplasm, which is associated with HDAC3 enrichment in the nucleus. These data suggest that inhibition of PPARgamma by TNF-alpha is not associated with a reduction in the DNA binding activity of PPARgamma. Rather, these results suggest that IkappaBalpha-dependent nuclear translocation of HDAC3 is responsible for PPARgamma inhibition by TNF-alpha.

Oncogenic function for the Dlg1 mammalian homolog of the Drosophila

<ABSTRACT>
The fact that several different human virus oncoproteins, including adenovirus type 9 E4-ORF1, evolved to target the Dlg1 mammalian homolog of the membrane-associated Drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor has implicated this cellular factor in human cancer. Despite a general belief that such interactions function solely to inactivate this suspected human tumor suppressor protein, we demonstrate here that E4-ORF1 specifically requires endogenous Dlg1 to provoke oncogenic activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in cells. Based on our results, we propose a model wherein E4-ORF1 binding to Dlg1 triggers the resulting complex to translocate to the plasma membrane and, at this site, to promote Ras-mediated PI3K activation. These findings establish the first known function for Dlg1 in virus-mediated cellular transformation and also surprisingly expose a previously unrecognized oncogenic activity encoded by this suspected cellular tumor suppressor gene.

<ABSTRACT>
This study attempted to define further the neural processing events underlying social anxiety in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and their response to pharmacotherapy. Social anxiety-related changes in regional cerebral blood flow were defined by [(15)O]H(2) positron emission tomography (PET) in medication-free individuals with generalized SAD (gSAD), and age- and sex-matched comparison subjects, and analyzed using a linear mixed effects model. PET studies were again acquired in the gSAD individuals following an 8-week, flexible dose treatment trial of nefazodone. Both script-guided mental imagery of an anxiogenic social situation and a confrontational mental arithmetic task were associated with marked increases in self-rated anxiety in both subject groups. For gSAD subjects, social anxiety induced by guided mental imagery was associated with increased activity in the left postcentral gyrus and lenticulate, and the right inferior frontal and middle temporal gyri. Social anxiety induced by the mental arithmetic task was associated with activation of the medial and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, insula, and ventral striatum. Both tasks were associated with relative decreases in activity in the right amygdala and the hippocampus. A direct group comparison indicated that comparison subjects exhibited a differing pattern of social anxiety-related neural activations. Nefazodone treatment was associated with marked clinical improvement. Comparison of social anxiety-related neural activations prior to and after nefazodone administration indicated greater activity in the precentral gyrus, insula, midbrain/hypothalamus, and middle frontal and anterior cingulate gyrus prior to treatment, and greater activity in the left middle occipital and bilateral lingual gyri, postcentral gyrus, gyrus rectus, and hippocampus after treatment. The results of an analysis relating neural activity and treatment-related changes in symptom severity indicated differential neural responses associated with states of symptom remission vs partial response. The observed social anxiety-related changes in distributed neural activity are consistent with cognitive models of SAD and adaptive decreases in amygdala activity in response to social anxiogenics, and support the association of altered frontal cortical responses with treatment response.Neuropsychopharmacology (2006) 31, 2243-2253. doi:10.1038/sj.npp.1301053; published online 8 March 2006.

Human Ccr4-Not complex is a ligand-dependent repressor of nuclear

<ABSTRACT>
The Ccr4-Not complex is a highly conserved regulator of mRNA metabolism. The transcription regulatory function of this complex in higher eukaryotes, however, is largely unexplored. Here we report that CNOT1, the large human subunit, represses the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function of oestrogen receptor (ER) alpha. Promoter recruitment assays indicate that CNOT1 contains an intrinsic ability to mediate transcriptional repression. Furthermore, CNOT1 can interact with the ligand-binding domain of ERalpha in a hormone-dependent fashion and is recruited with other Ccr4-Not subunits to endogenous oestrogen-regulated promoters dependent on the presence of ligand. In addition, siRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous CNOT1 or other Ccr4-Not subunits in breast cancer cells results in deregulation of ERalpha target genes. Finally, CNOT1 interacts in a ligand-dependent manner with RXR and represses transcription mediated by several RXR heterodimers. These findings define a function for the human Ccr4-Not complex as a transcriptional repressor of nuclear receptor signalling that is relevant for the understanding of molecular pathways involved in cancer.

Phospholipase Cgamma/diacylglycerol-dependent activation of

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Although receptor-mediated regulation of small G-proteins and the cytoskeleton is intensively studied, the mechanisms for attenuation of these signals are poorly understood. In this study, we have identified the Rac-GAP beta2-chimaerin as an effector of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via coupling to phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) and generation of the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG). EGF redistributes beta2-chimaerin to promote its association with the small GTPase Rac1 at the plasma membrane, as determined by FRET. This relocalization and association with Rac1 were impaired by disruption of the beta2-chimaerin C1 domain as well as by PLCgamma1 RNAi, thus defining beta2-chimaerin as a novel DAG effector. On the other hand, GAP-deficient beta2-chimaerin mutants show enhanced translocation and sustained Rac1 association in the FRET assays. Remarkably, RNAi depletion of beta2-chimaerin significantly extended the duration of Rac activation by EGF, suggesting that beta2-chimaerin serves as a mechanism that self-limits Rac activity in response to EGFR activation. Our results represent the first direct evidence of divergence in DAG signaling downstream of a tyrosine-kinase receptor via a PKC-independent mechanism.

Proteasomal degradation of the multifunctional regulator YB-1 is mediated

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
F-Box proteins (FBPs) are variable adaptor proteins that earmark protein substrates for ubiquination and destruction by the proteasome. Through their N-terminal F-box motif, they couple specific protein substrates to a catalytic machinery known as SCF (Skp-1/Cul1/F-Box) E3-ubiquitin ligase. Typical FBPs bind the specific substrates in a phosphorylation dependent manner via their C-termini using either leucine rich repeats (LRR) or tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD40) domains for substrate recognition. By using a gene trap strategy that selects for genes induced during programmed cell death, we have isolated the mouse homolog of the hypothetical human F-Box protein 33 (FBX33). Here we identify FBX33 as a component of an SCF E3-ubiquitin ligase that targets the multifunctional regulator Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1)/dbpB/p50 for polyubiquitination and destruction by the proteasome. By targeting YB-1 for proteasomal degradation, FBX33 negatively interferes with YB-1 mediated functions. In contrast to typical FBPs, FBX33 has no C-terminal LRR or WD40 domains and associates with YB-1 via its N-terminus. The present study confirms the existence of a formerly hypothetical F-Box protein in living cells and describes one of its substrates.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Gre factors enhance the intrinsic endonucleolytic activity of RNA polymerase to rescue arrested transcription complexes and are thought to confer the high fidelity and processivity of RNA synthesis. The Gre factors insert the extended alpha-helical coiled-coil domains into the RNA polymerase secondary channel to position two invariant acidic residues at the coiled-coil tip near the active site to stabilize the catalytic metal ion. Gfh1, a GreA homolog from Thermus thermophilus, inhibits rather than activates RNA cleavage. Here we report the structure of the T. thermophilus Gfh1 at 2.4 A resolution revealing a two-domain architecture closely resembling that of GreA. However, the interdomain orientation is strikingly distinct (approximately 162 degrees rotation) between the two proteins. In contrast to GreA, which has two acidic residues on a well fixed self-stabilized alpha-turn, the tip of the Gfh1 coiled-coil is flexible and contains four acidic residues. This difference is likely the key to the Gre functional diversity, while Gfh1 inhibits exo- and endonucleolytic cleavage, RNA synthesis, and pyrophosphorolysis, GreA enhances only the endonucleolytic cleavage. We propose that Gfh1 acidic residues stabilize the RNA polymerase active center in a catalytically inactive configuration through Mg2+-mediated interactions. The excess of the acidic residues and inherent flexibility of the coiled-coil tip might allow Gfh1 to adjust its activity to structurally distinct substrates, thereby inhibiting diverse catalytic reactions of RNA polymerase.

<ABSTRACT>
Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) is a sequence-specific, DNA binding, transcriptional repressor differentially expressed during embryogenesis and in adult tissues. PLZF is known to be a negative regulator of cell cycle progression. We used PLZF as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen with a cDNA library from the human ovary tissue. A novel cervical cancer suppressor 3 (CCS-3) was identified as a PLZF interacting partner. Further characterization revealed the BTB domain as an interacting domain of PLZF. Interaction of CCS-3 with PLZF in mammalian cells was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays. It was found that, although CCS-3 shares similar homology with eEF1A, the study determined CCS-3 to be an isoform. CCS-3 was observed to be downregulated in human cervical cell lines as well as in cervical tumors when compared to those from normal tissues. Overexpression of CCS-3 in human cervical cell lines inhibits cell growth by inducing apoptosis and suppressing human cyclin A2 promoter activity. These combined results suggest that the potential tumor suppressor activity of CCS-3 may be mediated by its interaction with PLZF.

<ABSTRACT>
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) uptake and reduction is widely used to evaluate cell proliferation and viability. MTT is taken up by the cells through endocytosis. We find that ouabain (1-200 nM) inhibits MTT reduction in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) without affecting cell viability. Ouabain does not inhibit MTT reduction when cell lysates substituted for the intact cells. Disruption of caveolae by cholesterol depletion, completely prevents the effect of ouabain. Treatment of HUVEC with Src inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine partially abrogates the inhibitory effect of ouabain. The data suggest that ouabain interaction with caveolar Na/K-ATPase inhibits MTT endocytosis through the activation of signaling proteins such as Src kinase.

<ABSTRACT>
Recently, it has been shown that really interesting new gene (RING)-in between ring finger (IBR)-RING domain-containing proteins, such as Parkin and Parc, are E3 ubiquitin ligases and are involved in regulation of apoptosis. In this report, we show that p53-inducible RING-finger protein (p53RFP), a p53-inducible E3 ubiquitin ligase, induces p53-dependent but caspase-independent apoptosis. p53RFP contains an N-terminal RING-IBR-RING domain and an uncharacterized, evolutionally highly conserved C-terminal domain. p53RFP interacts with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UbcH7 and UbcH8 but not with UbcH5, and this interaction is mediated through the RING-IBR-RING domain of p53RFP. Interestingly, the conserved C-terminal domain of p53RFP is required and sufficient for p53RFP-mediated apoptosis, suggesting p53RFP-mediated apoptosis does not require its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Together with a recent report showing that p53RFP is involved in ubiquitination and degradation of p21, a p53 downstream protein promoting growth arrest and antagonizing apoptosis, our findings suggest that p53RFP is involved in switching a cell from p53-mediated growth arrest to apoptosis.

The loss of PIN1 deregulates cyclin E and sensitizes mouse embryo
fibroblasts to genomic instability.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
During the G0/G1-S phase transition, the timely synthesis and degradation of key regulatory proteins is required for normal cell cycle progression. Two of these proteins, c-Myc and cyclin E, are recognized by the Cdc4 E3 ligase of the Skp1/Cul1/Rbx1 (SCF) complex. SCF(Cdc4) binds to a similar phosphodegron sequence in c-Myc and cyclin E proteins resulting in ubiquitylation and degradation of both proteins via the 26 S proteosome. Since the prolyl isomerase Pin1 binds the c-Myc phosphodegron and participates in regulation of c-Myc turnover, we hypothesized that Pin1 would bind to and regulate cyclin E turnover in a similar manner. Here we show that Pin1 regulates the turnover of cyclin E in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Pin1 binds to the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex in a manner that depends on Ser384 of cyclin E, which is phosphorylated by Cdk2. The absence of Pin1 results in an increased steady-state level of cyclin E and stalling of the cells in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. The cellular changes that result from the loss of Pin1 predispose Pin1 null mouse embryo fibroblasts to undergo more rapid genomic instability when immortalized by conditional inactivation of p53 and sensitizes these cells to more aggressive Ras-dependent transformation and tumorigenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
Coupling of Rab GTPase activation and SNARE complex assembly during membrane fusion is poorly understood. The homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex links these two processes: it is an effector for the vacuolar Rab GTPase Ypt7p and is required for vacuolar SNARE complex assembly. We now report that pure, active HOPS complex binds phosphoinositides and the PX domain of the vacuolar SNARE protein Vam7p. These binding interactions support HOPS complex association with the vacuole and explain its enrichment at the same microdomains on docked vacuoles as phosphoinositides, Ypt7p, Vam7p, and the other SNARE proteins. Concentration of the HOPS complex at these microdomains may be a key factor for coupling Rab GTPase activation to SNARE complex assembly.

TRPgamma channels are inhibited by cAMP and contribute to pacemaking in
neurosecretory insect neurons.

<ABSTRACT>
From a neuronal cDNA library of the cockroach Periplaneta americana we isolated a 3585-bp cDNA sequence encoding Periplaneta transient receptor potential gamma (pTRPgamma), a protein of 1194 amino acids showing 65% identity to the orthologous Drosophila channel protein dTRPgamma. Heterologous expression of pTRPgamma in HEK293 cells produced a constitutively active, non-selective cation channel with a Ca2+:Na+ permeability ratio of 2. In contrast to dTRPgamma-mediated currents, pTRPgamma currents were partially inhibited by 8-bromo-cAMP, and this effect was not mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) activation. pTRPgammab, a truncated pTRPgamma splice variant missing most of the C terminus, was insensitive to 8-bromo-cAMP. Thus, the critical cAMP-binding site seems to be located in the C-terminal part of pTRPgamma, although there is no common cAMP-binding consensus sequence. While dTRPgamma is only expressed in the photoreceptors, pTRPgamma is expressed throughout the nervous system. In particular it is expressed in dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons. In these octopamine-releasing, neurosecretory cells a Ca2+ background current contributing to pacemaker activity was found to be up-regulated by the reduction of cAMP level. In addition, the Ca2+ background current was inhibited by LOE-908, 2-APB, and La3+, which similarly affected the pTRPgamma current. We thus propose that the pTRPgamma protein is involved in forming the channel passing the Ca2+ pakemaking background current in DUM neurons.

DNA-damage-responsive acetylation of pRb regulates binding to E2F-1.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The pRb (retinoblastoma protein) tumour suppressor protein has a crucial role in regulating the G1- to S-phase transition, and its phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases is an established and important mechanism in controlling pRb activity. In addition, the targeted acetylation of lysine (K) residues 873/874 in the carboxy-terminal region of pRb located within a cyclin-dependent kinase-docking site hinders pRb phosphorylation and thereby retains pRb in an active state of growth suppression. Here, we report that the acetylation of pRb K873/874 occurs in response to DNA damage and that acetylation regulates the interaction between the C-terminal E2F-1-specific domain of pRb and E2F-1. These results define a new role for pRb acetylation in the DNA damage signalling pathway, and suggest that the interaction between pRb and E2F-1 is controlled by DNA-damage-dependent acetylation of pRb.

Cockayne syndrome B protein regulates the transcriptional program after UV
irradiation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The phenotype of the human genetic disorder Cockayne syndrome (CS) is not only due to DNA repair defect but also (and perhaps essentially) to a severe transcription initiation defect. After UV irradiation, even undamaged genes are not transcribed in CSB cells. Indeed, neither RNA pol II nor the associated basal transcription factors are recruited to the promoters of the housekeeping genes, around of which histone H4 acetylation is also deficient. Transfection of CSB restores the recruitment process of RNA pol II. On the contrary, the p53-responsive genes do not require CSB and are transcribed in both wild-type and CSB cells upon DNA damage. Altogether, our data highlight the pivotal role of CSB in initiating the transcriptional program of certain genes after UV irradiation, and also may explain some of the complex traits of CS patients.

Physical interaction and mutual transrepression between
CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta and the p53 tumor suppressor.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The tumor suppressor protein p53 is not only involved in defending cells against genotoxic insults but is also implicated in differentiation processes, a function that it shares with the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta). We previously reported an up-regulation of both factors in the cycle-dependent differentiation process of human endometrial stromal cells, termed decidualization. C/EBPbeta-mediated activation of a decidualization marker, the decidual prolactin promoter, was antagonized by p53. Here we report that C/EBPbeta in turn represses the transcriptional activity of p53. Competition for limiting amounts of coactivator CREB-binding protein/p300 was ruled out as the underlying mechanism of transrepression. Physical interaction between p53 and C/EBPbeta was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo and shown to depend on the C-terminal domains of both proteins. In gel shift experiments, C/EBPbeta reduced complex formation between p53 and its response element. Conversely, p53 strongly inhibited binding of endogenous C/EBPbeta from endometrial stromal cells to the C/EBP-responsive region in the decidual prolactin promoter. The observed negative cross-talk between p53 and C/EBPbeta is likely to impact expression of their respective target genes.

Extrasynaptic membrane trafficking regulated by GluR1 serine 845
phosphorylation primes AMPA receptors for long-term potentiation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Enhancement of synaptic transmission, as occurs in long-term potentiation (LTP), can result from several mechanisms that are regulated by phosphorylation of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR). Using a quantitative assay of net serine 845 (Ser-845) phosphorylation in the GluR1 subunit of AMPARs, we investigated the relationship between phospho-Ser-845, GluR1 surface expression, and synaptic strength in hippocampal neurons. About 15% of surface AMPARs in cultured neurons were phosphorylated at Ser-845 basally, whereas chemical potentiation (forskolin/rolipram treatment) persistently increased this to 60% and chemical depression (N-methyl-D-aspartate treatment) decreased it to 10%. These changes in Ser-845 phosphorylation were paralleled by corresponding changes in the surface expression of AMPARs in both cultured neurons and hippocampal slices. For every 1% increase in net phospho-Ser-845, there was 0.75% increase in the surface fraction of GluR1. Phosphorylation of Ser-845 correlated with a selective delivery of AMPARs to extrasynaptic sites, and their synaptic localization required coincident synaptic activity. Furthermore, increasing the extrasynaptic pool of AMPA receptors resulted in stronger theta burst LTP. Our results support a two-step model for delivery of GluR1-containing AMPARs to synapses during activity-dependent LTP, where Ser-845 phosphorylation can traffic AMPARs to extrasynaptic sites for subsequent delivery to synapses during LTP.

The GRIP1:IRF3 interaction as a target for glucocorticoid
receptor-mediated immunosuppression.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Glucocorticoids dramatically inhibit cytokine and chemokine production. They act through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor that binds to and represses activities of other DNA-bound regulators, activator protein 1 and nuclear factor kappaB, utilizing a p160 GRIP1 as a corepressor. A yeast two-hybrid screen with the GRIP1 corepression domain (RD) yielded interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF)3-a downstream effector of Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3/4 and an essential activator of several IFN and chemokine genes. We defined the GRIP1:IRF3 interface and showed that endogenous GRIP1 and IRF3 interact in mammalian cells. Interestingly, GR and IRF3 competed for GRIP1 binding; GR activation or GRIP1 knockdown in macrophages blocked whereas GRIP1 overexpression rescued IRF3-dependent gene expression. GR interference persisted in MyD88- and IFNA receptor-deficient mice, suggesting a specific disruption of TLR3-IRF3 pathway, not of autocrine IFN signaling. Finally, IRF3-stimulated response elements were necessary and sufficient for TLR3-dependent induction and glucocorticoid inhibition. Thus, GRIP1 plays a cofactor role in innate immunity. Competition with GR for GRIP1 antagonizes IRF3-mediated transcription, identifying the GRIP1:IRF3 interaction as a novel target for glucocorticoid immunosuppression.

Cytotoxicity of albebetin oligomers depends on cross-beta-sheet formation.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Prefibrillar cytotoxicity was suggested as a common amyloid characteristic. We showed two types of albebetin prefibrillar oligomers are formed during incubation at pH 7.3. Initial round-shaped oligomers consist of 10-15 molecules determined by atomic force microscopy, do not bind thioflavin-T and do not affect viability of granular neurons and SH-SY5Y cells. They are converted into ca. 30-40-mers possessing cross-beta-sheet and reducing viability of neuronal cells. Neither monomers nor fibrils possess cytotoxicity. We suggest that oligomeric size is important for stabilising cross-beta-sheet core critical for cytotoxicity. As albebetin was used as a carrier-protein for drug delivery, examination of amyloidogenicity is required prior polypeptide biomedical applications.

activation effects.

<ABSTRACT>
Human kallikrein 6 (hK6) is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system and is implicated in demyelinating disease. This study provided biochemical data about the substrate specificity and activation of hK6 by glycosaminoglycans and by kosmotropic salts, which followed the Hofmeister series. The screening of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptide families derived from Abz-KLRSSKQ-EDDnp resulted in the finding that Abz-AFRFSQ-EDDnp (where Abz is ortho-aminobenzoic acid and EDDnp is N-[2,4-dinitrophenyl]ethylenediamine)) is the best synthetic substrate described so far for hK6 (kcat/Km 38,667 s(-1) mm(-1)). It is noteworthy that the AFRFS sequence was found as a motif in the amino-terminal domain of seven human ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits. We also examined the hK6 hydrolytic activity on FRET peptides derived from human myelin basic protein, precursor of the Abeta amyloid peptide, reactive center loop of alpha1-antichymotrypsin, plasminogen, and maturation and inactivation cleavage sites of hK6, which were described earlier as natural substrates for hK6. The best substrates were derived from myelin basic protein. The hK6 maturation cleavage site was poorly hydrolyzed, and no evidence was found to support a two-step self-activation process reported previously. Finally, we assayed FRET peptides derived from sequences that span the cleavage sites for activation of protease-activated receptors (PAR) 1-4, and only the substrate with the PAR 2 sequence was hydrolyzed. These results further supported the hypothesis that hK6 expressed in the central nervous system is involved in normal myelin turnover/demyelination processes, but it is unlikely to self-activate. This report also suggested the possible modulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors and activation of PAR 2 by hK6.

Purified recombinant hARD1 does not catalyse acetylation of Lys532 of
HIF-1alpha fragments in vitro.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In humans, many responses to hypoxia including angiogenesis and erythropoiesis are mediated by the alpha/beta-heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). The stability and/or activity of human HIF-1alpha are modulated by post-translational modifications including prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation, phosphorylation, and reportedly by acetylation of the side-chain of Lys532 by ARD1 (arrest defective protein 1 homologue), an acetyltransferase. Using purified recombinant human ARD1 (hARD1) we did not observe ARD1-mediated N-acetylation of Lys532 using fragments of HIF-1alpha. However, recombinant hARD1 from Escherichia coli was produced with partial N-terminal acetylation and was observed to undergo slow self-mediated N-terminal acetylation. The observations are consistent with the other data indicating that hARD1, at least alone, does not acetylate HIF-1alpha, and with reports on the N-terminal acetyltransferase activity of a recently reported heterodimeric complex comprising hARD1 and N-acetyltransferase protein.

Acceleration of alpha-synuclein aggregation by homologous peptides.

<ABSTRACT>
alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn), amyloid beta-protein and prion protein are among the amyloidogenic proteins that are associated with the neurodegenerative diseases. These three proteins share a homologous region with a consensus sequence mainly consisting of glycine, alanine and valine residues (accordingly named as the GAV motif), which was proposed to be the critical core for the fibrillization and cytotoxicity. To understand the role of the GAV motif in protein amyloidogenesis, we studied the effects of the homologous peptides corresponding to the sequence of GAV motif region (residues 66-74) on alpha-Syn aggregation. The result shows that these peptides can promote fibrillization of wild-type alpha-Syn and induce that of the charge-incorporated mutants but not the GAV-deficient alpha-Syn mutant. The acceleration of alpha-Syn aggregation by the homologous peptides is under a sequence-specific manner. The interplay between the GAV peptide and the core regions in alpha-Syn may accelerate the aggregation process and stabilize the fibrils. This finding provides clues for developing peptide mimics that could promote transforming the toxic oligomers or protofibrils into the inert mature fibrils.

Dual role of the exocyst in AMPA receptor targeting and insertion into the
postsynaptic membrane.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Intracellular membrane trafficking of glutamate receptors at excitatory synapses is critical for synaptic function. However, little is known about the specialized trafficking events occurring at the postsynaptic membrane. We have found that two components of the exocyst complex, Sec8 and Exo70, separately control synaptic targeting and insertion of AMPA-type glutamate receptors. Sec8 controls the directional movement of receptors towards synapses through PDZ-dependent interactions. In contrast, Exo70 mediates receptor insertion at the postsynaptic membrane, but it does not participate in receptor targeting. Thus, interference with Exo70 function accumulates AMPA receptors inside the spine, forming a complex physically associated, but not yet fused with the postsynaptic membrane. Electron microscopic analysis of these complexes indicates that Exo70 mediates AMPA receptor insertion directly within the postsynaptic density, rather than at extrasynaptic membranes. Therefore, we propose a molecular and anatomical model that dissects AMPA receptor sorting and synaptic delivery within the spine, and uncovers new functions of the exocyst at the postsynaptic membrane.

Identification of a switch in neurotrophin signaling by selective tyrosine
phosphorylation.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, activate Trk receptor tyrosine kinases through receptor dimerization at the cell surface followed by autophosphorylation and recruitment of intracellular signaling molecules. The intracellular pathways used by neurotrophins share many common protein substrates that are used by other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), such as Shc, Grb2, FRS2, and phospholipase C-gamma. Here we describe a novel RTK mechanism that involves a 220-kilodalton membrane tetraspanning protein, ARMS/Kidins220, which is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in primary neurons after neurotrophin treatment. ARMS/Kidins220 undergoes multiple tyrosine phosphorylation events and also serine phosphorylation by protein kinase D. We have identified a single tyrosine (Tyr(1096)) phosphorylation event in ARMS/Kidins220 that plays a critical role in neurotrophin signaling. A reassembled complex of ARMS/Kidins220 and CrkL, an upstream component of the C3G-Rap1-MAP kinase cascade, is SH3-dependent. However, Tyr(1096) phosphorylation enables ARMS/Kidins220 to recruit CrkL through its SH2 domain, thereby freeing the CrkL SH3 domain to engage C3G for MAP kinase activation in a neurotrophin dependent manner. Accordingly, mutation of Tyr(1096) abolished CrkL interaction and sustained MAPK kinase activity, a response that is not normally observed in other RTKs. Therefore, Trk receptor signaling involves an inducible switch mechanism through an unconventional substrate that distinguishes neurotrophin action from other growth factor receptors.

receptor degradation by regulating endocytic trafficking from the late

</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family. Ligand (epidermal growth factor or EGF) binding to the EGFR results in the coordinated activation and integration of biochemical signaling events to mediate cell growth, migration, and differentiation. One mechanism the cell utilizes to orchestrate these events is ligand-mediated endocytosis through the canonical clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. Identification of proteins that regulate the intracellular movement of the EGF.EGFR complex is an important first step in dissecting how specificity of EGFR signaling is conferred. We examined the role of the small molecular weight guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) rab7 as a regulator of the distal stages of the endocytic pathway. Through the transient expression of activating and inactivating mutants of rab7 in HeLa cells, we have determined that rab7 activity directly correlates with the rate of radiolabeled EGF and EGFR degradation. Furthermore, when inhibitory mutants of rab7 are expressed, the internalized EGF.EGFR complex accumulates in high-density endosomes that are characteristic of the late endocytic pathway. Thus, we conclude that rab7 regulates the endocytic trafficking of the EGF.EGFR complex by regulating its lysosomal degradation.

<ABSTRACT>
Transcriptional silencing in yeast is mediated by the interactions of silent information regulator (Sir) proteins with chromatin and with one another. The stable association of Sir3 with Sir4 is mediated by a C-terminal region of Sir3 that has additional functions including the dimerization of Sir3. We have developed a simple, robust expression screening methodology that allows for the unbiased identification of functional protein domains expressed from nested-deletion libraries of full-length genes. Using these methodologies, Sir3 dimerization was shown to be mediated by two separate domains. One of these domains also binds cooperatively to the C-terminal coiled-coil motif of Sir4 and dimerization further increases the affinity of Sir3 for Sir4. The resulting Sir3-Sir4 complexes form progressively higher order assemblies with increasing protein concentration, with implications for the mechanism of gene silencing.

<ABSTRACT>
A new apoptosis cascade mediated by lysosomal lactoferrin was found in apoptotic liver induced by d-galactosamine. Caspase-3 and lactoferrin were increased in the apoptotic liver cytoplasm and serum transaminases were elevated. Recombinant lactoferrin stimulated procaspase-3 processing at 10(-6)-10(-7)M to an extent similar to that by granzyme B in vitro. Lactoferrin changed procaspase-3 structure susceptible to the processing. Synthetic peptide Y(679)-K(695) in lactoferrin molecule inhibited the processing of procaspase-3 by lactoferrin. Lactoferrin in lysosomes was decreased and lactoferrin released into cytoplasm was increased quantitatively in d-galactosamine induced apoptotic liver, and procaspase-3 in cytoplasm was processed to caspase-3.

<ABSTRACT>
The beta-carbon of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1244 pilin C-terminal Ser is a site of glycosylation. The present study was conducted to determine the pilin structures necessary for glycosylation. It was found that although Thr could be tolerated at the pilin C terminus, the blocking of the Ser carboxyl group with the addition of an Ala prevented glycosylation. Pilin from strain PA103 was not glycosylated by P. aeruginosa 1244, even when the C-terminal residue was converted to Ser. Substituting the disulfide loop region of strain PA103 pilin with that of strain 1244 allowed glycosylation to take place. Neither conversion of 1244 pilin disulfide loop Cys residues to Ala nor the deletion of segments of this structure prevented glycosylation. It was noted that the PA103 pilin disulfide loop environment was electronegative, whereas that of strain 1244 pilin had an overall positive charge. Insertion of a positive charge into the PA103 pilin disulfide loop of a mutant containing Ser at the C terminus allowed glycosylation to take place. Extending the "tail" region of the PA103 mutant pilin containing Ser at its terminus resulted in robust glycosylation. These results suggest that the terminal Ser is the major pilin glycosylation recognition feature and that this residue cannot be substituted at its carboxyl group. Although no other specific recognition features are present, the pilin surface must be compatible with the reaction apparatus for glycosylation to occur.

<ABSTRACT>
Prion protein (PrP) amyloid formation is a central feature of genetic and acquired prion diseases such as Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The major component of GSS amyloid is a PrP fragment spanning residues approximately 82-146, which when synthesized as a peptide, readily forms fibrils featuring GSS amyloid. The present study employed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to characterize the binding events underlying PrP82-146 oligomerization at the first stages of fibrillization, according to evidence suggesting a pathogenic role of prefibrillar oligomers rather than mature amyloid fibrils. We followed in real time the binding reactions occurring during short term (seconds) addition of PrP82-146 small oligomers (1-5-mers, flowing species) onto soluble prefibrillar PrP82-146 aggregates immobilized on the sensor surface. SPR data confirmed very efficient aggregation/elongation, consistent with the hypothesis of nucleation-dependent polymerization process. Much lower binding was observed when PrP82-146 flowed onto the scrambled sequence of PrP82-146 or onto prefibrillar Abeta42 aggregates. As previously found with Abeta40, SPR data could be adequately fitted by equations modeling the "dock-and-lock" mechanism, in which the "locking" step is due to sequential conformational changes, each increasing the affinity of the monomer for the fibril until a condition of irreversible binding is reached. However, these conformational changes (i.e. the locking steps) appear to be faster and easier with PrP82-146 than with Abeta40. Such differences suggest that PrP82-146 has a greater propensity to polymerize and greater stability of the aggregates.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
ALE-1, a homologue of lysostaphin, is a peptidoglycan hydrolase that specifically lyses Staphylococcus aureus cell walls by cleaving the pentaglycine linkage between the peptidoglycan chains. Binding of ALE-1 to S. aureus cells through its C-terminal 92 residues, known as the targeting domain, is functionally important for staphylolytic activity. The ALE-1-targeting domain belongs to the SH3b domain family, the prokaryotic counterpart of the eukaryotic SH3 domains. The 1.75 angstroms crystal structure of the targeting domain shows an all-beta fold similar to typical SH3s but with unique features. The structure reveals patches of conserved residues among orthologous targeting domains, forming surface regions that can potentially interact with some common features of the Gram-positive cell wall. ALE-1-targeting domain binding studies employing various bacterial peptidoglycans demonstrate that the length of the interpeptide bridge, as well as the amino acid composition of the peptide, confers the maximum binding of the targeting domain to the staphylococcal peptidoglycan. Truncation of the highly conserved first 9 N-terminal residues results in loss of specificity to S. aureus cell wall-targeting, suggesting that these residues confer specificity to S. aureus cell wall.

<ABSTRACT>
Type III secretion machinery (TTSM), composed of a needle, a basal body, and a C-ring compartment, delivers a subset of effectors into host cells. Here, we show that Shigella Spa33 is an essential component of the C-ring compartment involved in mediating the transit of various TTSM-associated translocated proteins. Electron microscopic analysis and pull-down assay revealed Spa33 to be localized beneath the TTSM via interaction with MxiG and MxiJ (basal body components). Spa33 is also capable of interacting with Spa47 (TTSM ATPase), MxiK, MxiN (required for the transit of MxiH, the needle component), Spa32 (required for determining needle length), and several effectors. Genetic and functional analyses of the Spa33 C-terminal region, which is highly conserved in the SpaO-YscQ-HrcQ(B)-FliN family, indicate that some of the conserved residues are crucial for needle formation via interactions with MxiN. Thus, Spa33 plays a central role as the C-ring component in recruiting/exporting TTSM-associated proteins.

The Sld2 and Dpb11 proteins of budding yeast form a phosphorylation-dependent complex that is essential for chromosomal DNA replication. The Sld2 protein has a cluster of 11 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation motifs (Ser/Thr-Pro), six of which match the canonical sequences Ser/Thr-Pro-X-Lys/Arg, Lys/Arg-Ser/Thr-Pro and Ser/Thr-Pro-Lys/Arg. Simultaneous alanine substitution for serine or threonine in all the canonical CDK-phosphorylation motifs severely reduces complex formation between Sld2 and Dpb11, and inhibits DNA replication. Here we show that phosphorylation of these canonical motifs does not play a direct role in complex formation, but rather regulates phosphorylation of another residue, Thr84. This constitutes a non-canonical CDK-phosphorylation motif within a 28-amino-acid sequence that is responsible, after phosphorylation, for binding of Sld2-Dpb11. We further suggest that CDK-catalysed phosphorylation of sites other than Thr84 renders Thr84 accessible to CDK. Finally, we argue that this novel mechanism sets a threshold of CDK activity for formation of the essential Sld2 to Dpb11 complex and therefore prevents premature DNA replication.

<ABSTRACT>
Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is an hnRNP with four RRM type domains. It plays roles as a repressive alternative splicing regulator of multilple target genes, as well as being involved in pre-mRNA 3' end processing, mRNA localization, stability, and internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation. Here we have used a tethered function assay, in which a fusion protein of PTB and the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein is recruited to a splicing regulatory site by binding to an artificially inserted MS2 binding site. Deletion mutations of PTB in this system allowed us to identify RRM2 and the following inter-RRM linker region as the minimal region of PTB that can act as splicing repressor domain when recruited to RNA. Splicing repression by the minimal repressor domain remained cell type-specific and dependent upon other defined regulatory elements in the alpha-tropomyosin test minigene. Our results highlight the fact that splicing repression by PTB can be uncoupled from the mode by which it binds to RNA.

<ABSTRACT>
Presequence protease PreP is a novel protease that degrades targeting peptides as well as other unstructured peptides in both mitochondria and chloroplasts. The first structure of PreP from Arabidopsis thaliana refined at 2.1 Angstroms resolution shows how the 995-residue polypeptide forms a unique proteolytic chamber of more than 10,000 Angstroms(3) in which the active site resides. Although there is no visible opening to the chamber, a peptide is bound to the active site. The closed conformation places previously unidentified residues from the C-terminal domain at the active site, separated by almost 800 residues in sequence to active site residues located in the N-terminal domain. Based on the structure, a novel mechanism for proteolysis is proposed involving hinge-bending motions that cause the protease to open and close in response to substrate binding. In support of this model, cysteine double mutants designed to keep the chamber covalently locked show no activity under oxidizing conditions. The manner in which substrates are processed inside the chamber is reminiscent of the proteasome; therefore, we refer to this protein as a peptidasome.

<ABSTRACT>
Naturally occurring mutants of membrane and secretory proteins are often associated with the pathogenesis of human diseases. Here, we describe the molecular basis of a novel phenotype of congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID), a disaccharide malabsorption disorder of the human intestine in which several structural features and functional capacities of the brush-border enzyme complex sucrase-isomaltase (SI) are affected. The cDNA encoding SI from a patient with CSID reveals a mutation in the isomaltase subunit of SI that results in the substitution of a cysteine by an arginine at amino acid residue 635 (C635R). When this mutation is introduced into the wild type cDNA of SI a mutant enzyme, SI(C635R), is generated that shows a predominant localization in the endoplasmic reticulum. Nevertheless, a definite localization of SI(C635R) in the Golgi apparatus and at the cell surface could be also observed. Epitope mapping with conformation-specific mAbs protease sensitivity assays, and enzymatic activity measurements demonstrate an altered folding pattern of SI(C635R) that is responsible for a substantially increased turnover rate and an aberrant sorting profile. Thus, SI(C635R) becomes distributed also at the basolateral membrane in contrast to wild type SI. Concomitant with the altered sorting pattern, the partial detergent extractability of wild type SI shifts to a complete detergent solubility with Triton X-100. The mutation has therefore affected an epitope responsible for the apical targeting fidelity of SI. Altogether, the combined effects of the C635R mutation on the turnover rate, function, polarized sorting, and detergent solubility of SI constitute a unique and novel pathomechanism of CSID.

Molecular analysis of survivin isoforms: evidence that alternatively

</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Survivin is a protein with proposed roles in cell division and apoptosis. Transcripts encoding splice variants of human survivin have been described and their expression correlated with cancer progression. As survivin forms homodimers in vitro, it has been suggested that these isoforms could interfere with wild type function by forming heterodimers. Here we show that survivin-2beta and survivin-deltaEx3 can interact with wild type survivin but have reduced affinity for the partner protein of survivin, borealin, and thus do not localize with the chromosomal passenger complex in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that overexpression of survivin-2beta-green fluorescent protein (GFP) or survivin-deltaEx3-GFP does not impede cell cycle progression. We also report that wild type survivin, but not survivin-2beta-GFP or survivin-deltaEx3-GFP, can rescue cell proliferation inhibited by small interfering RNA-mediated survivin depletion. These data suggest that, despite their ability to interact with wild type survivin, neither of these isoforms acts as its competitor during mitosis nor has an essential function.

</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
TGF-beta signaling involves a wide array of signaling molecules and multiple controlling events. Scaffold proteins create a functional proximity of signaling molecules and control the specificity of signal transduction. While many components involved in the TGF-beta pathway have been elucidated, little is known about how those components are coordinated by scaffold proteins. Here, we show that Axin activates TGF-beta signaling by forming a multimeric complex consisting of Smad7 and ubiquitin E3 ligase Arkadia. Axin depends on Arkadia to facilitate TGF-beta signaling, as their small interfering RNAs reciprocally abolished the stimulatory effect on TGF-beta signaling. Specific knockdown of Axin or Arkadia revealed that Axin and Arkadia cooperate with each other in promoting Smad7 ubiquitination. Pulse-chase experiments further illustrated that Axin significantly decreased the half-life of Smad7. Axin also induces nuclear export of Smad7. Interestingly, Axin associates with Arkadia and Smad7 independently of TGF-beta signal, in contrast to its transient association with inactive Smad3. However, coexpression of Wnt-1 reduced Smad7 ubiquitination by downregulating Axin levels, underscoring the importance of Axin as an intrinsic regulator in TGF-beta signaling.

Hypoxia-induced fatty acid transporter translocation increases fatty acid
transport and contributes to lipid accumulation in the heart.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Protein-mediated LCFA transport across plasma membranes is highly regulated by the fatty acid transporters FAT/CD36 and FABPpm. Physiologic stimuli (insulin stimulation, AMP kinase activation) induce the translocation of one or both transporters to the plasma membrane and increase the rate of LCFA transport. In the hypoxic/ischemic heart, intramyocardial lipid accumulation has been attributed to a reduced rate of fatty acid oxidation. However, since acute hypoxia (15 min) activates AMPK, we examined whether an increased accumulation of intramyocardial lipid during hypoxia was also attributable to an increased rate of LCFA uptake as a result AMPK-induced translocation of FAT/CD36 and FABPpm. In cardiac myocytes, hypoxia (15 min) induced the redistribution of FAT/CD36 from an intracellular pool (LDM) (-25%, P<0.05) to the plasma membranes (PM) (+54%, P<0.05). Hypoxia also induced an increase in FABPpm at the PM (+56%, P<0.05) and a concomitant FABPpm reduction in the LDM (-24%, P<0.05). Similarly, in intact, Langendorff perfused hearts, hypoxia induced the translocation of a both FAT/CD36 and FABPpm to the PM (+66% and +61%, respectively, P<0.05), with a concomitant decline in FAT/CD36 and FABPpm in the LDM (-24% and -23%, respectively, P<0.05). Importantly, the increased plasmalemmal content of these transporters was associated with increases in the initial rates of palmitate uptake into cardiac myocytes (+40%, P<0.05). Acute hypoxia also redirected palmitate into intracellular lipid pools, mainly to PL and TG (+48% and +28%, respectively, P<0.05), while fatty acid oxidation was reduced (-35%, P<0.05). Thus, our data indicate that the increased intracellular lipid accumulation in hypoxic hearts is attributable to both: (a) a reduced rate of fatty acid oxidation and (b) an increased rate of fatty acid transport into the heart, the latter being attributable to a hypoxia-induced translocation of fatty acid transporters.

Structure of the human Papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein and its mechanism for

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The E7 oncoprotein from human Papillomavirus (HPV) mediates cell transformation in part by binding to the human pRb tumor suppressor protein and E2F transcription factors, resulting in the dissociation of pRb from E2F transcription factors and the premature cell progression into the S-phase of the cell cycle. This activity is mediated by the LXCXE motif and the CR3 zinc binding domain of the E7 protein. In this study we report the x-ray crystal structure of the CR3 region of HPV E7 and a structure-based mutational analysis to investigate its mode of pRb and E2F binding and E2F displacement from pRb. The structure reveals a novel zinc-bound E7-CR3 obligate homodimer that contains two surface patches of sequence conservation. Mutation of residues within these patches reveals that one patch is required for pRb binding, whereas the other is required for E2F binding. We also show that both E7-mediated interactions are required to disrupt pRb.E2F complexes. Based on these studies we present a mechanistic model for how E7 displaces E2F from pRb. Because the CR3 region of HPV E7 has no detectable homology to other human proteins, the structure-function studies presented here provide an avenue for developing small molecule compounds that inhibit HPV-E7-mediated cell transformation.

Directed evolution of a yeast arsenate reductase into a protein-tyrosine

<ABSTRACT>
Arsenic, which is ubiquitous in the environment and comes from both geochemical and anthropogenic sources, has become a worldwide public health problem. Every organism studied has intrinsic or acquired mechanisms for arsenic detoxification. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae arsenate is detoxified by Acr2p, an arsenate reductase. Acr2p is not a phosphatase but is a homologue of CDC25 phosphatases. It has the HCX5R phosphatase motif but not the glycine-rich phosphate binding motif (GXGXXG) that is found in protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Here we show that creation of a phosphate binding motif through the introduction of glycines at positions 79, 81, and 84 in Acr2p resulted in a gain of phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity and a loss of arsenate reductase activity. Arsenate likely achieved geochemical abundance only after the atmosphere became oxidizing, creating pressure for the evolution of an arsenate reductase from a protein-tyrosine phosphatase. The ease by which an arsenate reductase can be converted into a protein-tyrosine phosphatase supports this hypothesis.

RNA editing and alternative splicing: the importance of co-transcriptional

<ABSTRACT>
The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) is essential for several co-transcriptional pre-messenger RNA processing events, including capping, 3'-end processing and splicing. We investigated the role of the CTD of RNA pol II in the coordination of A to I editing and splicing of the ADAR2 (ADAR: adenosine deaminases that act on RNA) pre-mRNA. The auto-editing of Adar2 intron 4 by the ADAR2 adenosine deaminase is tightly coupled to splicing, as the modification of the dinucleotide AA to AI creates a new 3' splice site. Unlike other introns, the CTD is not required for efficient splicing of intron 4 at either the normal 3' splice site or the alternative site created by editing. However, the CTD is required for efficient co-transcriptional auto-editing of ADAR2 intron 4. Our results implicate the CTD in site-selective RNA editing by ADAR2 and in coordination of editing with alternative splicing.

<ABSTRACT>
Leukocyte recruitment and effector functions like phagocytosis and respiratory burst are key elements of immunity to infection. Pathogen survival is dependent upon the ability to overwhelm, evade or inhibit the immune system. Pathogenic group A and group B streptococci are well known to produce virulence factors that block the binding of IgA to the leukocyte IgA receptor, Fc alphaRI, thereby inhibiting IgA-mediated immunity. Recently we found Staphylococcus aureus also interferes with IgA-mediated effector functions as the putative virulence factor SSL7 also binds IgA and blocks binding to Fc alphaRI. Herein we report that SSL7 and Fc alphaRI bind many of the same key residues in the Fc region of human IgA. Residues Leu-257 and Leu-258 in domain C alpha2 and residues 440-443 PLAF in C alpha3 of IgA lie at the C alpha2/C alpha3 interface and make major contributions to the binding of both the leukocyte receptor Fc alphaRI and SSL7. It is remarkable this S. aureus IgA binding factor and unrelated factors from streptococci are functionally convergent, all targeting a number of the same residues in the IgA Fc, which comprise the binding site for the leukocyte IgA receptor, Fc alphaRI.

Glycine-alanine repeats impair proper substrate unfolding by the
proteasome.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteasome ATPases unravel folded proteins. Introducing a sequence containing only glycine and alanine residues (GAr) into substrates can impair their digestion. We previously proposed that a GAr interferes with the unfolding capacity of the proteasome, leading to partial degradation of products. Here we tested that idea in several ways. Stabilizing or destabilizing a folded domain within substrate proteins changed GAr-mediated intermediate production in the way predicted by the model. A downstream folded domain determined the sites of terminal proteolysis. The spacing between a GAr and a folded domain was critical for intermediate production. Intermediates containing a GAr did not remain associated with proteasomes, excluding models whereby retained GAr-containing proteins halt further processing. The following model is supported: a GAr positioned within the ATPase ring reduces the efficiency of coupling between nucleotide hydrolysis and work performed on the substrate. If this impairment takes place when unfolding must be initiated, insertion pauses and proteolysis is limited to the portion of the substrate that has already entered the catalytic chamber of the proteasome.

<ABSTRACT>
The structure and dynamics of the enzyme-substrate complex of Bacillus 1,3-1,4-beta-glucanase, one of the most active glycoside hydrolases, is investigated by means of Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations (CPMD) combined with force field molecular dynamics (QM/MM CPMD). It is found that the substrate sugar ring located at the -1 subsite adopts a distorted 1S3 skew-boat conformation upon binding to the enzyme. With respect to the undistorted 4C1 chair conformation, the 1S3 skew-boat conformation is characterized by: (a) an increase of charge at the anomeric carbon (C1), (b) an increase of the distance between C1 and the leaving group, and (c) a decrease of the intraring O5-C1 distance. Therefore, our results clearly show that the distorted conformation resembles both structurally and electronically the transition state of the reaction in which the substrate acquires oxocarbenium ion character, and the glycosidic bond is partially broken. Together with analysis of the substrate conformational dynamics, it is concluded that the main determinants of substrate distortion have a structural origin. To fit into the binding pocket, it is necessary that the aglycon leaving group is oriented toward the beta region, and the skew-boat conformation naturally fulfills this premise. Only when the aglycon is removed from the calculation the substrate recovers the all-chair conformation, in agreement with the recent determination of the enzyme product structure. The QM/MM protocol developed here is able to predict the conformational distortion of substrate binding in glycoside hydrolases because it accounts for polarization and charge reorganization at the -1 sugar ring. It thus provides a powerful tool to model E.S complexes for which experimental information is not yet available.

<ABSTRACT>
Protein-tyrosine kinases and Rho GTPases regulate many cellular processes, including the reorganization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and its homolog neuronal WASP (N-WASP) are effectors of the Rho GTPase Cdc42 and provide a direct link between activated membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton. WASP and N-WASP are also regulated by a large number of other activators, including protein-tyrosine kinases, phosphoinositides, and Src homology 3-containing adaptor proteins, and can therefore serve as signal integrators inside cells. Here we show that Cdc42 and the Src family kinase Lck cooperate at two levels to enhance WASP activation. First, autoinhibition in N-WASP decreases the efficiency (kcat/Km) of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the GTPase binding domain by 30- and 40-fold, respectively, and this effect is largely reversed by Cdc42. Second, Cdc42 and the Src homology 3-Src homology 2 module of Lck cooperatively stimulate the activity of phosphorylated WASP, with coupling energy of approximately 2.4 kcal/mol between the two activators. These combined effects provide mechanisms for high specificity in WASP activation by coincident GTPase and kinase signals.

alpha-Dystroglycan was quantitatively enriched from mammalian brain based on its uniform reactivity with Vicia villosa agglutinin and resolved into sub-populations possessing or lacking the sulfated glucuronic acid epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody HNK-1. We generated a new monoclonal antibody specific for a glycoepitope on brain alpha-dystroglycan but absent from alpha-dystroglycan expressed in all other tissues examined. Finally, we found that laminin-10/11 preferentially bound to brain alpha-dystroglycan compared to skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan. Our results suggest that tissue-specific glycosylation modifies the laminin binding specificity of alpha-dystroglycan.

Src phosphorylation and signaling.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Bidirectional signaling triggered by interacting ephrinB receptors (EphB) and ephrinB ligands is crucial for development and function of the vascular and nervous systems. A signaling cascade triggered by this interaction involves activation of Src kinase and phosphorylation of ephrinB. The mechanism, however, by which EphB activates Src in the ephrinB-expressing cells is unknown. Here we show that EphB stimulates a metalloproteinase cleavage of ephrinB2, producing a carboxy-terminal fragment that is further processed by PS1/gamma-secretase to produce intracellular peptide ephrinB2/CTF2. This peptide binds Src and inhibits its association with inhibitory kinase Csk, allowing autophosphorylation of Src at residue tyr418. EphrinB2/CTF2-activated Src phosphorylates ephrinB2 and inhibits its processing by gamma-secretase. These data show that the PS1/gamma-secretase system controls Src activation and ephrinB phosphorylation by regulating production of Src activator ephrinB2/CTF2. Accordingly, gamma-secretase inhibitors prevented the EphB-induced sprouting of endothelial cells and the recruitment of Grb4 to ephrinB. PS1 FAD and gamma-secretase dominant-negative mutants inhibited the EphB-induced cleavage of ephrinB2 and Src autophosphorylation, raising the possibility that FAD mutants interfere with the functions of Src and ephrinB2 in the CNS.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) acts on several kinases in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway but whether a specific holoenzyme dephosphorylates ERK and whether this activity is controlled during mitogenic stimulation is unknown. By using both RNA interference and overexpression of PP2A B regulatory subunits, we show that B56, but not B, family members of PP2A increase ERK dephosphorylation, without affecting its activation by MEK. Induction of the early gene product and ERK substrate IEX-1 (ier3) by growth factors leads to opposite effects and reverses B56-PP2A-mediated ERK dephosphorylation. IEX-1 binds to B56 subunits and pERK independently, enhances B56 phosphorylation by ERK at a conserved Ser/Pro site in this complex and triggers dissociation from the catalytic subunit. This is the first demonstration of the involvement of B56-containing PP2A in ERK dephosphorylation and of a B56-specific cellular protein inhibitor regulating its activity in an ERK-dependent fashion. In addition, our results raise a new paradigm in ERK signaling in which ERK associated to a substrate can transphosphorylate nearby proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) induces actin reorganization and migration of endothelial cells through a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. LIM-kinase 1 (LIMK1) induces actin remodeling by phosphorylating and inactivating cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing factor. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of LIMK1 by MAPKAPK-2 (MK2; a downstream kinase of p38 MAPK) represents a novel signaling pathway in VEGF-A-induced cell migration. VEGF-A induced LIMK1 activation and cofilin phosphorylation, and this was inhibited by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Although p38 phosphorylated LIMK1 at Ser-310, it failed to activate LIMK1 directly; however, MK2 activated LIMK1 by phosphorylation at Ser-323. Expression of a Ser-323-non-phosphorylatable mutant of LIMK1 suppressed VEGF-A-induced stress fiber formation and cell migration; however, expression of a Ser-323-phosphorylation-mimic mutant enhanced these processes. Knockdown of MK2 by siRNA suppressed VEGF-A-induced LIMK1 activation, stress fiber formation, and cell migration. Expression of kinase-dead LIMK1 suppressed VEGF-A-induced tubule formation. These findings suggest that MK2-mediated LIMK1 phosphorylation/activation plays an essential role in VEGF-A-induced actin reorganization, migration, and tubule formation of endothelial cells.

<ABSTRACT>
The docking protein Gab2 is a proto-oncogene product that is overexpressed in primary breast cancers. To determine the functional consequences of Gab2 overexpression, we utilized the immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. In monolayer culture, expression of Gab2 at levels comparable with those detected in human breast cancer cells accelerated epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell cycle progression and was associated with increased basal Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced and/or more sustained EGF-induced Erk and Akt activation. Three-dimensional Matrigel culture of MCF-10A cells resulted in the formation of polarized, growth-arrested acini with hollow lumina. Under these conditions, Gab2 increased cell proliferation during morphogenesis, leading to significantly larger acini, an effect dependent on Gab2 binding to Grb2 and Shp2 and enhanced by recruitment of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Pharmacological inhibition of MEK revealed that, in addition to direct activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, increased Erk signaling also contributed to Gab2-mediated enhancement of acinar size. In addition, Gab2 overcame the proliferative suppression that normally occurs in late stage cultures and conferred independence of the morphogenetic program from exogenous EGF. Finally, higher levels of Gab2 expression led to the formation of large disorganized structures with defective luminal clearance. These findings support a role for Gab2 in mammary tumorigenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), a serine/threonine kinase that regulates DNA damage checkpoints, is destabilized when heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is inhibited, suggesting that Chk1 is an Hsp90 client. In the present work we examined the interplay between Chk1 and Hsp90 in intact cells, identified a source of unchaperoned Chk1, and report the in vitro chaperoning of Chk1 in reticulocyte lysates and with purified chaperones and co-chaperones. We find that bacterially expressed Chk1 is post-translationally chaperoned to an active kinase. This reaction minimally requires Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp40, Cdc37, and the protein kinase CK2. The co-chaperone Hop, although not essential for the activation of Chk1 in vitro, enhanced the chaperoning process, whereas the co-chaperone p23 did not stimulate the chaperoning reaction. Additionally, we found that the C-terminal regulatory domain of Chk1 affects the association of Chk1 with Hsp90. Collectively these results provide new insights into Hsp90-dependent chaperoning of a client kinase and identify a novel, biochemically tractable model system that will be useful to further dissect the Hsp90-dependent chaperoning of this important and ubiquitous class of Hsp90 clients.

Two subtypes of ecdysis-triggering hormone receptor in Drosophila
melanogaster.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

<ABSTRACT>
Insect ecdysis is a hormonally programmed physiological sequence that enables insects to escape their old cuticle at the end of each developmental stage. The immediate events leading to ecdysis, which are initiated upon release of ecdysis-triggering hormones (ETH) into the bloodstream, include respiratory inflation and sequential stereotypic behaviors that facilitate shedding of the cuticle. Here we report that the Drosophila gene CG5911 encodes two functionally distinct subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors through alternative splicing (CG5911a and CG5911b) that respond preferentially to ecdysis-triggering hormones of flies and moths. These subtypes show differences in ligand sensitivity and specificity, suggesting that they may play separate roles in ETH signaling. At significantly higher concentrations (>100-fold), certain insect and vertebrate peptides also activate these receptors, providing evidence that CG5911 is evolutionarily related to the thyrotropin-releasing hormone and neuromedin U receptors. The ETH signaling system in insects is a vital system that provides opportunities for the construction of models for the molecular basis of stereotypic animal behavior as well as a target for the design of more sophisticated insect-selective pest control strategies.

Nucleotide flips determine the specificity of the Ecl18kI restriction
endonuclease.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Restricion endonuclease Ecl18kI is specific for the sequence /CCNGG and cleaves it before the outer C to generate 5 nt 5'-overhangs. It has been suggested that Ecl18kI is evolutionarily related to NgoMIV, a 6-bp cutter that cleaves the sequence G/CCGGC and leaves 4 nt 5'-overhangs. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Ecl18kI-DNA complex at 1.7 A resolution and compare it with the known structure of the NgoMIV-DNA complex. We find that Ecl18kI flips both central nucleotides within the CCNGG sequence and buries the extruded bases in pockets within the protein. Nucleotide flipping disrupts Watson-Crick base pairing, induces a kink in the DNA and shifts the DNA register by 1 bp, making the distances between scissile phosphates in the Ecl18kI and NgoMIV cocrystal structures nearly identical. Therefore, the two enzymes can use a conserved DNA recognition module, yet recognize different sequences, and form superimposable dimers, yet generate different cleavage patterns. Hence, Ecl18kI is the first example of a restriction endonuclease that flips nucleotides to achieve specificity for its recognition site.

The discovery of SycO highlights a new function for type III secretion
effector chaperones.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Bacterial injectisomes deliver effector proteins straight into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells (type III secretion, T3S). Many effectors are associated with a specific chaperone that remains inside the bacterium when the effector is delivered. The structure of such chaperones and the way they interact with their substrate is well characterized but their main function remains elusive. Here, we describe and characterize SycO, a new chaperone for the Yersinia effector kinase YopO. The chaperone-binding domain (CBD) within YopO coincides with the membrane localization domain (MLD) targeting YopO to the host cell membrane. The CBD/MLD causes intrabacterial YopO insolubility and the binding of SycO prevents this insolubility but not folding and activity of the kinase. Similarly, SycE masks the MLD of YopE and SycT covers an aggregation-prone domain of YopT, presumably corresponding to its MLD. Thus, SycO, SycE and most likely SycT mask, inside the bacterium, a domain needed for proper localization of their cognate effector in the host cell. We propose that covering an MLD might be an essential function of T3S effector chaperones.

Rsp5 regulates expression of stress proteins via post-translational
modification of Hsf1 and Msn4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
</TITLE>

NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Rsp5 is an essential E3 ubiquitin ligase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is known to ubiquitinate plasma membrane permeases followed by endocytosis and vacuolar degradation. We previously isolated the rsp5 mutant that is hypersensitive to various stresses, suggesting that Rsp5 is involved in degradation of stress-induced abnormal proteins. Here, we analyzed the ability to refold the proteins by stress proteins in the rsp5 mutant. The transcription of stress protein genes in the rsp5 mutant was significantly lower than that in the wild-type strain when exposed to temperature up-shift, ethanol or sorbitol. Interestingly, the amounts of transcription factors Hsf1 and Msn4 were remarkably defective in the rsp5 mutant. These results suggest that expression of stress proteins are mediated by Rsp5 and that Rsp5 primarily regulates post-translational modification of Hsf1 and Msn4.

Genetic analysis of synaptotagmin 2 in spontaneous and Ca2+-triggered
neurotransmitter release.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Synaptotagmin 2 resembles synaptotagmin 1, the Ca2+ sensor for fast neurotransmitter release in forebrain synapses, but little is known about synaptotagmin 2 function. Here, we describe a severely ataxic mouse strain that harbors a single, destabilizing amino-acid substitution (I377N) in synaptotagmin 2. In Calyx of Held synapses, this mutation causes a delay and a decrease in Ca2+-induced but not in hypertonic sucrose-induced release, suggesting that synaptotagmin 2 mediates Ca2+ triggering of evoked release in brainstem synapses. Unexpectedly, we additionally observed in synaptotagmin 2 mutant synapses a dramatic increase in spontaneous release. Synaptotagmin 1-deficient excitatory and inhibitory cortical synapses also displayed a large increase in spontaneous release, demonstrating that this effect was shared among synaptotagmins 1 and 2. Our data suggest that synaptotagmin 1 and 2 perform equivalent functions in the Ca2+ triggering of action potential-induced release and in the restriction of spontaneous release, consistent with a general role of synaptotagmins in controlling 'release slots' for synaptic vesicles at the active zone.

Regulation of tight junctions during the epithelium-mesenchyme transition:
direct repression of the gene expression of claudins/occludin by Snail.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Snail is a transcription repressor that plays a central role in the epithelium-mesenchyme transition (EMT), by which epithelial cells lose their polarity. Claudins and occludin are integral membrane proteins localized at tight junctions, which are responsible for establishing and maintaining epithelial cell polarity. We examined the relationship between Snail and the promoter activity of claudins and occludin. When Snail was overexpressed in cultured mouse epithelial cells, EMT was induced with concomitant repression of the expression of claudins and occludin not only at the protein but also at the mRNA level. We then isolated the promoters of genes encoding claudins and occludin, in which multiple E-boxes were identified. Transfection experiments with various promoter constructs as well as electrophoretic mobility assays revealed that Snail binds directly to the E-boxes of the promoters of claudin/occludin genes, resulting in complete repression of their promoter activity. Because the gene encoding E-cadherin was also reported to be repressed by Snail, we concluded that EMT was associated with the simultaneous repression of the genes encoding E-cadherin and claudins/occludin (i.e. the expression of adherens and tight junction adhesion molecules, respectively).

remodeling of nucleosomes.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Remodeling machines play an essential role in the control of gene expression, but how their activity is regulated is not known. Here we report that the nuclear protein nucleolin possesses a histone chaperone activity and that this factor greatly enhances the activity of the chromatin remodeling machineries SWI/SNF and ACF. Interestingly, nucleolin is able to induce the remodeling by SWI/SNF of macroH2A, but not of H2ABbd nucleosomes, which are otherwise resistant to remodeling. This new histone chaperone promotes the destabilization of the histone octamer, helping the dissociation of a H2A-H2B dimer, and stimulates the SWI/SNF-mediated transfer of H2A-H2B dimers. Furthermore, nucleolin facilitates transcription through the nucleosome, which is reminiscent of the activity of the FACT complex. This work defines new functions for histone chaperones in chromatin remodeling and regulation of transcription and explains how nucleolin could act on transcription.

Mouse profilin 2 regulates endocytosis and competes with SH3 ligand
binding to dynamin 1.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Mammalian profilins are abundantly expressed actin monomer-binding proteins, highly conserved with respect to their affinities for G-actin, poly-L-proline, and phosphoinositides. Profilins associate with a large number of proline-rich proteins; the physiological significance and regulation of which is poorly understood. Here we show that profilin 2 associates with dynamin 1 via the C-terminal proline-rich domain of dynamin and thereby competes with the binding of SH3 ligands such as endophilin, amphiphysin, and Grb2, thus interfering with the assembly of the endocytic machinery. We also present a novel role for the brain-specific mouse profilin 2 as a regulator of membrane trafficking. Overexpression of profilin 2 inhibits endocytosis, whereas lack of profilin 2 in neurons results in an increase in endocytosis and membrane recycling. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate releases profilin 2 from the profilin 2-dynamin 1 complex as well as from the profilin 2-actin complex, suggesting that profilin 2 is diverging the phosphoinositide signaling pathway to actin polymerization as well as endocytosis.

Direct comparison of a stable isolated Hsp70 substrate-binding domain in
the empty and substrate-bound states.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones acts to prevent protein misfolding, import proteins into organelles, unravel protein aggregates, and enhance cell survival under stress conditions. These activities are all mediated by recognition of diverse hydrophobic sequences via a C-terminal substrate-binding domain. ATP-binding/hydrolysis by the N-terminal ATPase domain regulates the interconversion of the substrate-binding domain between low and high affinity conformations. The empty state of the substrate-binding domain has been difficult to study because of its propensity to bind nearly any available protein chain, even if only modestly hydrophobic. We have generated a new stable construct of the substrate-binding domain from the Escherichia coli Hsp70, DnaK, which has enabled us to compare the empty and peptide-bound conformations using NMR chemical shift analysis and hydrogen-deuterium exchange. We have determined that the empty state is, overall, quite similar to the peptide-bound state, contrary to a previous report. Peptide binding leads to a subtle alteration in the packing of the alpha-helical lid relative to the beta-subdomain. Significantly, we have shown that the chemical shifts of the substrate-binding domain and the ATPase domain do not change when they are placed together in a two-domain construct, whether or not peptide is bound, suggesting that, in the absence of nucleotide, the two domains of E. coli DnaK do not interact. We conclude that the isolated substrate-binding domain exists in a stable high affinity state in the absence of influence from a nucleotide-bound ATPase domain.

<ABSTRACT>
The bacterial ArsA ATPase is the catalytic component of an oxyanion pump that is responsible for resistance to arsenicals and antimonials. Homologues of the bacterial ArsA ATPase are widespread in nature. We had earlier identified the mouse homologue (Asna1) that exhibits 27% identity to the bacterial ArsA ATPase. To identify the physiological role of the protein, heterozygous Asna1 knockout mice (Asna1+/-) were generated by homologous recombination. The Asna1+/- mice displayed similar phenotype as the wild-type mice. However, early embryonic lethality was observed in homozygous Asna1 knockout embryos, between E3.5 (E=embryonic day) and E8.5 stage. These findings indicate that Asna1 plays a crucial role during early embryonic development.

Significance of sterol structural specificity. Desmosterol cannot replace
cholesterol in lipid rafts.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Desmosterol is an immediate precursor of cholesterol in the Bloch pathway of sterol synthesis and an abundant membrane lipid in specific cell types. The significance of the difference between the two sterols, an additional double bond at position C24 in the tail of desmosterol, is not known. Here, we provide evidence that the biophysical and functional characteristics of the two sterols differ and that this is because the double bond at C24 significantly weakens the sterol ordering potential. In model membranes, desmosterol was significantly weaker than cholesterol in promoting the formation or stability of ordered domains, and in mammalian cell membranes, desmosterol associated less avidly than cholesterol with detergent-resistant membranes. Atomic scale molecular dynamics simulations showed that the double bond gives rise to additional stress in the tail, creating a rigid structure between C24 and C27 and favoring tilting of desmosterol distinct from cholesterol. Functional effects of desmosterol in cell membranes were assessed upon acutely exchanging approximately 70% of cholesterol to desmosterol. This led to impaired raft-dependent signaling via the insulin receptor, whereas non-raft-dependent protein secretion was not affected. We suggest that the choice of cholesterol synthesis route may provide a physiological mechanism to modulate raft-dependent functions in cells.

Role of transmembrane segment 10 in efflux mediated by the staphylococcal
multidrug transport protein QacA.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The staphylococcal multidrug exporter QacA confers resistance to a wide range of structurally dissimilar monovalent and bivalent cationic antimicrobial compounds. To understand the functional importance of transmembrane segment 10, which is thought to be involved in substrate binding, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis was performed in which 35 amino acid residues in the putative transmembrane helix and its flanking regions were replaced in turn with cysteine. Solvent accessibility analysis of the introduced cysteine residues using fluorescein maleimide indicated that transmembrane segment 10 of QacA contains a 20-amino-acid hydrophobic core and may extend from Pro-309 to Ala-334. Phenotypic analysis and fluorimetric transport assays of these mutants showed that Gly-313 is important for the efflux of both monovalent and bivalent cationic substrates, whereas Asp-323 is only important for the efflux of bivalent substrates and probably forms part of the bivalent substrate-binding site(s) together with Met-319. Furthermore, the effects of N-ethyl-maleimide treatment on ethidium and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole export mediated by the QacA mutants suggest that the face of transmembrane segment 10 that contains Asp-323 may also be close to the monovalent substrate-binding site(s), making this helix an integral component of the QacA multidrug-binding pocket.

Previous reports have shown that metallothionein (MT) may modulate p53 activity through zinc exchange. However, little is known on a direct interaction between MT and p53 in cells. The results demonstrate an interaction between MT and p53 can occur in vitro. The complex between MT and p53 was observed in breast cancer epithelial cells with both wild and inactive type of p53. Furthermore, it was shown that wt-p53 was preferentially associated with Apo-MT. Our data suggest that co-expression of MT and p53 and their complex formation in tumor cells may be involved in regulation of apoptosis in these cells.

Histone demethylation by a family of JmjC domain-containing proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Covalent modification of histones has an important role in regulating chromatin dynamics and transcription. Whereas most covalent histone modifications are reversible, until recently it was unknown whether methyl groups could be actively removed from histones. Using a biochemical assay coupled with chromatography, we have purified a novel JmjC domain-containing protein, JHDM1 (JmjC domain-containing histone demethylase 1), that specifically demethylates histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3-K36). In the presence of Fe(ii) and alpha-ketoglutarate, JHDM1 demethylates H3-methyl-K36 and generates formaldehyde and succinate. Overexpression of JHDM1 reduced the level of dimethyl-H3-K36 (H3K36me2) in vivo. The demethylase activity of the JmjC domain-containing proteins is conserved, as a JHDM1 homologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae also has H3-K36 demethylase activity. Thus, we identify the JmjC domain as a novel demethylase signature motif and uncover a protein demethylation mechanism that is conserved from yeast to human.

<ABSTRACT>
Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is crucial for the generation of multiple lymphocyte subsets (natural killer (NK), NK-T cells, and memory CD8 T cells), and transpresentation of IL-15 by monocytes and dendritic cells has been suggested to be the dominant activating process of these lymphocytes. We have previously shown that a natural soluble form of IL-15R alpha chain corresponding to the entire extracellular domain of IL-15R alpha behaves as a high affinity IL-15 antagonist. In sharp contrast with this finding, we demonstrate in this report that a recombinant, soluble sushi domain of IL-15R alpha, which bears most of the binding affinity for IL-15, behaves as a potent IL-15 agonist by enhancing its binding and biological effects (proliferation and protection from apoptosis) through the IL-15R beta/gamma heterodimer, whereas it does not affect IL-15 binding and function of the tripartite IL-15R alpha/beta/gamma membrane receptor. Our results suggest that, if naturally produced, such soluble sushi domains might be involved in the IL-15 transpresentation mechanism. Fusion proteins (RLI and ILR), in which IL-15 and IL-15R alpha-sushi are attached by a flexible linker, are even more potent than the combination of IL-15 plus sIL-15R alpha-sushi. After binding to IL-15R beta/gamma, RLI is internalized and induces a biological response very similar to the IL-15 high affinity response. Such hyper-IL-15 fusion proteins appear to constitute potent adjuvants for the expansion of lymphocyte subsets.

Variation in mannose-capped terminal arabinan motifs of lipoarabinomannans

<ABSTRACT>
The unique terminal arabinan motifs of mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM), which are mannose-capped to different extents, probably constitute the single most important structural entity engaged in receptor binding and subsequent immunopathogenesis. We have developed a concerted approach of endoarabinanase digestion coupled with chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis to rapidly identify and quantitatively map the complement of such terminal units among the clinical isolates of different virulence and drug resistance profiles. In comparison with LAM from laboratory strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an ethambutol (Emb) resistant clinical isolate was shown to have a significantly higher proportion of nonmannose capped arabinan termini. More drastically, the mannose capping was completely inhibited when an Emb-susceptible strain was grown in the presence of subminimal inhibitory concentration of Emb. Both cases resulted in an increase of arabinose to mannose ratio in the overall glycosyl composition of LAM. Emb, therefore, not only could affect the complete elaboration of the arabinan as found previously for LAM from Mycobacterium smegmatis resistant mutant but also could inhibit the extent of mannose capping and hence its associated biological functions in M. tuberculosis. Unexpectedly, an intrinsically Emb-resistant Mycobacterium avium isolate of smooth transparent colony morphology was found to have most of its arabinan termini capped with a single mannose residue instead of the more common dimannoside as established for LAM from M. tuberculosis. This is the first report on the LAM structure from M. avium complex, an increasingly important opportunistic infectious agent afflicting AIDS patients.

<ABSTRACT>
ROCK or Rho-associated kinase, a serine/threonine kinase, is an effector of Rho-dependent signaling and is involved in actin-cytoskeleton assembly and cell motility and contraction. The ROCK protein consists of several domains: an N-terminal region, a kinase catalytic domain, a coiled-coil domain containing a RhoA binding site, and a pleckstrin homology domain. The C-terminal region of ROCK binds to and inhibits the kinase catalytic domains, and this inhibition is reversed by binding RhoA, a small GTPase. Here we present the structure of the N-terminal region and the kinase domain. In our structure, two N-terminal regions interact to form a dimerization domain linking two kinase domains together. This spatial arrangement presents the kinase active sites and regulatory sequences on a common face affording the possibility of both kinases simultaneously interacting with a dimeric inhibitory domain or with a dimeric substrate. The kinase domain adopts a catalytically competent conformation; however, no phosphorylation of active site residues is observed in the structure. We also determined the structures of ROCK bound to four different ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitors (Y-27632, fasudil, hydroxyfasudil, and H-1152P). Each of these compounds binds with reduced affinity to cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA), a highly homologous kinase. Subtle differences exist between the ROCK- and PKA-bound conformations of the inhibitors that suggest that interactions with a single amino acid of the active site (Ala215 in ROCK and Thr183 in PKA) determine the relative selectivity of these compounds. Hydroxyfasudil, a metabolite of fasudil, may be selective for ROCK over PKA through a reversed binding orientation.

<ABSTRACT>
We previously identified two forms of endocytosis using capacitance measurements in chromaffin cells: rapid endocytosis (RE), dynamin-1 dependent but clathrin-independent and slow endocytosis (SE), dynamin-2 and clathrin-dependent. Various recombinant SH3 domains that interact with the proline-rich domain of dynamin were introduced into single cells via the patch pipette. GST-SH3 domains of amphiphysin-1, intersectin-IC, and endophilin-I inhibited SE but had no effect on RE. Grb2-SH3 (N-terminal) or a mutant of amphiphysin-1-SH3 was inactive on either process. These data confirm that dynamin-1 dependent RE is independent of clathrin and show that amphiphysin is exclusively associated with clathrin and dynamin-2-dependent SE.

<ABSTRACT>
Histone deacetylase (HDAC)-6 was recently identified as a dual substrate, possibly multisubstrate, deacetylase that can act both on acetylated histone tails and on alpha-tubulin acetylated on Lys40. HDAC-6 is unique among deacetylases in having two hdac domains, and we have used this enzyme as a useful model to dissect the structural requirements for the deacetylation reaction. In this report, we show that both hdac domains are required for the intact deacetylase activity of HDAC-6 in vitro and in vivo. The spatial arrangement of these two domains in HDAC-6 is essential and alteration of the linker region between the two domains severely affects the catalytic activity. Artificial chimeric HDACs, made by replacing the hdac domains in HDAC-6 with corresponding domains from other class II HDACs, show de novo deacetylase activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that the spatial arrangement of hdac domains is critical for in vivo deacetylation reaction and may provide a useful model for the development of novel HDAC inhibitors.

In the crystal structure of the native GroEL.GroES.substrate protein complex from Thermus thermophilus, one GroEL subunit makes contact with two GroES subunits. One contact is through the H-I helices, and the other is through a novel GXXLE region. The side chain of Leu, in the GXXLE region, forms a hydrophobic cluster with residues of the H helix (Shimamura, T., Koike-Takeshita, A., Yokoyama, K., Masui, R., Murai, N., Yoshida, M., Taguchi, H., and Iwata, S.

The results are as follows: (i) cross-linking between introduced cysteines confirmed that the GXXLE region in the E. coli GroEL.GroES complex is also in contact with GroES; (ii) when Leu was replaced by Lys (GroEL(L309K)) or other charged residues, chaperone activity was largely lost; (iii) the GroEL(L309K).substrate complex failed to bind GroES to produce a stable GroEL(L309K).GroES.substrate complex, whereas free GroEL(L309K) bound GroES normally; (iv) the GroEL(L309K).GroES.substrate complex was stabilized with BeF(x), but the substrate protein in the complex was readily digested by protease, indicating that it was not properly encapsulated into the internal cavity of the complex. Thus, conformational communication between the two GroES contact sites, the H helix and the GXXLE region (through Leu(309)), appears to play a critical role in encapsulation of the substrate.

Recruitment of scribble to the synaptic scaffolding complex requires
GUK-holder, a novel DLG binding protein.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
BACKGROUND: Membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs), such as Discs-Large (DLG), play critical roles in synapse maturation by regulating the assembly of synaptic multiprotein complexes. Previous studies have revealed a genetic interaction between DLG and another PDZ scaffolding protein, SCRIBBLE (SCRIB), during the establishment of cell polarity in developing epithelia. A possible interaction between DLG and SCRIB at synaptic junctions has not yet been addressed. Likewise, the biochemical nature of this interaction remains elusive, raising questions regarding the mechanisms by which the actions of both proteins are coordinated. RESULTS: Here we report the isolation of a new DLG-interacting protein, GUK-holder, that interacts with the GUK domain of DLG and which is dynamically expressed during synaptic bouton budding. We also show that at Drosophila synapses DLG colocalizes with SCRIB and that this colocalization is likely to be mediated by direct interactions between GUKH and the PDZ2 domain of SCRIB. We show that DLG, GUKH, and SCRIB form a tripartite complex at synapses, in which DLG and GUKH are required for the proper synaptic localization of SCRIB. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a mechanism by which developmentally important PDZ-mediated complexes are associated at the synapse.

Binding of manumycin A inhibits IkappaB kinase beta activity.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
IkappaB kinase (IKK) catalytic subunits play a key role in cytokinemediated nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling, and a loss of NF-kappaB function appears to inhibit inflammation and oncogenesis. Manumycin A is a potent and selective farnesyltransferase inhibitor with antitumor activity. We found that manumycin A caused a rapid and potent inhibition of IKK activity induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha in a number of cell types. Most unexpectedly, other classes of farnesyltransferase inhibitors had no inhibitory effect. To identify the molecular mechanisms of manumycin A action, cultured human HepG2 hepatoma cells were transiently transfected with various IKKalpha and IKKbeta constructs, and a striking difference in manumycin A sensitivity was observed. Furthermore, cells expressing wild-type IKKbeta and IKKbeta mutated in the activation loop at Cys-179 exhibited covalent homotypic dimerization of IKKbeta in response to manumycin A, whereas substitution of Cys-662 and -716 conferred protection against dimer formation. Direct inhibition of IKK activity and formation of stable IKKbeta dimers were observed in the presence of manumycin A that could be blocked by dithiothreitol. IKK interaction with the adaptor protein IKKgamma/NEMO was disrupted in manumycin A-treated cells. Most importantly, administration of manumycin A to mice xenografted with murine B16F10 tumors caused potent IKK-suppressive effects. Thus, manumycin A with its epoxyquinoid moieties plays an important regulatory function in IKK signaling through pathways distinct from its role as a protein farnesylation inhibitor.

<ABSTRACT>
The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) can bind to and activate fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). However, there are four major FGFR isoforms (FGFR1-FGFR4), and it is not known whether NCAM also interacts directly with the other three FGFR isoforms. In this study, we show by surface plasmon resonance analysis that NCAM can bind to FGFR2 with an affinity similar to that for the NCAM-FGFR1 interaction. However, the kinetic parameters for the NCAM-FGFR2 binding are different from those of the NCAM-FGFR1 binding. Both receptors were shown to cycle relatively fast between the NCAM bound and unbound states, although FGFR2 cycling was clearly faster (13 times) than the FGFR1 cycling. Moreover, ATP was more effective in inhibiting the binding of NCAM to FGFR1 than to FGFR2, indicating that the binding sites in NCAM for the two receptors are similar, but not identical.

<ABSTRACT>
The chemokine MCP-1 is thought to play a key role - among many other pathophysiological processes - in myocardial infarction. MCP-1 is not only a key attractant for monocytes and macrophages and as such responsible for inflammation but might also be directly involved in the modulation of repair processes in the heart. We show that cultured human cardiac cells express MCP-1 and that its expression is upregulated by inflammatory cytokines and downregulated by hypoxia. We hypothesize that inflammation but not hypoxia is the main trigger for monocyte recruitment in the human heart.

Insulin enhances growth hormone induction of the MEK/ERK signaling
pathway.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Growth hormone (GH) plays an important role in growth and metabolism by signaling via at least three major pathways, including STATs, ERK1/2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt. Physiological concentrations of insulin promote growth probably by modulating liver GH receptor (GHR) levels in vivo, but the possible effects of insulin on GH-induced post-GHR signaling have yet to be studied. We hypothesized that short-term insulin, similar to the fluctuations that occur following feeding, affects GH-induced post-GHR signaling. Our present studies suggest that, in rat H4IIE hepatoma cells, insulin (4 h or less) selectively enhanced GH-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, but not GH-induced activation of STAT5 and Akt. Although insulin pretreatment altered GH-induced formation of Shc.Grb2.SOS complex, it did not significantly affect GH-induced activation of other signaling intermediates upstream of MEK/ERK, including JAK2, Ras, and Raf-1. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that insulin pretreatment facilitated GH-induced cell membrane translocation of MEK1/2. Insulin pretreatment also increased the amount of MEK association with its scaffolding protein, KSR. In summary, short-term insulin treatment of cultured, liver-derived cells selectively sensitized GH-induced MEK/ERK phosphorylation independent of JAK2, Ras, and Raf-1, but likely resulted from increased cell membrane translocation of MEK1/2. These findings suggest that insulin may be necessary for sensitization of cells to GH-induced ERK1/2 activation and provides a potential cellular mechanism by which insulin promotes growth.

Competition between Sec- and TAT-dependent protein translocation in
Escherichia coli.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Recently, a new protein translocation pathway, the twin-arginine translocation (TAT) pathway, has been identified in both bacteria and chloroplasts. To study the possible competition between the TAT- and the well-characterized Sec translocon-dependent pathways in Escherichia coli, we have fused the TorA TAT-targeting signal peptide to the Sec-dependent inner membrane protein leader peptidase (Lep). We find that the soluble, periplasmic P2 domain from Lep is re-routed by the TorA signal peptide into the TAT pathway. In contrast, the full-length TorA-Lep fusion protein is not re-routed into the TAT pathway, suggesting that Sec-targeting signals in Lep can override TAT-targeting information in the TorA signal peptide. We also show that the TorA signal peptide can be converted into a Sec-targeting signal peptide by increasing the hydrophobicity of its h-region. Thus, beyond the twin-arginine motif, the overall hydrophobicity of the signal peptide plays an important role in TAT versus Sec targeting. This is consistent with statistical data showing that TAT-targeting signal peptides in general have less hydrophobic h-regions than Sec-targeting signal peptides.

A role for Kif17 in transport of Kv4.2.
</TITLE>

NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Although kinesins are known to transport neuronal proteins, it is not known what role they play in the targeting of their cargos to specific subcellular compartments in neurons. Here we present evidence that the K+ channel Kv4.2, which is a major regulator of dendritic excitability, is transported to dendrites by the kinesin isoform Kif17. We show that a dominant negative construct against Kif17 dramatically inhibits localization to dendrites of both introduced and endogenous Kv4.2, but those against other kinesins found in dendrites do not. Kv4.2 colocalizes with Kif17 but not with other kinesin isoforms in dendrites of cortical neurons. Native Kv4.2 and Kif17 coimmunoprecipitate from brain lysate, and introduced, tagged versions of the two proteins coimmunoprecipitate from COS cell lysate, indicating that the two proteins interact, either directly or indirectly. The interaction between Kif17 and Kv4.2 appears to occur through the extreme C terminus of Kv4.2 and not through the dileucine motif. Thus, the dileucine motif does not determine the localization of Kv4.2 by causing the channel to interact with a specific motor protein. In support of this conclusion, we found that the dileucine motif mediates dendritic targeting of CD8 independent of Kif17. Together our data show that Kif17 is probably the motor that transports Kv4.2 to dendrites but suggest that this motor does not, by itself, specify dendritic localization of the channel.

<ABSTRACT>
The enzyme responsible for iodide salvage in the thyroid, iodotyrosine deiodinase, was solubilized from porcine thyroid microsomes by limited proteolysis with trypsin. The resulting protein retained deiodinase activity and was purified using anion exchange, dye, and hydrophobic chromatography successively. Peptide sequencing of the final isolate identified the gene responsible for the deiodinase. The amino acid sequence of the porcine enzyme is highly homologous to corresponding genes in a variety of mammals including humans, and the mouse gene was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells to confirm its identity. The amino acid sequence of the deiodinase suggests the presence of three domains. The N-terminal domain provides a membrane anchor. The intermediate domain contains the highest sequence variability and lacks homology to structural motifs available in the common databases. The C-terminal domain is highly conserved and resembles bacterial enzymes of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase superfamily. A three-dimensional model of the deiodinase based on the coordinates of the minor nitroreductase of Escherichia coli indicates that a Cys common to all of the mammal sequences is located adjacent to bound FMN. However, the deiodinase is not structurally related to other known flavoproteins containing redox-active cysteines or the iodothyronine deiodinases containing an active site selenocysteine.

Siah1 interacts with the scaffold protein POSH to promote JNK activation

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Siah proteins are ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases (E3) that have been implicated in a variety of cellular actions, including promotion of apoptotic death. Here, we show that Siah1 is a binding partner for POSH (plenty of SH3s), a scaffold component of the apoptotic JNK pathway, and that Siah contributes to death of neurons and other cell types by activating the JNK pathway. Such proapoptotic activity requires the E3 ligase activity of Siah1. Moreover, apoptotic stimuli markedly elevate cellular Siah1 levels by a mechanism reliant on Siah1 protein stabilization. This stabilization requires JNK pathway activation and interaction with POSH and is enhanced by phosphorylation of SIAH1 at tyrosines 100 and 126. Depletion of intracellular Siah proteins via small interference RNA partially protects cells from death evoked by apoptotic stimuli such as trophic factor deprivation and DNA damage. These findings thus reveal a "loop" mechanism in which the JNK pathway promotes SIAH1 stabilization and in which SIAH1 in turn activates the JNK pathway and, ultimately, contributes to cell death.

Gfi1b alters histone methylation at target gene promoters and sites of

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Gfi1b is a 37 kDa nuclear protein with six C2H2 zinc-finger domains that can silence transcription upon binding to specific target gene promoters. Here we show by using a chromatin immunoprecipitation and cloning protocol that Gfi1b also binds to gamma-satellite sequences that mainly occur in pericentric heterochromatin. Immuno-FISH experiments demonstrated that Gfi1b is localized at foci of pericentric heterochromatin identified by DAPI staining. Elevated levels of Gfi1b correlated with increased histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation at sites neighboring gamma-satellite sequences but also at Gfi1b target gene promoters. In Gfi1b-deficient cells, however, a decrease of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation and a loss of heterochromatic structures was observed. Strikingly, we found that Gfi1b binds to both SUV39H1 and G9A histone methyl transferases, which provides a direct link between histone methylation and Gfi1b at heterochromatic and euchromatic sites. We propose that Gfi1b functions in heterochromatin formation and silencing of euchromatic transcription by recruiting histone methyl transferases to either gamma-satellite sequences or specific target gene promoters.

<ABSTRACT>
Alzheimer disease-linked Presenilin-1 (PS1) is a negative modulator of beta-catenin/Tcf-4 activity. However, the mechanism underlying this effect is not well understood. We show here that the effects of PS1 on the activity of this complex in epithelial cells are independent of its gamma-secretase activity and its interaction with beta-catenin. As presented in this report PS1 also binds plakoglobin with similar affinity as beta-catenin, although this interaction does not involve equivalent residues in the two catenins. Moreover, PS1 association with plakoglobin enhances the interaction of this molecule with Tcf-4 and prevents its binding to DNA. These effects were observed with the unprocessed form of PS1, which has higher affinity for plakoglobin and beta-catenin than processed PS1. These results provide a new explanation for the effects of PS1 on gene transcription mediated by beta-catenin in epithelial cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Tomato Cf-9, a receptor-like protein (RLP), confers resistance to races of the fungal pathogen Cladosporium fulvum that express the Avr9 avirulence gene. CITRX (Cf-9-interacting thioredoxin) was previously identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a protein interacting with the cytoplasmic domain of Cf-9 and shown to be a negative regulator of the cell death induced after Cf-9/Avr9 interaction. ACIK1 is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that is specifically required for the Cf-9 and Cf-4 dependent defence response in tomato. In this paper we present data suggesting that CITRX may act as an adaptor recruiting the ACIK1 kinase to the cytoplasmic domain of Cf-9 upon elicitation with the Avr9 peptide. Interestingly, the catalytic activities of both CITRX and ACIK1 are not required for their interaction.

Flies without centrioles.

<ABSTRACT>
Centrioles and centrosomes have an important role in animal cell organization, but it is uncertain to what extent they are essential for animal development. The Drosophila protein DSas-4 is related to the human microcephaly protein CenpJ and the C. elegans centriolar protein Sas-4. We show that DSas-4 is essential for centriole replication in flies. DSas-4 mutants start to lose centrioles during embryonic development, and, by third-instar larval stages, no centrioles or centrosomes are detectable. Mitotic spindle assembly is slow in mutant cells, and approximately 30% of the asymmetric divisions of larval neuroblasts are abnormal. Nevertheless, mutant flies develop with near normal timing into morphologically normal adults. These flies, however, have no cilia or flagella and die shortly after birth because their sensory neurons lack cilia. Thus, centrioles are essential for the formation of centrosomes, cilia, and flagella, but, remarkably, they are not essential for most aspects of Drosophila development.

<ABSTRACT>
The HMGA1a protein belongs to the high mobility group A (HMGA) family of architectural nuclear factors, a group of proteins that plays an important role in chromatin dynamics. HMGA proteins are multifunctional factors that associate both with DNA and nuclear proteins that have been involved in several nuclear processes, such as transcriptional regulation, viral integration, DNA repair, RNA processing, and chromatin remodeling. The activity of HMGA proteins is finely modulated by a variety of post-translational modifications. Arginine methylation was recently demonstrated to occur on HMGA1a protein, and it correlates with the apoptotic process and neoplastic progression. Methyltransferases responsible for these modifications are unknown. Here we show that the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT6 specifically methylates HMGA1a protein both in vitro and in vivo. By mass spectrometry, the sites of methylation were unambiguously mapped to Arg(57) and Arg(59), two residues which are embedded in the second AT-hook, a region critical for both protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions and whose modification may cause profound alterations in the HMGA network. The in vivo association of HMGA and PRMT6 place this yet functionally uncharacterized methyltransferase in the well established functional context of the chromatin structure organization.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family has important roles in microbial recognition and dendritic cell activation. TLRs 7 and 9 can recognize nucleic acids and trigger signalling cascades that activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells to produce interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) (refs 7, 8). TLR7/9-mediated dendritic cell activation is critical for antiviral immunity but also contributes to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease in which serum IFN-alpha levels are elevated owing to plasmacytoid dendritic cell activation. TLR7/9-induced IFN-alpha induction depends on a molecular complex that contains a TLR adaptor, MyD88, and IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) (refs 10-14), but the underlying molecular mechanisms are as yet unknown. Here we show that IkappaB kinase-alpha (IKK-alpha) is critically involved in TLR7/9-induced IFN-alpha production. TLR7/9-induced IFN-alpha production was severely impaired in IKK-alpha-deficient plasmacytoid dendritic cells, whereas inflammatory cytokine induction was decreased but still occurred. Kinase-deficient IKK-alpha inhibited the ability of MyD88 to activate the Ifna promoter in synergy with IRF-7. Furthermore, IKK-alpha associated with and phosphorylated IRF-7. Our results identify a role for IKK-alpha in TLR7/9 signalling, and highlight IKK-alpha as a potential target for manipulating TLR-induced IFN-alpha production.

<ABSTRACT>
The establishment and maintenance of epigenetic gene silencing is fundamental to cell determination and function. The essential epigenetic systems involved in heritable repression of gene activity are the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins and the DNA methylation systems. Here we show that the corresponding silencing pathways are mechanistically linked. We find that the PcG protein EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2) interacts-within the context of the Polycomb repressive complexes 2 and 3 (PRC2/3)-with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and associates with DNMT activity in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitations indicate that binding of DNMTs to several EZH2-repressed genes depends on the presence of EZH2. Furthermore, we show by bisulphite genomic sequencing that EZH2 is required for DNA methylation of EZH2-target promoters. Our results suggest that EZH2 serves as a recruitment platform for DNA methyltransferases, thus highlighting a previously unrecognized direct connection between two key epigenetic repression systems.

Charge modification at multiple C-terminal lysine residues regulates p53
oligomerization and its nucleus-cytoplasm trafficking.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The basal level of the tumor suppressor p53 is regulated by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination at specific lysines, which leads to p53 nuclear export and degradation. Upon p53 activation, however, these lysines become acetylated by p300/CREB-binding protein. Here we have reported an unexpected finding that p300-mediated acetylation also regulates p53 subcellular localization and can promote cytoplasmic localization of p53. This activity is independent of MDM2 but requires a p53 nuclear export signal and acetylation of multiple lysines by p300. Mechanistically, we showed that conversion of a minimal four of these lysines to alanines but not arginines mimics p300-mediated p53 nuclear export, and these lysine-neutralizing mutations effectively prevent p53 tetramerization, thus exposing the oligomerization-regulated nuclear export signal. Our study suggested a threshold mechanism whereby the degree of acetylation regulates p53 nucleus-cytoplasm trafficking by neutralizing a lysine-dependent charge patch, which in turn, controls oligomerization-dependent p53 nuclear export.

5'-cytosine with glutamine 148 of the HIV-1 integrase flexible loop.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Integration is essential for retroviral replication and gene therapy using retroviral vectors. Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), integrase specifically recognizes the terminal sequences of each long terminal repeat (LTR) and cleaves the 3'-end terminal dinucleotide 5'-GT. The exposed 3'-hydroxyl is then positioned for nucleophilic attack and subsequent strand transfer into another DNA duplex (target or chromosomal DNA). We report that both the terminal cytosine at the protruding 5'-end of the long terminal repeats (5'-C) and the integrase residue Gln-148 are critical for strand transfer. Proximity of the 5'-C and Gln-148 was demonstrated by disulfide cross-linking. Cross-linking is inhibited by the inhibitor 5CITEP 1-(5-chloroindol-3-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-propenone. We propose that strand transfer requires a conformational change of the integrase-viral (donor) DNA complex with formation of an H-bond between the N-3 of the 5'-C and the amine group of Gln-148. These findings have implications for the molecular mechanisms coupling 3'-processing and strand transfer as well as for the molecular pharmacology of integrase inhibitors.

<ABSTRACT>
WHITE COLLAR-1 (WC-1) is the limiting component of the White Collar Complex (WCC) controlling expression of the Neurospora circadian clock protein Frequency (FRQ). Accumulation of WC-1 is supported by FRQ on a post-transcriptional level. Here, we show that transcription of wc-1 is organized in a complex way. Three promoters drive transcription of wc-1. Pdist is dependent on WCC. Pprox is independent of WCC in darkness, but inducible by light in a WCC-dependent manner. A third promoter, Pint, is located in the wc-1 open reading frame and promotes expression of an amino-terminally truncated WC-1 isoform of unknown function. Expression of wc-1 by Pdist or Pprox alone, or by a heterologous promoter, affects the entrained phase of circadian conidiation and the response of Neurospora to light. Our results indicate that transcriptional regulation of wc-1 is required to modulate the circadian phase of clock output.

Effects of stable suppression of Group VIA phospholipase A2 expression on

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Studies involving pharmacologic inhibition or transient reduction of Group VIA phospholipase A2 (iPLA2beta) expression have suggested that it is a housekeeping enzyme that regulates cell 2-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) levels, rates of arachidonate incorporation into phospholipids, and degradation of excess phosphatidylcholine (PC). In insulin-secreting islet beta-cells and some other cells, in contrast, iPLA2beta signaling functions have been proposed. Using retroviral vectors, we prepared clonal INS-1 beta-cell lines in which iPLA2beta expression is stably suppressed by small interfering RNA. Two such iPLA2beta knockdown (iPLA2beta-KD) cell lines express less than 20% of the iPLA2beta of control INS-1 cell lines. The iPLA2beta-KD INS-1 cells exhibit impaired insulin secretory responses and reduced proliferation rates. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analyses of PC and LPC species that accumulate in INS-1 cells cultured with arachidonic acid suggest that 18:0/20:4-glycerophosphocholine (GPC) synthesis involves sn-2 remodeling to yield 16:0/20:4-GPC and then sn-1 remodeling via a 1-lyso/20:4-GPC intermediate. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analyses also indicate that the PC and LPC content and composition of iPLA2beta-KD and control INS-1 cells are nearly identical, as are the rates of arachidonate incorporation into PC and the composition and remodeling of other phospholipid classes. These findings indicate that iPLA2beta plays signaling or effector roles in beta-cell secretion and proliferation but that stable suppression of its expression does not affect beta-cell GPC lipid content or composition even under conditions in which LPC is being actively consumed by conversion to PC. This calls into question the generality of proposed housekeeping functions for iPLA2beta in PC homeostasis and remodeling.

UBP43 is a novel regulator of interferon signaling independent of its

<ABSTRACT>
Interferons (IFNs) regulate diverse cellular functions through activation of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. Lack of Ubp43, an IFN-inducible ISG15 deconjugating enzyme, leads to IFN hypersensitivity in ubp43-/- mice, suggesting an important function of Ubp43 in downregulation of IFN responses. Here, we show that Ubp43 negatively regulates IFN signaling independent of its isopeptidase activity towards ISG15. Ubp43 functions specifically for type I IFN signaling by downregulating the JAK-STAT pathway at the level of the IFN receptor. Using molecular, biochemical, and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that Ubp43 specifically binds to the IFNAR2 receptor subunit and inhibits the activity of receptor-associated JAK1 by blocking the interaction between JAK and the IFN receptor. These data implicate Ubp43 as a novel in vivo inhibitor of signal transduction pathways that are specifically triggered by type I IFN.

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteases of Candida albicans target

interactions.

<ABSTRACT>
Intracellular and secreted proteases fulfill multiple functions in microorganisms. In pathogenic microorganisms extracellular proteases may be adapted to interactions with host cells. Here we describe two cell surface-associated aspartic proteases, Sap9 and Sap10, which have structural similarities to yapsins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are produced by the human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Sap9 and Sap10 are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored and located in the cell membrane or the cell wall. Both proteases are glycosylated, cleave at dibasic or basic processing sites similar to yapsins and Kex2-like proteases, and have functions in cell surface integrity and cell separation during budding. Overexpression of SAP9 in mutants lacking KEX2 or SAP10, or of SAP10 in mutants lacking KEX2 or SAP9, only partially restored these phenotypes, suggesting distinct target proteins of fungal origin for each of the three proteases. In addition, deletion of SAP9 and SAP10 modified the adhesion properties of C. albicans to epithelial cells and caused attenuated epithelial cell damage during experimental oral infection suggesting a unique role for these proteases in both cellular processes and host-pathogen interactions.

Early mitotic degradation of Nek2A depends on Cdc20-independent
interaction with the APC/C.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The temporal control of mitotic protein degradation remains incompletely understood. In particular, it is unclear why the mitotic checkpoint prevents the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-mediated degradation of cyclin B and securin in early mitosis, but not cyclin A. Here, we show that another APC/C substrate, NIMA-related kinase 2A (Nek2A), is also destroyed in pro-metaphase in a checkpoint-independent manner and that this depends on an exposed carboxy-terminal methionine-arginine (MR) dipeptide tail. Truncation of the Nek2A C terminus delays its degradation until late mitosis, whereas Nek2A C-terminal peptides interfere with APC/C activity in an MR-dependent manner. Most importantly, we show that Nek2A binds directly to the APC/C, also in an MR-dependent manner, even in the absence of the adaptor protein Cdc20. As similar C-terminal dipeptide tails promote direct association of Cdc20, Cdh1 and Apc10-Doc1 with core APC/C subunits, we propose that this sequence also allows a substrate, Nek2A, to directly bind the APC/C. Thus, although Cdc20 is required for the degradation of Nek2A, it is not required for its recruitment and this renders its degradation insensitive to the mitotic checkpoint.

<ABSTRACT>
The peroxin Pex19p comprising 299 amino acids functions in peroxisomal membrane assembly. We here developed a cell-free system for transport of membrane proteins to peroxisomes. Pex19p interacts with multiple membrane peroxins, including other membrane biogenesis peroxins, Pex16p and Pex26p, involved in matrix protein import. Cell-free synthesized, 35S-labeled Pex19p was targeted to subcellular fractions containing peroxisomes from Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells as well as peroxisomes isolated from rat liver in an ATP-dependent manner. Such translocation was also reproduced with in vitro synthesized 35S-Pex16p with two transmembrane segments and C-tail anchor-type 35S-Pex26p, upon incubation with 35S-Pex19p in the reaction mixtures containing isolated peroxisomes. The transported 35S-Pex16p and 35S-Pex26p were integrated into membranes as assessed by the sodium carbonate extraction method. Peroxisome-associated and partly Na2CO3-resistant 35S-Pex19p was released to the cytosolic fraction upon incubation in the absence of ATP, whereas 35S-Pex16p and 35S-Pex26p remained in the membranes. Furthermore, not only 35S-Pex19p but also 35S-Pex19p complexes each with 35S-Pex16p and 35S-Pex26p were bound to 35S-Pex3p in vitro. Together, these results strongly suggested that Pex19p translocates the membrane peroxins from the cytosol to peroxisomes in an ATP- and Pex3p-dependent manner and then shuttles back to the cytosol.

<ABSTRACT>
A central function of telomeres is to prevent chromosome ends from being recognized as DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Several proteins involved in processing DSBs associate with telomeres, but the roles of these factors at telomeres are largely unknown. To investigate whether the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex is involved in the generation of proper 3' G-overhangs at human telomere ends, we used RNA interference to decrease expression of MRN and analysed their effects. Reduction of MRN resulted in a transient shortening of G-overhang length in telomerase-positive cells. The terminal nucleotides of both C- and G-rich strands remain unaltered in Mre11-diminished cells, indicating that MRN is not responsible for specifying the final end-processing event. The reduction in overhang length was not seen in telomerase-negative cells, but was observed after the expression of exogenous telomerase, which suggested that the MRN complex might be involved in the recruitment or action of telomerase.

The CLN9 protein, a regulator of dihydroceramide synthase.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A new variant of a group of pediatric neurodegenerative diseases known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) or Batten disease has been identified. It is termed CLN9-deficient. CLN9-deficient fibroblasts have a distinctive phenotype of rapid growth and increased apoptosis and diminished levels of ceramide, dihydroceramide, and sphingomyelin. Transfection with CLN8 but not other NCL genes corrected growth and apoptosis in CLN9-deficient cells, although the entire CLN8 sequence was normal. CLN8 is one of the TRAM-Lag1-CLN8 proteins containing a Lag1 motif. The latter imparts (dihydro)ceramide synthase activity to yeast cells. Transfection with the yeast gene Lag1 Sc and the human homolog LASS1 increased ceramide levels and partially corrected growth and apoptosis in CLN9-deficient cells. LASS2,-4,,-5, and -6 also corrected growth and apoptosis. Dihydroceramide levels and dihydroceramide synthase activity were markedly diminished in CLN9-deficient cells. Sequencing of LASS1, LASS2, LASS4, LASS5, and LASS6 genes was normal, and expression levels were increased or normal in CLN9-deficient cells by reverse transcription-PCR. N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR), a dihydroceramide synthase activator, corrected growth and apoptosis and increased dihydroceramide synthase activity. Ceramide levels dropped further, and there was no increase in de novo ceramide synthesis, probably due to the effects of 4-HPR as activator of dihydroceramide synthase and inhibitor of dihydroceramide desaturase. Fumonisin B1, a dihydroceramide synthase inhibitor, exaggerated the CLN9-deficient phenotype of accelerated growth, decreased ceramide and increased apoptosis. This was neutralized by 4-HPR. We conclude that the CLN9 protein may be a regulator of dihydroceramide synthase and that 4-HPR could be developed as a treatment for CLN9-deficient patients.

Telomere length homeostasis requires that telomerase levels are limiting.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Stabilization of telomere length in germline and highly proliferative human cells is required for long-term survival and for the immortal phenotype of cancer-derived cells. This is achieved through expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), which synthesizes telomeric repeats through reverse transcription of its tightly associated RNA template (TR). The telomeric repeat binding factor TRF1 inhibits telomerase at telomeres in cis in a length-dependent manner to achieve telomere length homeostasis. Here we manipulate telomerase activity over a wide range in cancer and primary cells. Concomitant overexpression of TERT and TR was necessary and sufficient to substantially increase telomerase activity. Upon overexpression, more telomerase associated with telomeres and telomeres elongated at a constant rate (up to 0.8 kb/population doubling (PD)) in a length-independent manner. Thus, in less than 50 PDs, the length of telomeres increased 3-8-fold beyond physiological size, while telomere-bound TRF1 and TRF2 increased proportionally to telomere length. Thus, long telomeres do not permanently adopt a structural state that is non-extendible. A low cellular concentration of telomerase is critical to achieve preferential elongation of short telomeres and telomere length homeostasis.

Redox-responsive in vitro modulation of the signalling state of the

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Prr is a global regulatory system that controls a large and diverse range of genes in Rhodobacter sphaeroides in response to changing conditions of environmental redox potential. PrrB is the membrane-bound sensor kinase and previously we showed that the purified, detergent-solubilised intact membrane protein is functional in autophosphorylation, phosphotransfer and phosphatase activities. Here we confirm that it also senses and responds directly to its environmental signal, redox potential; strong autophosphorylation of PrrB occurred in response to dithiothreitol (DTT)-induced reducing conditions (and levels increased in response to a wide 0.1-100 mM DTT range), whilst under oxidising conditions, PrrB exhibited low, just detectable levels of autophosphorylation. The clear response of PrrB to changes in reducing conditions confirmed its suitability for in vitro studies to identify modulators of its phosphorylation signalling state, and was used here to investigate whether PrrB might sense more than one redox-related signal, such as signals of cell energy status. NADH, ATP and AMP were found to exert no detectable effect on maintenance of the PrrB-P signalling state. By contrast, adenosine diphosphate produced a very strong increase in PrrB-P dephosphorylation rate, presumably through the back-conversion of PrrB-P to PrrB.

<ABSTRACT>
We report here the x-ray structure of a covalent serpin-proteinase complex, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha1PI) with porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), which differs from the only other x-ray structure of such a complex, that of alpha1PI with trypsin, in showing nearly complete definition of the proteinase. alpha1PI complexes with trypsin, PPE, and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) showed similar rates of deacylation and enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis by exogenous proteinases in solution. The differences between the two x-ray structures therefore cannot arise from intrinsic differences in the inhibition mechanism. However, self-proteolysis of purified complex resulted in rapid cleavage of the trypsin complex, slower cleavage of the PPE complex, and only minimal cleavage of the HNE complex. This suggests that the earlier alpha1 PI-trypsin complex may have been proteolyzed and that the present structure is more likely to be representative of serpin-proteinase complexes. The present structure shows that active site distortion alone is sufficient for inhibition and suggests that enhanced proteolysis is not necessarily exploited in vivo.

<ABSTRACT>
The general RNA polymerase II transcription factor TFIIE, which is composed of two subunits, has essential roles in both transcription initiation and promoter escape. Electron microscopy analysis of negatively stained human TFIIE showed a large proportion of alpha/beta heterodimers as well as a small proportion of tetramers. Analytical ultracentrifugation, chemical crosslinking, pulldown experiments and cryo-electron microscopy confirmed that TFIIE is a alpha/beta heterodimer in solution. Three-dimensional envelopes of the alpha/beta particles showed an elongated structure composed of three distinct modules. Finally, a model for the quaternary architecture of the complex is proposed that provides a structural framework to discuss the function of TFIIE in the context of RNA polymerase II transcription initiation.

<ABSTRACT>
We examined the inhibition of the expression of some inflammatory genes associated with ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury by anthocyanins isolated from black soybean seed coat in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-treated bovine aortic endothelial cells. In addition, its potential use on I/R-injury was investigated using rats subjected to 30-min occlusion of left descending coronary artery followed by 24-h reperfusion. Western blot analysis and luciferase activity assay showed that anthocyanins inhibited TNF-alpha-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and cyclooxygenase-2 levels, which is through NF-kappaB-dependent pathway. Further, anthocyanins protected myocardiac injury from I/R in rats. It is suggested that anthocyanins from black soybean seed coat can be used as a useful drug to modulate cardiovascular disorder.

Redundant pathways for Cdc2 activation in Xenopus oocyte: either cyclin B
or Mos synthesis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Xenopus oocytes are arrested in meiotic prophase I. Progesterone induces the resumption of meiotic maturation, which requires continuous protein synthesis to bring about Cdc2 activation. The identification of the newly synthesized proteins has long been a goal. Two plausible candidates have received extensive study. The synthesis of cyclin B and of c-Mos, a kinase that activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in oocytes, is clearly upregulated by translational control in response to progesterone. Recent studies suggest that ablation of either c-Mos or cyclin B synthesis by antisense oligonucleotides does not block meiotic maturation. Here, however, we show that when both pathways are simultaneously inhibited, progesterone no longer triggers maturation; adding back either c-Mos or cyclin B restores meiotic maturation. We conclude that the specific synthesis of either B-type cyclins or c-Mos, induced by progesterone, is required to induce meiotic maturation. The two pathways seem to be functionally redundant.

Mechanical inhibition of RANKL expression is regulated by H-Ras-GTPase.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Mechanical input is known to regulate bone remodeling, yet the molecular events involved in mechanical signal transduction are poorly understood. We here investigate proximal events leading to the ERK1/2 activation that is required for mechanical repression of RANKL (receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand) expression, the factor that controls local recruitment of osteoclasts. Using primary murine bone stromal cells we show that dynamic mechanical strain via substrate deformation activates Ras-GTPase, in particular the H-Ras isoform. Pharmacological inhibition of H-Ras function prevents strain activation of H-Ras as well as the downstream mechanical repression of RANKL. Furthermore, small interfering RNA silencing of H-Ras, but not K-Ras, abrogates mechanical strain repression of RANKL. H-Ras-specific inhibition of mechanorepression of RANKL was also demonstrated in a murine pre-osteoblast cell line (CIMC-4). The requirement of cholesterol for H-Ras activation was probed; cholesterol depletion of rafts using methyl-betacyclodextrin prevented mechanical H-Ras activation. That the mechanical repression of RANKL requires activation of H-Ras, a specific isoform of Ras-GTP that is known to reside in the lipid raft microdomain, suggests that spatial arrangements are critical for generation of specific downstream events in response to mechanical signals. By partitioning signals this way, cells may be able to generate different downstream responses through seemingly similar signaling cascades.

<ABSTRACT>
Reliable analysis of the functionality of metalloproteins demands a highly accurate description of both the redox state and geometry of the metal centre, not only in the isolated metalloprotein but also in the transient complex with its target. Here, we demonstrate that the transient interaction between soluble cytochrome c(6) and membrane-embedded photosystem I involves subtle changes in the heme iron, as inferred by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). A slight shift to lower energies of the absorption edge of Fe2+ in cytochrome c6 is observed upon interaction with photosystem I. This work constitutes a novel application of XAS to the analysis of weak complexes in solution.

One of the major problems in chemotherapy is multidrug resistance (MDR) against anticancer drugs. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a family of proteins that mediate MDR via ATP-dependent drug efflux pumps. Many MDR inhibitors have been identified, but none of them have been proven clinically useful without side effects. Efforts continue to discover not toxic MDR inhibitors which lack pharmacokinetic interactions with anticancer drugs. Novel approaches have also been designed to inhibit or circumvent MDR. In this review, the structure and function of ABC transporters and development of MDR inhibitors are described briefly including various approaches to suppress MDR mechanisms.

<ABSTRACT>
Deletion of Lsh perturbs DNA methylation patterns in mice yet it is unknown whether Lsh plays a direct role in the methylation process. Two types of methylation pathways have been distinguished: maintenance methylation by Dnmt1 occurring at the replication fork, and de novo methylation established by the methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. Using an episomal vector in Lsh-/- embryonic fibroblasts, we demonstrate that the acquisition of DNA methylation depends on the presence of Lsh. In contrast, maintenance of previously methylated episomes does not require Lsh, implying a functional role for Lsh in the establishment of novel methylation patterns. Lsh affects Dnmt3a as well as Dnmt3b directed methylation suggesting that Lsh can cooperate with both enzymatic activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that embryonic stem cells with reduced Lsh protein levels show a decreased ability to silence retroviral vector or to methylate endogenous genes. Finally, we demonstrate that Lsh associates with Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b but not with Dnmt1 in embryonic cells. These results suggest that the epigenetic regulator, Lsh, is directly involved in the control of de novo methylation of DNA.

Transferrin receptor-like proteins control the degradation of a yeast
metal transporter.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Plasma membrane transporters are often downregulated by their substrates. The yeast manganese transporter Smf1 is subject to two levels of regulation: heavy metals induce its sequestration within the cell, and also its ubiquitination and degradation in the vacuole. Degradation requires Bsd2, a membrane protein with a PPxY motif that recruits the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5, and which has a role in the quality control of membrane proteins, that expose hydrophilic residues to the lipid bilayer. We show that degradation of Smf1 requires in addition one of a pair of related yeast proteins, Tre1 and Tre2, that also contain PPxY motifs. Tre1 can partially inhibit manganese uptake without Bsd2, but requires Bsd2 to induce Smf1 degradation. It has a relatively hydrophilic transmembrane domain and binds to Bsd2. We propose that the Tre proteins specifically link Smf1 to the Bsd2-dependent quality control system. Their luminal domains are related to the transferrin receptor, but these are dispensable for Smf1 regulation. Tre proteins and the transferrin receptors appear to have evolved independently from the same family of membrane-associated proteases.

<ABSTRACT>
The structure of most of the peripheral stalk, or stator, of the F-ATPase from bovine mitochondria, determined at 2.8 A resolution, contains residues 79-183, 3-123 and 5-70 of subunits b, d and F6, respectively. It consists of a continuous curved alpha-helix about 160 A long in the single b-subunit, augmented by the predominantly alpha-helical d- and F6-subunits. The structure occupies most of the peripheral stalk in a low-resolution structure of the F-ATPase. The long helix in subunit b extends from near to the top of the F1 domain to the surface of the membrane domain, and it probably continues unbroken across the membrane. Its uppermost region interacts with the oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein, bound to the N-terminal region of one alpha-subunit in the F1 domain. Various features suggest that the peripheral stalk is probably rigid rather than resembling a flexible rope. It remains unclear whether the transient storage of energy required by the rotary mechanism takes place in the central stalk or in the peripheral stalk or in both domains.

ETO2 coordinates cellular proliferation and differentiation during

<ABSTRACT>
The passage from proliferation to terminal differentiation is critical for normal development and is often perturbed in malignancies. To define the molecular mechanisms that govern this process during erythropoiesis, we have used tagging/proteomics approaches and characterized protein complexes nucleated by TAL-1/SCL, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that specifies the erythrocytic lineage. In addition to known TAL-1 partners, GATA-1, E2A, HEB, LMO2 and Ldb1, we identify the ETO2 repressor as a novel component recruited to TAL-1 complexes through interaction with E2A/HEB. Ectopic expression and siRNA knockdown experiments in hematopoietic progenitor cells show that ETO2 actively represses erythroid TAL-1 target genes and governs the expansion of erythroid progenitors. At the onset of erythroid differentiation, a change in the stoichiometry of ETO2 within the TAL-1 complex activates the expression of known erythroid-specific TAL-1 target genes and of Gfi-1b and p21(Cip), encoding two essential regulators of erythroid cell proliferation. These results suggest that the dynamics of ETO2 recruitment within nuclear complexes couple cell proliferation to cell differentiation and determine the onset of terminal erythroid maturation.

<ABSTRACT>
Non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abl is a well known regulator of the actin-cytoskeleton, including the formation of stress fibers and membrane ruffles. Vinexin is an adapter protein consisting of three SH3 domains, and involved in signal transduction and the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we found that vinexin alpha as well as beta interacts with c-Abl mainly through the third SH3 domain, and that vinexin and c-Abl were colocalized at membrane ruffles in rat astrocytes. This interaction was reduced by latrunculin B, suggesting an F-actin-mediated regulatory mechanism. We also found that vinexin alpha but not beta was phosphorylated at tyrosine residue when c-Abl or v-Abl was co-expressed. A mutational analysis identified tyrosine 127 on vinexin alpha as a major site of phosphorylation by c- or v-Abl. These results suggest that vinexin alpha is a novel substrate for Abl.

<ABSTRACT>
The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is critical for specific degradation of cellular proteins and plays a pivotal role on protein breakdown in muscle atrophy. Here, we show that ZNF216 directly binds polyubiquitin chains through its N-terminal A20-type zinc-finger domain and associates with the 26S proteasome. ZNF216 was colocalized with the aggresome, which contains ubiquitinylated proteins and other UPS components. Expression of Znf216 was increased in both denervation- and fasting-induced muscle atrophy and upregulated by expression of constitutively active FOXO, a master regulator of muscle atrophy. Mice deficient in Znf216 exhibited resistance to denervation-induced atrophy, and ubiquitinylated proteins markedly accumulated in neurectomized muscle compared to wild-type mice. These data suggest that ZNF216 functions in protein degradation via the UPS and plays a crucial role in muscle atrophy.

Analysis of leptin signalling in hematopoietic cells using an adapted

<ABSTRACT>
The adipocyte-secreted hormone leptin participates in the regulation of hematopoiesis and enhances proliferation of hematopoietic cells. We used an adaptation of the MAPPIT mammalian two-hybrid method to study leptin signalling in a hematopoietic setting. We confirmed the known interactions of suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) and STAT5 with the Y985 and Y1077 motifs of the leptin receptor, respectively. We also provide evidence for novel interactions at the Y1077 motif, including phospholipase C gamma and several members of the SOCS protein family, further underscoring the important role of the Y1077 motif in leptin signalling.

<ABSTRACT>
Homeobox (Hox) gene mutations and their altered expressions are frequently linked to human leukemia. Here, we report that transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibits the bone marrow transformation capability of Hoxa9 and Nup98-Hoxa9, the chimeric fusion form of Hoxa9 identified in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), through Smad4, the common Smad (Co-Smad) in the TGFbeta/BMP signaling pathway. Smad4 interacts directly with the homeodomain of Hoxa9 and blocks the ability of Nup98-Hoxa9 to bind DNA, thereby suppressing its ability to regulate downstream gene transcription. Mapping data revealed that the amino-terminus of Smad4 mediates this interaction and overexpression of the Hoxa9 interaction domain of Smad4 was sufficient to inhibit the enhanced serial replating ability of primary bone marrow cells induced by Nup98-Hoxa9. These studies establish a novel mechanism by which TGFbeta/BMP regulates hematopoiesis and suggest that modification of Hox DNA-binding activity may serve as a novel therapeutic intervention for those leukemias that involve deregulation of Hox.

Membrane and soluble substrates of the Doa10 ubiquitin ligase are degraded
by distinct pathways.

<ABSTRACT>
The yeast Doa10 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/nuclear envelope (NE), where it functions in ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Doa10 substrates include non-ER proteins such as the transcription factor Mat alpha2. Here, we expand the range of Doa10 substrates to include a defective kinetochore component, a mutant NE membrane protein, and a substrate-regulated human ER enzyme. For all these substrates, Doa10 requires two Ub-conjugating enzymes, Ubc6 and Ubc7, as well as the Ubc7 cofactor Cue1. Based on a novel genomic screen of a comprehensive gene deletion library and other data, these four proteins appear to be the only nonessential and nonredundant factors generally required for Doa10-mediated ubiquitination. Notably, the Cdc48 ATPase facilitates degradation of membrane-embedded Doa10 substrates, but is not required for any tested soluble Doa10 substrates. This distinction is maintained even when comparing membrane and soluble proteins bearing the same degradation signal. Thus, while Doa10 ubiquitinates both membrane and soluble proteins, the mechanisms of subsequent proteasome targeting differ.

Plasminogen activation independent of uPA and tPA maintains wound healing
in gene-deficient mice.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Simultaneous ablation of the two known activators of plasminogen (Plg), urokinase-type (uPA) and the tissue-type (tPA), results in a substantial delay in skin wound healing. However, wound closure and epidermal re-epithelialization are significantly less impaired in uPA;tPA double-deficient mice than in Plg-deficient mice. Skin wounds in uPA;tPA-deficient mice treated with the broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor galardin (N-[(2R)-2-(hydroxamido-carbonylmethyl)-4-methylpentanoyl]-L-tryptophan methylamide) eventually heal, whereas skin wounds in galardin-treated Plg-deficient mice do not heal. Furthermore, plasmin is biochemically detectable in wound extracts from uPA;tPA double-deficient mice. In vivo administration of a plasma kallikrein (pKal)-selective form of the serine protease inhibitor ecotin exacerbates the healing impairment of uPA;tPA double-deficient wounds to a degree indistinguishable from that observed in Plg-deficient mice, and completely blocks the activity of pKal, but not uPA and tPA in wound extracts. These findings demonstrate that an additional plasminogen activator provides sufficient plasmin activity to sustain the healing process albeit at decreased speed in the absence of uPA, tPA and galardin-sensitive MMPs and suggest that pKal plays a role in plasmin generation.

Dynamic study of the transition from hyaluronan- to integrin-mediated
adhesion in chondrocytes.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Membrane-bound hyaluronan mediates the initial adhesive interactions between many cell types and external surfaces. In RCJ-P chondrocytes, such early contacts are mediated through a thick hyaluronidase-sensitive coat. The early adhesion is followed by integrin-mediated interactions and the formation of stable focal adhesions. During this process, the distance between the cell membrane and the surface is reduced from micrometers to few tens of nanometers. The transition from hyaluronan- to integrin-mediated adhesion was studied on glass surfaces by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Hyaluronan-mediated adhesion precedes focal adhesions formation by 2-10 min. After these initial interactions, the pericellular hyaluronan remains sequestered into discrete pockets between the cell and the surface, which are a few hundreds nanometers thick and a few micrometers wide, and are flanked by focal adhesions. The hyaluronan coat facilitates the nucleation of small paxillin-rich contacts, which later mature into focal adhesions. These dynamic studies demonstrate that pericellular hyaluronan mediates initial cell-surface adhesion, and regulates the formation of focal adhesions.

Surveillance of nuclear-restricted pre-ribosomes within a subnucleolar
region of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We previously hypothesized that HEAT-repeat (Huntington, elongation A subunit, TOR) ribosome synthesis factors function in ribosome export. We report that the HEAT-repeat protein Sda1p is a component of late 60S pre-ribosomes and is required for nuclear export of both ribosomal subunits. In strains carrying the ts-lethal sda1-2 mutation, pre-60S particles were rapidly degraded following transfer to 37 degrees C. Polyadenylated forms of the 27S pre-rRNA and the 25S rRNA were detected, suggesting the involvement of the Trf4p/Air/Mtr4p polyadenylation complex (TRAMP). The absence of Trf4p suppressed polyadenylation and stabilized the pre-rRNA and rRNA. The absence of the nuclear exosome component Rrp6p also conferred RNA stabilization, with some hyperadenylation. We conclude that the nuclear-restricted pre-ribosomes are polyadenylated by TRAMP and degraded by the exosome. In sda1-2 strains at 37 degrees C, pre-40S and pre-60S ribosomes initially accumulated in the nucleoplasm, but then strongly concentrated in a subnucleolar focus, together with exosome and TRAMP components. Localization of pre-ribosomes to this focus was lost in sda1-2 strains lacking Trf4p or Rrp6p. We designate this nucleolar focus the No-body and propose that it represents a site of pre-ribosome surveillance.

A rivet model for channel formation by aerolysin-like pore-forming toxins.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The bacterial toxin aerolysin kills cells by forming heptameric channels, of unknown structure, in the plasma membrane. Using disulfide trapping and cysteine scanning mutagenesis coupled to thiol-specific labeling on lipid bilayers, we identify a loop that lines the channel. This loop has an alternating pattern of charged and uncharged residues, suggesting that the transmembrane region has a beta-barrel configuration, as observed for Staphylococcal alpha-toxin. Surprisingly, we found that the turn of the beta-hairpin is composed of a stretch of five hydrophobic residues. We show that this hydrophobic turn drives membrane insertion of the developing channel and propose that, once the lipid bilayer has been crossed, it folds back parallel to the plane of the membrane in a rivet-like fashion. This rivet-like conformation was modeled and sequence alignments suggest that such channel riveting may operate for many other pore-forming toxins.

<ABSTRACT>
Slingshot-1L (SSH1L) is a phosphatase that specifically dephosphorylates and activates cofilin, an actin-severing and -depolymerizing protein. SSH1L binds to and is activated by F-actin in vitro, and co-localizes with F-actin in cultured cells. We examined the F-actin-binding activity, F-actin-mediated phosphatase activation, and subcellular distribution of various mutants of SSH1L. We identified three sites involved in F-actin binding of SSH1L: Trp-458 close to the C-terminus of the phosphatase domain, an LHK motif in the N-terminal region, and an LKR motif in the C-terminal region. These sites play unique roles in the control of subcellular localization and F-actin-mediated activation of SSH1L.

A role for fibronectin-leucine-rich transmembrane cell-surface proteins in
homotypic cell adhesion.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The fibronectin-leucine-rich transmembrane (FLRT) family of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins is implicated in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling, early embryonic development and neurite outgrowth. Here, we have analysed whether FLRTs may also function in cell adhesion. We find that FLRT proteins can physically interact and that FLRT-transfected cultured cells sort out from non-transfected cells, suggesting a change in adhesive properties. A similar sorting effect is also observed in Xenopus embryos and tissue aggregates. FLRT-mediated cell sorting is calcium dependent and substrate independent. Deletion analysis indicates that cell sorting requires the LRR domains, which are dispensable for FLRT-mediated FGF signalling. Conversely, sorting is independent of the cytoplasmic domain, which is essential for FLRT-induced signalling. Therefore, FLRT-mediated FGF signal transduction and homotypic cell sorting can be molecularly uncoupled. The results indicate that FLRT proteins have a dual role, promoting FGF signalling and modulating homotypic cell adhesion.

The expanded octarepeat domain selectively binds prions and disrupts
homomeric prion protein interactions.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Insertion of additional octarepeats into the prion protein gene has been genetically linked to familial Creutzfeldt Jakob disease and hence to de novo generation of infectious prions. The pivotal event during prion formation is the conversion of the normal prion protein (PrPC) into the pathogenic conformer PrPSc, which subsequently induces further conversion in an autocatalytic manner. Apparently, an expanded octarepeat domain directs folding of PrP toward the PrPSc conformation and initiates a self-replicating conversion process. Here, based on three main observations, we have provided a model on how altered molecular interactions between wild-type and mutant PrP set the stage for familial Creutzfeldt Jakob disease with octarepeat insertions. First, we showed that wild-type octarepeat domains interact in a copper-dependent and reversible manner, a "copper switch." This interaction becomes irreversible upon domain expansion, possibly reflecting a loss of function. Second, expanded octarepeat domains of increasing length gradually form homogenous globular multimers of 11-21 nm in the absence of copper ions when expressed as soluble glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Third, octarepeat domain expansion causes a gain of function with at least 10 repeats selectively binding PrPSc in a denaturant-resistant complex in the absence of copper ions. Thus, the combination of both a loss and gain of function profoundly influences homomeric interaction behavior of PrP with an expanded octarepeat domain. A multimeric cluster of prion proteins carrying expanded octarepeat domains may therefore capture and incorporate spontaneously arising short-lived PrPSc-like conformers, thereby providing a matrix for their conversion.

<ABSTRACT>
Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 are cytokines that inhibit bone resorption. Data showing an inhibitory effect of IL-4 and IL-13 on RANK mRNA in mouse calvariae were first reported at the 22nd American Society for Bone and Mineral Research Meeting (Lerner, U.H., and Conaway, H. H. 2000) J. Bone Min. Res. 15, Suppl. 1, Abstr. SU 230). In the present study, release of 45Ca from cultured mouse calvarial bones stimulated by different cytokines, peptides, and steroid hormones was inhibited by IL-4 and IL-13. IL-4 and IL-13 decreased receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and RANK mRNA and increased osteoprotegerin (OPG) mRNA in calvariae. Additionally, the cytokines decreased RANKL protein and increased OPG protein in calvarial bones. In osteoblasts isolated from calvariae, both an increase in RANKL mRNA and a decrease in OPG mRNA and protein elicited by vitamin D3 were reversed by IL-4 and IL-13. IL-4 and IL-13 decreased the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase positive multinucleated cells and the mRNA expression of calcitonin receptor, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and cathepsin K in mouse spleen cells and bone marrow macrophages (BMM) treated with macrophage colony-stimulating factor and RANKL. Inhibition of mRNA for RANK and the transcription factor NFAT2 was also noted in spleen cell and BMM cultures treated with IL-4 and IL-13. In addition, RANK mRNA and RANK protein were decreased by IL-4 and IL-13 in RAW 264.7 cells. Osteoblasts, spleen cells, and BMM expressed mRNA for the four proteins making up the IL-4 and IL-13 receptors. No effects by IL-4 on bone resorption and osteoclast formation or on RANKL and RANK mRNA expression were seen in Stat6-/- mice. The data indicate that IL-4 and IL-13, via a STAT6-dependent pathway, inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by activating receptors on osteoblasts and osteoclasts that affect the RANKL/RANK/OPG system.

</TITLE>

<ABSTRACT>
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a life-threatening human pathogen that is increasingly resistant to a wide array of drugs. Resistance to beta-lactams, the most widely used antibiotics, is correlated with tens of amino acid substitutions in their targets; that is, the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), resulting from multiple events of recombination. To discriminate relevant substitutions from those that are incidental to the recombination process, we report the exhaustive characterization of all the mutations in the transpeptidase domain of PBP2x from the highly resistant strain 5204. A semi-automated method combining biochemical and microbiological approaches singled out 6 mutations of 41 (15%) that are essential for high level resistance. The hitherto uncharacterized I371T, R384G, M400T, and N605T together with the previously studied T338M and M339F account for nearly all the loss of affinity of PBP2x for beta-lactams. Most interestingly, I371T and R384G cause the conformational change of a loop that borders the entrance of the active site cavity, hampering antibiotic binding. For the first time all the mutations of a PBP relevant to beta-lactam resistance have been identified, providing new mechanistic insights. Most notable is the relationship between the decreased susceptibility to beta-lactams and the dynamic behavior of a loop.

<ABSTRACT>
A novel estrogen receptor (ER)alpha coactivator complex, the MLL2 complex, which consists of MLL2, ASH2, RBQ3, and WDR5, was identified. ERalpha directly binds to the MLL2 complex through two LXXLL motifs in a region of MLL2 near the C terminus in a ligand-dependent manner. Disrupting the interaction between ERalpha and the MLL2 complex with small interfering RNAs specific against MLL2 or an MLL2 fragment representing the interacting region with ERalpha significantly inhibited the ERalpha transcription activity. The MLL2 complex was recruited on promoters of ERalpha target genes along with ERalpha upon estrogen stimulation. Inhibition of MLL2 expression decreased the estrogen-induced expression of ERalpha target genes cathepsin D and to a lesser extent pS2. In addition, MCF-7 cell growth was also inhibited by the depletion of MLL2. These results demonstrate that the ERalpha signaling pathway is critically dependent on its direct interaction with the MLL2 complex and suggest a central role for the MLL2 complex in the growth of ERalpha-positive cancer cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Engagement of the T-cell antigen receptor leads to recruitment of phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1) to the LAT-nucleated signaling complex and to PLCgamma1 activation in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. The mechanism of PLCgamma1 recruitment and the role of PLCgamma1 Src homology (SH) domains in this process remain incompletely understood. Using a combination of biochemical methods and real-time fluorescent imaging, we show here that the N-terminal SH2 domain of PLCgamma1 is necessary but not sufficient for its recruitment. Either the SH3 or C-terminal SH2 domain of PLCgamma1, with the participation of Vav1, c-Cbl and Slp76, are required to stabilize PLCgamma1 recruitment. All three PLCgamma1 SH domains are required for phosphorylation of PLCgamma1 Y783, which is critical for enzyme activation. These novel findings entailed revision of the currently accepted model of PLCgamma1 recruitment and activation in T lymphocytes.

Induction of oxidative metabolism by mitochondrial frataxin inhibits

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
More than 80 years ago Otto Warburg suggested that cancer might be caused by a decrease in mitochondrial energy metabolism paralleled by an increase in glycolytic flux. In later years, it was shown that cancer cells exhibit multiple alterations in mitochondrial content, structure, function, and activity. We have stably overexpressed the Friedreich ataxia-associated protein frataxin in several colon cancer cell lines. These cells have increased oxidative metabolism, as shown by concurrent increases in aconitase activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular respiration, and ATP content. Consistent with Warburg's hypothesis, we found that frataxin-overexpressing cells also have decreased growth rates and increased population doubling times, show inhibited colony formation capacity in soft agar assays, and exhibit a reduced capacity for tumor formation when injected into nude mice. Furthermore, overexpression of frataxin leads to an increased phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, as well as decreased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Taken together, these results support the view that an increase in oxidative metabolism induced by mitochondrial frataxin may inhibit cancer growth in mammals.

Dual role of the Cdc7-regulatory protein Dbf4 during yeast meiosis.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase (DDK) is essential for chromosome duplication in all eukaryotes, but was proposed to be dispensable for yeast pre-meiotic DNA replication. This discrepancy led us to investigate the role of the unstable Cdc7-regulatory protein Dbf4 in meiosis. We show that, when Dbf4 is depleted at the time of meiotic induction, cells enter the meiotic program but do not replicate their chromosomes. Surprisingly when Dbf4 is depleted after the initiation of DNA synthesis, S phase goes to completion, but most cells arrest before anaphase I. Deletion of the cohesin Rec8 suppresses this phenotype, suggesting a distinct role of DDK for meiotic chromosome segregation. As after Cdc5 depletion, a fraction of cells undergo a single equational division suggesting a failure to mono-orient sister kinetochores. Our results demonstrate that Dbf4 is essential for DNA replication during meiosis like in vegetative cells and provide evidence for an additional role in setting up the reductional division of meiosis I.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In plant Ca(2+) pumps belonging to the P(2B) subfamily of P-type ATPases, the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain is responsible for pump autoinhibition. Binding of calmodulin (CaM) to this region results in pump activation but the structural basis for CaM activation is still not clear. All residues in a putative CaM-binding domain (Arg(43) to Lys(68)) were mutagenized and the resulting recombinant proteins were studied with respect to CaM binding and the activation state. The results demonstrate that (i) the binding site for CaM is overlapping with the autoinhibitory region and (ii) the autoinhibitory region comprises significantly fewer residues than the CaM-binding region. In a helical wheel projection of the CaM-binding domain, residues involved in autoinhibition cluster on one side of the helix, which is proposed to interact with an intramolecular receptor site in the pump. Residues influencing CaM negatively are situated on the other face of the helix, likely to face the cytosol, whereas residues controlling CaM binding positively are scattered throughout. We propose that early CaM recognition is mediated by the cytosolic face and that CaM subsequently competes with the intramolecular autoinhibitor in binding to the other face of the helix.

<ABSTRACT>
We cloned a full-length androgen receptor (AR) cDNA from chicken (Gallus gallus) gonads. The cDNA sequence has an open reading frame of 2109 bp encoding 703 amino acids. The chicken AR (cAR) shares high homology with ARs from other species in its amino acid sequences, in particular DNA binding domain (DBD) and ligand binding domain (LBD). RT-PCR analysis revealed that cAR mRNA is expressed in several embryonic tissues of both sexes, and relatively higher expression was observed in left ovary compared with testis. The immunoreactive signal of AR was co-localized within the ovarian cell nucleus, while such nuclear localization was not detected in those of testis. To get insight on the possible role of androgen-AR signaling during gonadal development, non-steroidal AR antagonist, flutamide, was administrated in ovo. The treatment induced the disorganization of sex cords in ovarian cortex at day 12 of incubation. The effect was restored by testosterone co-treatment, implying the possibility that AR mediated signaling may be involved in ovarian morphogenesis. Furthermore, co-treatment of flutamide with estradiol-17beta (E2) also restored the phenotype, suggesting androgen-AR signaling might activate aromatase expression that is necessary for estrogen synthesis. These findings suggest androgen-AR signaling might contribute to chicken embryonic ovarian development.

<ABSTRACT>
We have combined nucleoside analog interference with chemical footprinting, thermal denaturation, NMR spectroscopy, and biochemical studies to understand recognition of the polypurine tract (PPT) primer of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae long terminal repeat-containing retrotransposon Ty3 by its cognate reverse transcriptase. Locked nucleic acid analogs, which constrain sugar ring geometry, were introduced pairwise throughout the PPT (-)-DNA template, whereas abasic tetrahydrofuran linkages, which lack the nucleobase but preserve the sugar phosphate backbone, were introduced throughout the (-)-strand DNA template and (+)-strand RNA primer. Collectively, our data suggest that both the 5'- and 3'-portions of the PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrid are sensitive to nucleoside analog substitution, whereas the intervening region can be modified without altering cleavage specificity. These two regions most likely correspond to portions of the PPT that make close contact with the Ty3 reverse transcriptase thumb subdomain and RNase H catalytic center, respectively. Achieving a similar phenotype with nucleoside analogs that have different effects on duplex geometry reveals structural features that are important mediators of Ty3 PPT recognition. Finally, the results from introducing tetrahydrofuran lesions around the scissile PPT/unique 3'-sequence junction indicate that template nucleobase -1 is dispensable for catalysis, whereas a primer nucleobase on either side of the junction is necessary.

<ABSTRACT>
Bcl10 overexpression and nuclear translocation were originally identified in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma with t(1;14)(p32;q32) chromosome translocation. DNA amplification of Bcl10 was also found in other solid tumors. We have recently shown that nuclear translocation of Bcl10 is a specific molecular determinant of Helicobacter pylori-independent mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (Kuo, S.-H., Chen, L. T., Yeh, K.-H., Wu, M. S., Hsu, H. C., Yeh, P. Y., Mao, T. L., Chen, C. L., Doong, S. L., Lin, J. T., and Cheng, A.-L. (2004) J. Clin. Oncol. 22, 3491-3497). However, the molecular mechanism of Bcl10 nuclear translocation remains unknown. In this study, we observed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) up-regulates the expression of Bcl10 and induces a fraction of Bcl10 nuclear translocation in human breast carcinoma MCF7 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that an NF-kappaB-binding site resides in the Bcl10 5 '-untranslated region. This study also demonstrates that Akt1, activated by TNFalpha, phosphorylates Bcl10 at Ser218 and Ser231 and that phosphorylated Bcl10 subsequently complexes with Bcl3 to enter the nucleus. Either inhibition of Akt1 or depletion of Bcl3 blocks Bcl10 nuclear translocation. In summary, these findings characterize a molecular linkage that directs Bcl10 nuclear translocation in response to TNFalpha treatment.

ICER induced by hyperglycemia represses the expression of genes essential
for insulin exocytosis.
</TITLE>

<ABSTRACT>
The GTPases Rab3a and Rab27a and their effectors Granuphilin/Slp4 and Noc2 are essential regulators of neuroendocrine secretion. Chronic exposure of pancreatic beta-cells to supraphysiological glucose levels decreased selectively the expression of these proteins. This glucotoxic effect was mimicked by cAMP-raising agents and blocked by PKA inhibitors. We demonstrate that the transcriptional repressor ICER, which is induced in a PKA-dependent manner by chronic hyperglycemia and cAMP-raising agents, is responsible for the decline of the four genes. ICER overexpression diminished the level of Granuphilin, Noc2, Rab3a and Rab27a by binding to cAMP responsive elements located in the promoters of these genes and inhibited exocytosis of beta-cells in response to secretagogues. Moreover, the loss in the expression of the genes of the secretory machinery caused by glucose and cAMP-raising agents was prevented by an antisense construct that reduces ICER levels. We propose that induction of inappropriate ICER levels lead to defects in the secretory process of pancreatic beta-cells possibly contributing, in conjunction with other known deleterious effects of hyperglycemia, to defective insulin release in type 2 diabetes.

Controlling the subcellular localization of DNA polymerases iota and eta
via interactions with ubiquitin.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Y-family DNA polymerases have spacious active sites that can accommodate a wide variety of geometric distortions. As a consequence, they are considerably more error-prone than high-fidelity replicases. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the in vivo activity of these polymerases is tightly regulated, so as to minimize their inadvertent access to primer-termini. We report here that one such mechanism employed by human cells relies on a specific and direct interaction between DNA polymerases iota and eta with ubiquitin (Ub). Indeed, we show that both polymerases interact noncovalently with free polyUb chains, as well as mono-ubiquitinated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Ub-PCNA). Mutants of poliota (P692R) and poleta (H654A) were isolated that are defective in their interactions with polyUb and Ub-PCNA, whilst retaining their ability to interact with unmodified PCNA. Interestingly, the polymerase mutants exhibit significantly lower levels of replication foci in response to DNA damage, thereby highlighting the biological importance of the polymerase-Ub interaction in regulating the access of the TLS polymerases to stalled replication forks in vivo.

C to U editing stimulates A to I editing in the anticodon loop of a
cytoplasmic threonyl tRNA in Trypanosoma brucei.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Editing of tRNAs is widespread in nature and either changes the decoding properties or restores the folding of a tRNA. Unlike the phylogenetically disperse adenosine (A) to inosine (I) editing, cytosine (C) to uridine (U) editing has only been previously described in organellar tRNAs. We have shown that cytoplasmic tRNA(Thr)(AGU) undergoes two distinct editing events in the anticodon loop: C to U and A to I. In vivo, every inosine-containing tRNA(Thr) is also C to U edited at position 32. In vitro, C to U editing stimulates conversion of A to I at the wobble base. Although the in vivo and in vitro requirements differ, in both cases, the C to U change plays a key role in A to I editing. Due to an unusual abundance of A34-containing tRNAs, our results also suggest that the unedited and edited tRNAs are functional, each dedicated to decoding a specific threonine codon. C to U editing of cytoplasmic tRNA expands the editing repertoire in eukaryotic cells, and when coupled to A to I changes, leads to an interrelation between editing sites.

Distinct genes encode type II Topoisomerases for the nucleus and
mitochondrion in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Topoisomerases are essential for orderly nucleic acid metabolism and cell survival and are proven targets for clinically useful antimicrobial and anticancer drugs. Interest in the topologically intricate mitochondrial DNA (kinetoplast or kDNA) of Trypanosoma brucei brucei and related kinetoplastid protozoan parasites has led to many reports of type II topoisomerases that participate in kDNA metabolism (we term the T. brucei brucei gene TbTOP2mt). We have now identified and characterized two new genes for type II topoisomerases in T. brucei brucei, termed TbTOP2alpha and TbTOP2beta. Phylogenetically, they share a common node with other nuclear topoisomerases, clearly distinct from a clade that includes the previously reported kinetoplastid genes, all of which are homologs of TbTOP2mt. Southern blot analysis reveals the new genes are single copy and positioned approximately 1.7 kb apart. Cognate mRNAs are expressed in African trypanosomes, but only a single message is detected in Leishmania or Crithidia. TbTOP2alpha encodes an ATP-dependent topoisomerase that appears as a single approximately 170-kDa band on immunoblots and localizes to the nucleus; RNA interference leads to pleomorphic nuclear (but not kDNA) abnormalities and early growth arrest. The role of TbTOP2beta is unclear. Although transcribed in trypanosomes, TbTOP2beta is not detected by beta-specific antiserum, and RNAi silencing results in no obvious phenotype. These studies indicate that African trypanosomes and related kinetoplastid human pathogens are unusual in having independent topoisomerase II genes to service their nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and they highlight TbTOP2alpha as a promising target for the development of much-needed new therapies.

Hydrolysis of phosphatidylserine-exposing red blood cells by secretory

dysfunction.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Secretory phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)) type IIa, elevated in inflammation, breaks down membrane phospholipids and generates arachidonic acid. We hypothesized that sPLA(2) will hydrolyze red blood cells that expose phosphatidylserine (PS) and generate lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) from phosphatidic acid that is elevated in PS-exposing red blood cells. In turn, LPA, a powerful lipid mediator, could affect vascular endothelial cell function. Although normal red blood cells were not affected by sPLA(2), at levels of sPLA(2) observed under inflammatory conditions (100 ng/ml) PS-exposing red blood cells hemolyzed and generated LPA (1.2 nM/10(8) RBC). When endothelial cell monolayers were incubated in vitro with LPA, a loss of confluence was noted. Moreover, a dose-dependent increase in hydraulic conductivity was identified in rat mesenteric venules in vivo with 5 microM LPA, and the combination of PS-exposing red blood cells with PLA(2) caused a similar increase in permeability. In the presence of N-palmitoyl L-serine phosphoric acid, a competitive inhibitor for the endothelial LPA receptor, loss of confluence in vitro and the hydraulic permeability caused by 5 microM LPA in vivo were abolished. The present study demonstrates that increased sPLA(2) activity in inflammation in the presence of cells that have lost their membrane phospholipid asymmetry can lead to LPA-mediated endothelial dysfunction and loss of vascular integrity.

<ABSTRACT>
Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria exploit the H+ -consuming reaction catalysed by glutamate decarboxylase to survive the stomach acidity before reaching the intestine. Here we show that chloride, extremely abundant in gastric secretions, is an allosteric activator producing a 10-fold increase in the decarboxylase activity at pH 5.6. Cooperativity and sensitivity to chloride were lost when the N-terminal 14 residues, involved in the formation of two triple-helix bundles, were deleted by mutagenesis. X-ray structures, obtained in the presence of the substrate analogue acetate, identified halide-binding sites at the base of each N-terminal helix, showed how halide binding is responsible for bundle stability and demonstrated that the interconversion between active and inactive forms of the enzyme is a stepwise process. We also discovered an entirely novel structure of the cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (aldamine) to be responsible for the reversibly inactivated enzyme. Our results link the entry of chloride ions, via the H+/Cl- exchange activities of ClC-ec1, to the trigger of the acid stress response in the cell when the intracellular proton concentration has not yet reached fatal values.

The differentiation-dependent desmosomal cadherin desmoglein 1 is a novel
caspase-3 target that regulates apoptosis in keratinocytes.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Although a number of cell adhesion proteins have been identified as caspase substrates, the potential role of differentiation-specific desmosomal cadherins during apoptosis has not been examined. Here, we demonstrate that UV-induced caspase cleavage of the human desmoglein 1 cytoplasmic tail results in distinct 17- and 140- kDa products, whereas metalloproteinase-dependent shedding of the extracellular adhesion domain generates a 75-kDa product. In vitro studies identify caspase-3 as the preferred enzyme that cleaves desmoglein 1 within its unique repeating unit domain at aspartic acid 888, part of a consensus sequence not conserved among the other desmosomal cadherins. Apoptotic processing leads to decreased cell surface expression of desmoglein 1 and re-localization of its C terminus diffusely throughout the cytoplasm over a time course comparable with the processing of other desmosomal proteins and cytoplasmic keratins. Importantly, whereas classic cadherins have been reported to promote cell survival, short hairpin RNA-mediated suppression of desmoglein 1 in differentiated keratinocytes protected cells from UV-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our results identify desmoglein 1 as a novel caspase and metalloproteinase substrate whose cleavage likely contributes to the dismantling of desmosomes during keratinocyte apoptosis and also reveal desmoglein 1 as a previously unrecognized regulator of apoptosis in keratinocytes.

A splice variant of stress response gene ATF3 counteracts

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Activating transcription factor (ATF) 3 plays a role in determining cell fate and generates a variety of alternatively spliced isoforms in stress response. We have reported previously that splice variant ATF3deltaZip2, which lacks the leucine zipper region, is induced in response to various stress stimuli. However, its biological function has not been elucidated. By using cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha and actinomycin D or cells overexpressing ATF3deltaZip2, we showed that ATF3deltaZip2 sensitizes cells to apoptotic cell death in response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha, at least in part through suppressing nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-dependent transcription of anti-apoptotic genes such as cIAP2 and XIAP. ATF3deltaZip2 interacts with a p65 (RelA)-cofactor complex containing CBP/p300 and HDAC1 at NF-kappaB sites of the proximal promoter region of the cIAP2 gene in vivo and down-regulates the recruitment of CBP/p300. Our study revealed that ATF3deltaZip2 counteracts anti-apoptotic activity of NF-kappaB, at least in part, by displacing positive cofactor CBP/p300 and provides insight into the mechanism by which ATF3 regulates cell fate through alternative splicing in stress response.

A Drosophila model of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy reveals intrinsic
toxicity of PABPN1.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an adult-onset syndrome characterized by progressive degeneration of particular muscles. OPMD is caused by short GCG repeat expansions within the gene encoding the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABPN1) that extend an N-terminal polyalanine tract in the protein. Mutant PABPN1 aggregates as nuclear inclusions in OMPD patient muscles. We have created a Drosophila model of OPMD that recapitulates the features of the human disorder: progressive muscle degeneration, with muscle defects proportional to the number of alanines in the tract, and formation of PABPN1 nuclear inclusions. Strikingly, the polyalanine tract is not absolutely required for muscle degeneration, whereas another domain of PABPN1, the RNA-binding domain and its function in RNA binding are required. This demonstrates that OPMD does not result from polyalanine toxicity, but from an intrinsic property of PABPN1. We also identify several suppressors of the OPMD phenotype. This establishes our OPMD Drosophila model as a powerful in vivo test to understand the disease process and develop novel therapeutic strategies.

Notch1 augments NF-kappaB activity by facilitating its nuclear retention.
</TITLE>

<ABSTRACT>
Notch1 specifically upregulates expression of the cytokine interferon-gamma in peripheral T cells through activation of NF-kappaB. However, how Notch mediates NF-kappaB activation remains unclear. Here, we examined the temporal relationship between Notch signaling and NF-kappaB induction during T-cell activation. NF-kappaB activation occurs within minutes of T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement and this activation is sustained for at least 48 h following TCR signaling. We used gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) to prevent the cleavage and subsequent activation of Notch family members. We demonstrate that GSI blocked the later, sustained NF-kappaB activation, but did not affect the initial activation of NF-kappaB. Using biochemical approaches, as well as confocal microscopy, we show that the intracellular domain of Notch1 (N1IC) directly interacts with NF-kappaB and competes with IkappaBalpha, leading to retention of NF-kappaB in the nucleus. Additionally, we show that N1IC can directly regulate IFN-gamma expression through complexes formed on the IFN-gamma promoter. Taken together, these data suggest that there are two 'waves' of NF-kappaB activation: an initial, Notch-independent phase, and a later, sustained activation of NF-kappaB, which is Notch dependent.

Improved photobiological H2 production in engineered green algal cells.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Oxygenic photosynthetic organisms use solar energy to split water (H2O) into protons (H+), electrons (e-), and oxygen. A select group of photosynthetic microorganisms, including the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has evolved the additional ability to redirect the derived H+ and e- to drive hydrogen (H2) production via the chloroplast hydrogenases HydA1 and A2 (H2 ase). This process occurs under anaerobic conditions and provides a biological basis for solar-driven H2 production. However, its relatively poor yield is a major limitation for the economic viability of this process. To improve H2 production in Chlamydomonas, we have developed a new approach to increase H+ and e- supply to the hydrogenases. In a first step, mutants blocked in the state 1 transition were selected. These mutants are inhibited in cyclic e- transfer around photosystem I, eliminating possible competition for e- with H2ase. Selected strains were further screened for increased H2 production rates, leading to the isolation of Stm6. This strain has a modified respiratory metabolism, providing it with two additional important properties as follows: large starch reserves (i.e. enhanced substrate availability), and a low dissolved O2 concentration (40% of the wild type (WT)), resulting in reduced inhibition of H2ase activation. The H2 production rates of Stm6 were 5-13 times that of the control WT strain over a range of conditions (light intensity, culture time, +/- uncoupler). Typically, approximately 540 ml of H2 liter(-1) culture (up to 98% pure) were produced over a 10-14-day period at a maximal rate of 4 ml h(-1) (efficiency = approximately 5 times the WT). Stm6 therefore represents an important step toward the development of future solar-powered H2 production systems.

<ABSTRACT>
G6P translocase (G6PT) is thought to play a crucial role in transducing intracellular signaling events in brain tumor-derived cancer cells. In this report, we investigated the contribution of G6PT to the control of U-87 brain tumor-derived glioma cell survival using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated suppression of G6PT. Three siRNA constructs were generated and found to suppress up to 91% G6PT gene expression. Flow cytometry analysis of propidium iodide/annexin-V-stained cells indicated that silencing the G6PT gene induced necrosis and late apoptosis. The anticancer agent curcumin, also inhibited G6PT gene expression by more than 90% and triggered U-87 glioma cells death. Overexpression of recombinant G6PT rescued the cells from curcumin-induced cell death. Targeting G6PT expression may provide a new mechanistic rationale for the action of chemopreventive drugs and lead to the development of new anti-cancer strategies.

Hyaluronan oligosaccharides induce matrix metalloproteinase 13 via

chondrocytes.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Hyaluronan exerts a variety of biological effects on cells including changes in cell migration, proliferation, and matrix metabolism. However, the signaling pathways associated with the action of hyaluronan on cells have not been clearly defined. In some cells, signaling is induced by the loss of cell-hyaluronan interactions. The goal of this study was to use hyaluronan oligosaccharides as a molecular tool to explore the effects of changes in cell-hyaluronan interactions and determine the underlying molecular events that become activated. In this study, hyaluronan oligosaccharides induced the loss of extracellular matrix proteoglycan and collagen from cultured slices of normal adult human articular cartilage. This loss was coincident with an increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13. MMP-13 expression was also induced in articular chondrocytes by hyaluronan (HA) hexasaccharides but not by HA tetrasaccharides nor high molecular weight hyaluronan. MMP-13 promoter-reporter constructs in CD44-null COS-7 cells revealed that both CD44-dependent and CD44-independent events mediate the induction of MMP-13 by hyaluronan oligosaccharides. Electromobility gel shift assays demonstrated the activation of chondrocyte NFkappaB by hyaluronan oligosaccharides. NFkappaB activation was also documented in C-28/I2 immortalized human chondrocytes by luciferase promoter assays and phosphorylation of IKK-alpha/beta. The link between activation of NFkappaB and MMP-13 induction by HA oligosaccharides was further confirmed through the use of the NFkappaB inhibitor helenalin. Inhibition of MAP kinases also demonstrated the involvement of p38 MAP kinase in the hyaluronan oligosaccharide induction of MMP-13. Our findings suggest that hyaluronan-CD44 interactions affect matrix metabolism via activation of NFkappaB and p38 MAP kinase.

Interaction of Huntingtin-associated protein-1 with kinesin light chain:

<ABSTRACT>
Huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1) was initially identified as an interacting partner of huntingtin, the Huntington disease protein. Unlike huntingtin that is ubiquitously expressed throughout the brain and body, HAP1 is enriched in neurons, suggesting that its dysfunction could contribute to Huntington disease neuropathology. Growing evidence has demonstrated that HAP1 and huntingtin are anterogradely transported in axons and that the abnormal interaction between mutant huntingtin and HAP1 may impair axonal transport. However, the exact role of HAP1 in anterograde transport remains unclear. Here we report that HAP1 interacts with kinesin light chain, a subunit of the kinesin motor complex that drives anterograde transport along microtubules in neuronal processes. The interaction of HAP1 with kinesin light chain is demonstrated via a yeast two-hybrid assay, glutathione S-transferase pull down, and coimmunoprecipitation. Furthermore, HAP1 is colocalized with kinesin in growth cones of neuronal cells. We also demonstrated that knocking down HAP1 via small interfering RNA suppresses neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Analysis of live neuronal cells with fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching demonstrates that suppressing the expression of HAP1 or deleting the HAP1 gene inhibits the kinesin-dependent transport of amyloid precursor protein vesicles. These studies provide a molecular basis for the participation of HAP1 in anterograde transport in neuronal cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Ppt1 is the yeast member of a novel family of protein phosphatases, which is characterized by the presence of a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. Ppt1 is known to bind to Hsp90, a molecular chaperone that performs essential functions in the folding and activation of a large number of client proteins. The function of Ppt1 in the Hsp90 chaperone cycle remained unknown. Here, we analyzed the function of Ppt1 in vivo and in vitro. We show that purified Ppt1 specifically dephosphorylates Hsp90. This activity requires Hsp90 to be directly attached to Ppt1 via its TPR domain. Deletion of the ppt1 gene leads to hyperphosphorylation of Hsp90 in vivo and an apparent decrease in the efficiency of the Hsp90 chaperone system. Interestingly, several Hsp90 client proteins were affected in a distinct manner. Our findings indicate that the Hsp90 multichaperone cycle is more complex than was previously thought. Besides its regulation via the Hsp90 ATPase activity and the sequential binding and release of cochaperones, with Ppt1, a specific phosphatase exists, which positively modulates the maturation of Hsp90 client proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Using a dual pipette assay that measures the force required to separate adherent cell doublets, we have quantitatively compared intercellular adhesiveness mediated by Type I (E- or N-cadherin) or Type II (cadherin-7 or -11) cadherins. At similar cadherin expression levels, cells expressing Type I cadherins adhered much more rapidly and strongly than cells expressing Type II cadherins. Using chimeric cadherins, we found that the extracellular domain exerts by far the dominant effect on cell adhesivity, that of E-cadherin conferring high adhesivity, and that of cadherin-7 conferring low adhesivity. Type I cadherins were incorporated to a greater extent into detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal complexes, and their cytoplasmic tails were much more effective in disrupting strong adherent junctions, suggesting that Type II cadherins form less stable complexes with beta-catenin. The present study demonstrates compellingly, for the first time, that cadherins are dramatically different in their ability to promote intercellular adhesiveness, a finding that has profound implications for the regulation of tissue morphogenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
Asf1 (anti-silencing function 1), a well conserved protein from yeast to humans, acts as a histone chaperone and is predicted to participate in a variety of chromatin-mediated cellular processes. To investigate the physiological role of vertebrate Asf1 in vivo, we generated a conditional Asf1-deficient mutant from chicken DT40 cells. Induction of Asf1 depletion resulted in the accumulation of cells in S phase with decreased DNA replication and increased mitotic aberrancy forming multipolar spindles, leading to cell death. In addition, nascent chromatin in Asf1-depleted cells showed increased nuclease sensitivity, indicating impaired nucleosome assembly during DNA replication. Complementation analyses revealed that the functional domain of Asf1 for cell viability was confined to the N-terminal core domain (amino acids 1-155) that is a binding platform for histones H3/H4, CAF-1p60, and HIRA, whereas Asf1 mutant proteins, abolishing binding abilities with both p60 and HIRA, exhibit no effect on viability. These results together indicate that the vertebrate Asf1 plays a crucial role in replication-coupled chromatin assembly, cell cycle progression, and cellular viability and provide a clue of a possible role in a CAF-1- and HIRA-independent chromatin-modulating process for cell proliferation.

<ABSTRACT>
beta-Catenin, a pivotal component of the Wnt-signaling pathway, binds to and serves as a transcriptional coactivator for the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcriptional activator proteins and for the androgen receptor (AR), a nuclear receptor. Three components of the p160 nuclear receptor coactivator complex, including CARM1, p300/CBP, and GRIP1 (one of the p160 coactivators), bind to and cooperate with beta-catenin to enhance transcriptional activation by TCF/LEF and AR. Here we report that another component of the p160 nuclear receptor coactivator complex, the coiled-coil coactivator (CoCoA), directly binds to and cooperates synergistically with beta-catenin as a coactivator for AR and TCF/LEF. CoCoA uses different domains to bind GRIP1 and beta-catenin, and it uses different domains to transmit the activating signal to the transcription machinery, depending on whether it is bound to GRIP1 or beta-catenin. CoCoA associated specifically with the promoters of transiently transfected and endogenous target genes of TCF/LEF, and reduction of the endogenous CoCoA level decreased the ability of TCF/LEF and beta-catenin to activate transcription of transient and endogenous target genes. Thus, CoCoA uses different combinations of functional domains to serve as a physiologically relevant component of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and the androgen signaling pathway.

<ABSTRACT>
Here, we demonstrated that lactacystin inhibited proteasome dose-dependently in HEK293 cells stably expressing tau. Simultaneously, it induces accumulation of both non-phosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated tau and decreases the binding of tau to the taxol-stabilized microtubules. Lactacystin activates glycogen synthase kinsase-3 (GSK-3) and decreases the phosphorylation of GSK-3 at serine-9. LiCl inhibits GSK-3 and thus reverses the lactacystin-induced accumulation of the phosphorylated tau. Lactacystin also inhibits protein phosphase-2A (PP-2A) and it significantly increases the level of inhibitor 1 of PP-2A. These results suggest that inhibition of proteasome by lactacystin induces tau accumulation and activation of GSK-3 and inhibition of PP-2A are involved.

Translational control by an upstream open reading frame in the HER-2/neu
transcript.

<ABSTRACT>
Overexpression of the HER-2 (neu, erbB-2) receptor results in cellular transformation and is associated with a variety of human cancers. Multiple mechanisms, including gene amplification and transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational controls contribute to the regulation of HER-2 expression. One of the components of these regulatory mechanisms is a short upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the HER-2 mRNA that represses downstream translation in a variety of cell types. Here we explore the mechanism by which this uORF exerts its inhibitory effect. As judged by comparisons of protein and mRNA abundance and by polysomal distribution analyses, the uORF represses translation of the HER-2 cistron or of a heterologous reporter gene. Despite its conservation among mammalian species, the peptide sequence of the uORF is not required for this inhibitory effect. Rather, the majority of ribosomes that load on the HER-2 mRNA most likely translate the uORF and are then unable to reinitiate at the downstream AUG codon, in part due to the short intercistronic spacing. A minority of ribosomes gain access to the HER-2 initiation codon either by leaky scanning past the upstream AUG codon or by reinitiating after having translated the uORF despite the short intercistronic region. These results suggest that the HER-2 uORF controls synthesis of this oncoprotein by limiting ribosomal access to downstream initiation sites.

Mechanistic and functional studies of the interaction of a proline-rich
antimicrobial peptide with mammalian cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Mammalian antimicrobial peptides provide rapid defense against infection by inactivating pathogens and by influencing the functions of cells involved in defense responses. Although the direct antibacterial properties of these peptides have been widely characterized, their multiple effects on host cells are only beginning to surface. Here we investigated the mechanistic and functional aspects of the interaction of the proline-rich antimicrobial peptide Bac7(1-35) with mammalian cells, as compared with a truncated analog, Bac7(5-35), lacking four critical N-terminal residues (RRIR) of the Bac7(1-35) sequence. By using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we showed that although the truncated analog Bac7(5-35) remains on the cell surface, Bac7(1-35) is rapidly taken up into 3T3 and U937 cells through a nontoxic energy- and temperature-dependent process. Cell biology-based assays using selective endocytosis inhibitors and spectroscopic and surface plasmon resonance studies of the interaction of Bac7(1-35) with phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol model membranes collectively suggest the concurrent contribution of macropinocytosis and direct membrane translocation. Structural studies with model membranes indicated that membrane-bound Bac7(5-35) is significantly more aggregated than Bac7(1-35) due to the absence of the N-terminal cationic cluster, thus providing an explanation for hampered cellular internalization of the truncated form. Further investigations aimed to reveal functional implications of intracellular uptake of Bac7(1-35) demonstrated that it correlates with enhanced S phase entry of 3T3 cells, indicating a novel function for this proline-rich peptide.

NR2B tyrosine phosphorylation modulates fear learning as well as
amygdaloid synaptic plasticity.
</TITLE>

<ABSTRACT>
Phosphorylation of neural proteins in response to a diverse array of external stimuli is one of the main mechanisms underlying dynamic changes in neural circuitry. The NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor is tyrosine-phosphorylated in the brain, with Tyr-1472 its major phosphorylation site. Here, we generate mice with a knockin mutation of the Tyr-1472 site to phenylalanine (Y1472F) and show that Tyr-1472 phosphorylation is essential for fear learning and amygdaloid synaptic plasticity. The knockin mice show impaired fear-related learning and reduced amygdaloid long-term potentiation. NMDA receptor-mediated CaMKII signaling is impaired in YF/YF mice. Electron microscopic analyses reveal that the Y1472F mutant of the NR2B subunit shows improper localization at synapses in the amygdala. We thus identify Tyr-1472 phosphorylation as a key mediator of fear learning and amygdaloid synaptic plasticity.

Arachidonic acid regulates the translocation of 5-lipoxygenase to the
nuclear membranes in human neutrophils.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Elevation of the intracellular cAMP concentration in agonist-activated human neutrophils (PMN) leads to the concomitant inhibitions of arachidonic acid (AA) release, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) translocation, and leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis. We report herein that exogenous AA completely prevents cAMP-dependent inhibition of 5-LO translocation and LT biosynthesis in agonist-activated PMN. Moreover, the group IVA phospholipase A2 inhibitor pyrrophenone and the MEK inhibitor U-0126 inhibited AA release and 5-LO translocation in activated PMN, and these effects were also prevented by exogenous AA, demonstrating a functional link between AA release and 5-LO translocation. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of the C18 and C20 series containing at least three double bonds located from carbon 9 (or closer to the carboxyl group) were equally effective as AA in restoring 5-LO translocation in pyrrophenone-treated agonist-activated PMN. Importantly, experiments with the 5-LO-activating protein inhibitor MK-0591 and the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM demonstrated that the AA-regulated 5-LO translocation is FLAP- and Ca2+-dependent. Finally, the redox and competitive 5-LO inhibitors L-685,015, L-739,010, and L-702,539 (but not cyclooxygenase inhibitors) efficiently substituted for AA to reverse the pyrrophenone inhibition of 5-LO translocation, indicating that the site of regulation of 5-LO translocation by AA is at or in the vicinity of the catalytic site. This report demonstrates that AA regulates the translocation of 5-LO in human PMN and unravels a novel mechanism of the cAMP-mediated inhibition of LT biosynthesis.

Lamprey-like gills in a gnathostome-related Devonian jawless vertebrate.

<ABSTRACT>
So far, the Palaeozoic fossil jawless vertebrates have not provided any direct evidence for the organization of the gills, apart from vague impressions--supposedly left by gill filaments--on the bony surface of the gill chamber in certain armoured forms or 'ostracoderms' (for example, osteostracans and heterostracans). The latter are currently regarded as more closely related to the living jawed vertebrates (crown gnathostomes) than to the living jawless vertebrates (hagfish and lampreys, or cyclostomes). Here we report the first direct evidence for the position of the gill filaments--possibly supported by gill rays--enclosed by gill pouches in a 370-million year (Myr)-old jawless vertebrate, Endeiolepis, from the Late Devonian fossil fish site of Miguasha, Quebec, Canada. This extinct jawless fish has much the same gill organization as living lampreys, although it possesses an unusually large number of gill pouches--a condition unlike that in any extant vertebrates and that raises questions about gill development. Endeiolepis is currently regarded as a close relative of anaspids, a group of 410-430-Myr-old 'ostracoderms'. Assuming that current vertebrate phylogeny is correct, this discovery demonstrates that pouches enclosing the gills are primitive for vertebrates, but have been subsequently lost in jawed vertebrates.

Molecular chaperones of the Hsp110 family act as nucleotide exchange
factors of Hsp70s.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Hsp70 molecular chaperones function in protein folding in a manner dependent on regulation by co-chaperones. Hsp40s increase the low intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp70, and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) remove ADP after ATP hydrolysis, enabling a new Hsp70 interaction cycle with non-native protein substrate. Here, we show that members of the Hsp70-related Hsp110 family cooperate with Hsp70 in protein folding in the eukaryotic cytosol. Mammalian Hsp110 and the yeast homologues Sse1p/2p catalyze efficient nucleotide exchange on Hsp70 and its orthologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ssa1p, respectively. Moreover, Sse1p has the same effect on Ssb1p, a ribosome-associated isoform of Hsp70 in yeast. Mutational analysis revealed that the N-terminal ATPase domain and the ultimate C-terminus of Sse1p are required for nucleotide exchange activity. The Hsp110 homologues significantly increase the rate and yield of Hsp70-mediated re-folding of thermally denatured firefly luciferase in vitro. Similarly, deletion of SSE1 causes a firefly luciferase folding defect in yeast cells under heat stress in vivo. Our data indicate that Hsp110 proteins are important components of the eukaryotic Hsp70 machinery of protein folding.

biogenesis in mitochondria.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Formation of iron/sulfur (Fe/S) clusters, protein translocation and protein folding are essential processes in the mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In a systematic approach to characterize essential proteins involved in these processes, we identified a novel essential protein of the mitochondrial matrix, which is highly conserved from yeast to human and which we termed Isd11. Depletion of Isd11 caused a strong reduction in the levels of the Fe/S proteins aconitase and the Rieske protein, and a massive decrease in the enzymatic activities of aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase. Incorporation of iron into the Fe/S protein Leu1 and formation of the Fe/S cluster containing holoform of the mitochondrial ferredoxin Yah1 were inhibited in the absence of Isd11. This strongly suggests that Isd11 is required for the assembly of Fe/S proteins. We show that Isd11 forms a stable complex with Nfs1, the cysteine desulfurase of the mitochondrial machinery for Fe/S cluster assembly. In the absence of Isd11, Nfs1 is prone to aggregation. We propose that Isd11 acts together with Nfs1 in an early step in the biogenesis of Fe/S proteins.

V-ATPase interacts with ARNO and Arf6 in early endosomes and regulates the
protein degradative pathway.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The recruitment of the small GTPase Arf6 and ARNO from cytosol to endosomal membranes is driven by V-ATPase-dependent intra-endosomal acidification. The molecular mechanism that mediates this pH-sensitive recruitment and its role are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Arf6 interacts with the c-subunit, and ARNO with the a2-isoform of V-ATPase. The a2-isoform is targeted to early endosomes, interacts with ARNO in an intra-endosomal acidification-dependent manner, and disruption of this interaction results in reversible inhibition of endocytosis. Inhibition of endosomal acidification abrogates protein trafficking between early and late endosomal compartments. These data demonstrate the crucial role of early endosomal acidification and V-ATPase/ARNO/Arf6 interactions in the regulation of the endocytic degradative pathway. They also indicate that V-ATPase could modulate membrane trafficking by recruiting and interacting with ARNO and Arf6; characteristics that are consistent with the role of V-ATPase as an essential component of the endosomal pH-sensing machinery.

ClC-7 requires Ostm1 as a beta-subunit to support bone resorption and
lysosomal function.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Mutations in ClC-7, a late endosomal/lysosomal member of the CLC family of chloride channels and transporters, cause osteopetrosis and lysosomal storage disease in humans and mice. Severe osteopetrosis is also observed with mutations in the OSTM1 gene, which encodes a membrane protein of unknown function. Here we show that both ClC-7 and Ostm1 proteins co-localize in late endosomes and lysosomes of various tissues, as well as in the ruffled border of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Co-immunoprecipitations show that ClC-7 and Ostm1 form a molecular complex and suggest that Ostm1 is a beta-subunit of ClC-7. ClC-7 is required for Ostm1 to reach lysosomes, where the highly glycosylated Ostm1 luminal domain is cleaved. Protein but not RNA levels of ClC-7 are greatly reduced in grey-lethal mice, which lack Ostm1, suggesting that the ClC-7-Ostm1 interaction is important for protein stability. As ClC-7 protein levels in Ostm1-deficient tissues and cells, including osteoclasts, are decreased below 10% of normal levels, Ostm1 mutations probably cause osteopetrosis by impairing the acidification of the osteoclast resorption lacuna, which depends on ClC-7 (ref. 3). The finding that grey-lethal mice, just like ClC-7-deficient mice, show lysosomal storage and neurodegeneration in addition to osteopetrosis implies a more general importance for ClC-7-Ostm1 complexes.

TRPM7, a novel regulator of actomyosin contractility and cell adhesion.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Actomyosin contractility regulates various cell biological processes including cytokinesis, adhesion and migration. While in lower eukaryotes, alpha-kinases control actomyosin relaxation, a similar role for mammalian alpha-kinases has yet to be established. Here, we examined whether TRPM7, a cation channel fused to an alpha-kinase, can affect actomyosin function. We demonstrate that activation of TRPM7 by bradykinin leads to a Ca(2+)- and kinase-dependent interaction with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Moreover, TRPM7 phosphorylates the myosin IIA heavy chain. Accordingly, low overexpression of TRPM7 increases intracellular Ca2+ levels accompanied by cell spreading, adhesion and the formation of focal adhesions. Activation of TRPM7 induces the transformation of these focal adhesions into podosomes by a kinase-dependent mechanism, an effect that can be mimicked by pharmacological inhibition of myosin II. Collectively, our results demonstrate that regulation of cell adhesion by TRPM7 is the combined effect of kinase-dependent and -independent pathways on actomyosin contractility.

<ABSTRACT>
CLIP-170 is a microtubule 'plus end tracking' protein involved in several microtubule-dependent processes in interphase. At the onset of mitosis, CLIP-170 localizes to kinetochores, but at metaphase, it is no longer detectable at kinetochores. Although RNA interference (RNAi) experiments have suggested an essential role for CLIP-170 during mitosis, the molecular function of CLIP-170 in mitosis has not yet been revealed. Here, we used a combination of high-resolution microscopy and RNAi-mediated depletion to study the function of CLIP-170 in mitosis. We found that CLIP-170 dynamically localizes to the outer most part of unattached kinetochores and to the ends of growing microtubules. In addition, we provide evidence that a pool of CLIP-170 is transported along kinetochore-microtubules by the dynein/dynactin complex. Interference with CLIP-170 expression results in defective chromosome congression and diminished kinetochore-microtubule attachments, but does not detectibly affect microtubule dynamics or kinetochore-microtubule stability. Taken together, our results indicate that CLIP-170 facilitates the formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments, possibly through direct capture of microtubules at the kinetochore.

Interaction with Grb14 results in site-specific regulation of tyrosine
phosphorylation of the insulin receptor.

<ABSTRACT>
The dynamics of interaction of the insulin receptor (IR) with Grb14 was monitored, in real time, in living human embryonic kidney cells, using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). We observed that insulin rapidly and dose-dependently stimulated this interaction. We also observed that insulin-induced BRET between the IR and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was markedly reduced by Grb14, suggesting that Grb14 regulated this interaction in living cells. Using site-specific antibodies against phosphorylated tyrosines of the IR, we showed that Grb14 protected the three tyrosines of the kinase loop from dephosphorylation by PTP1B, while favouring dephosphorylation of tyrosine 972. This resulted in decreased IRS-1 binding to the IR and decreased activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Increased Grb14 expression in human liver-derived HuH7 cells also seemed to specifically decrease the phosphorylation of Y972. Our work therefore suggests that Grb14 may regulate signalling through the IR by controlling its tyrosine dephosphorylation in a site-specific manner.

<ABSTRACT>
The G-protein regulatory (GPR) motif is a approximately 25 amino acid sequence that stabilizes the GDP-bound conformation of Gialpha. To identify additional GPR motifs, we expanded a motif-based search strategy and identified an additional 4 mammalian proteins (WAVE1-3, rat GHRH) and 10 plant proteins with candidate GPR motifs. The WAVE1 GPR peptide inhibited GTPgammaS binding to purified G-protein. Endogenous Gialpha and WAVE1 coimmunoprecipitated from brain lysates. A WAVE1-G-protein complex was also observed following transfection of COS7 cells with Gialpha3 and WAVE1. The docking of Gialpha within a WAVE1 scaffolding complex may facilitate dynamic cycling and/or targeting for efficient and localized control of actin polymerization.

<ABSTRACT>
The expression of metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) correlates well with tumor metastases; however, the associated molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we explored the possibility of cross-talk between MTA1 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a key regulator of angiogenic factors. We observed that the expression of MTA1 was strongly induced under hypoxia in breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. When MTA1 was overexpressed, the transcriptional activity and stability of HIF-1alpha protein were enhanced. MTA1 and HIF-1alpha are physically associated in vivo and they were localized completely in the nucleus when coexpressed. MTA1 induced the deacetylation of HIF-1alpha by increasing the expression of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). MTA1 counteracted to the action of acetyltransferase, ARD1, and it did not stabilize the HIF-1alpha mutant that lacks the acetylation site, K532R. These results indicate that acetylation is the major target of MTA1/HDAC1 function. Collectively, our data provide evidence of a positive cross-talk between HIF-1alpha and MTA1, which is mediated by HDAC1 recruitment, and indicate a close connection between MTA1-associated metastasis and HIF-1-induced tumor angiogenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
The consequences of human RNA polymerase II (pol II) arrest at the site of DNA damaged by cisplatin were studied in whole cells and cell extracts, with a particular focus on the stability of stalled pol II and its subsequent ubiquitylation. Site-specifically platinated DNA templates immobilized on a solid support were used to perform in vitro transcription in HeLa nuclear extracts. RNA elongation was completely blocked by a cisplatin intrastrand cross-link. The stalled polymerase was quite stable, remaining on the DNA template in nuclear extracts. The stability of pol II stalled at the site of cisplatin damage was also observed in live cells. A cell fractionation experiment using cisplatin-treated HeLa cells revealed an increased level of chromatin-associated pol II proteins following DNA damage. The stalled polymerase was transcriptionally active and capable of elongating the transcript following chemical removal of platinum from the template. Transcription inhibition by alpha-amanitin in vitro enhanced pol II ubiquitylation at ubiquitin residues Lys-6, Lys-48, and Lys-63. In live cells expressing epitope-tagged ubiquitin mutants, several ubiquitin lysines also participated in pol II ubiquitylation following DNA damage. Cisplatin treatment triggered ubiquitylation-mediated pol II degradation in HeLa cells, which could be prevented by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. Fractionation of pol II from cells co-treated with MG132 and cisplatin indicated that the undegraded ubiquitylated polymerase was mostly unbound or only loosely associated with chromatin. These data are consistent with a model in which only a fraction of pol II, ubiquitylated in response to cisplatin damage of DNA, dissociates from the sites of platination. This altered polymerase is rapidly destroyed by proteasomes.

<ABSTRACT>
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-chromosome-linked immunodeficiency disorder. The most common symptom seen in WAS patients is bleeding. One of the main causes of bleeding is defective platelet aggregation. The causative gene of WAS encodes WAS protein (WASP). Here, we show that WASP binds to the calcium- and integrin-binding protein (CIB) in platelets. CIB was originally identified as a protein binding to the alphaIIb cytoplasmic tail of platelet integrin alphaIIb beta3, which has a primary role in platelet aggregation. We also show that the WASP-CIB complex is important in alphaIIb beta3-mediated cell adhesion, and that in patients mutant forms of WASP are expressed at reduced levels or show lower affinities for CIB than wild-type WASP. Our results indicate that impaired complex formation between mutant WASPs and CIB reduces alphaIIb beta3-mediated cell adhesion and causes defective platelet aggregation, resulting in bleeding.

<ABSTRACT>
Connexin hemichannels have been proposed as a diffusion pathway for the release of extracellular messengers like ATP and others, based on connexin expression models and inhibition by gap junction blockers. Hemichannels are opened by various experimental stimuli, but the physiological intracellular triggers are currently not known. We investigated the hypothesis that an increase of cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) triggers hemichannel opening, making use of peptides that are identical to a short amino-acid sequence on the connexin subunit to specifically block hemichannels, but not gap junction channels. Our work performed on connexin 32 (Cx32)-expressing cells showed that an increase in [Ca2+]i triggers ATP release and dye uptake that is dependent on Cx32 expression, blocked by Cx32 (but not Cx43) mimetic peptides and a calmodulin antagonist, and critically dependent on [Ca2+]i elevation within a window situated around 500 nM. Our results indicate that [Ca2+]i elevation triggers hemichannel opening, and suggest that these channels are under physiological control.

<ABSTRACT>
The cyanobacterial circadian clock can be reconstituted in vitro by mixing recombinant KaiA, KaiB and KaiC proteins with ATP, producing KaiC phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycles that have a regular rhythm with a ca. 24-h period and are temperature-compensated. KaiA and KaiB are modulators of KaiC phosphorylation, whereby KaiB antagonizes KaiA's action. Here, we present a complete crystallographic model of the Synechococcus elongatus KaiC hexamer that includes previously unresolved portions of the C-terminal regions, and a negative-stain electron microscopy study of S. elongatus and Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 KaiA-KaiC complexes. Site-directed mutagenesis in combination with EM reveals that KaiA binds exclusively to the CII half of the KaiC hexamer. The EM-based model of the KaiA-KaiC complex reveals protein-protein interactions at two sites: the known interaction of the flexible C-terminal KaiC peptide with KaiA, and a second postulated interaction between the apical region of KaiA and the ATP binding cleft on KaiC. This model brings KaiA mutation sites that alter clock period or abolish rhythmicity into contact with KaiC and suggests how KaiA might regulate KaiC phosphorylation.

death.

<ABSTRACT>
Bacterial speck disease in tomato is caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. Resistance to this disease is conferred by the host Pto kinase, which recognizes P. s. pv. tomato strains that express the effector AvrPto. We report here that an AvrPto-dependent Pto-interacting protein 3 (Adi3) is a member of the AGC family of protein kinases. In mammals, AGC kinases are regulated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1). We characterized tomato Pdk1 and showed that Pdk1 and Pto phosphorylate Adi3. Gene silencing of Adi3 in tomato causes MAPKKKalpha-dependent formation of necrotic lesions. Use of a chemical inhibitor of Pdk1, OSU-03012, also implicates Pdk1 and Adi3 in plant cell death regulation. Adi3 thus appears to function analogously to the mammalian AGC kinase protein kinase B/Akt by negatively regulating cell death via Pdk1 phosphorylation. We speculate that the negative regulatory function of Adi3 might be subverted by interaction with Pto/AvrPto, leading to host cell death that is associated with pathogen attack.

Interleukin-1beta induction of NFkappaB is partially regulated by
H2O2-mediated activation of NFkappaB-inducing kinase.
</TITLE>

<ABSTRACT>
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been demonstrated to act as second messengers in a number of signal transduction pathways, including NFkappaB. However, the mechanism(s) by which ROS regulate NFkappaB remain unclear and controversial. In the present report, we describe a mechanism whereby interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) stimulation of NFkappaB is partially regulated by H2O2-mediated activation of NIK and subsequent NIK-mediated phosphorylation of IKKalpha. IL-1beta induced H2O2 production in MCF-7 cells and clearance of this ROS through the expression of GPx-1 reduced NFkappaB transcriptional activation by inhibiting NIK-mediated phosphorylation of IKKalpha. Although IKKalpha and IKKbeta were both involved in IL-1beta-mediated activation of NFkappaB, only the IKKalpha-dependent component was modulated by changes in H2O2 levels. Interestingly, in vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrated that NIK was activated by a very narrow range of H2O2 (1-10 microM), whereas higher concentrations (100 microM to 1 mM) inhibited NIK activity. Treatment of cells with the general Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor (okadaic acid) lead to activation of NFkappaB and enhanced NIK activity as a IKKalpha kinase, suggesting that ROS may directly regulate NIK through the inhibition of phosphatases. Recruitment of NIK to TRAF6 following IL-1beta stimulation was inhibited by H2O2 clearance and Rac1 siRNA, suggesting that Rac-dependent NADPH oxidase may be a source of ROS required for NIK activation. In summary, our studies have demonstrated that redox regulation of NIK by H2O2 is mechanistically important in IL-1beta induction of NFkappaB activation.

Notch3 and pre-TCR interaction unveils distinct NF-kappaB pathways in
T-cell development and leukemia.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Notch signaling plays a critical role in T-cell differentiation and leukemogenesis. We previously demonstrated that, while pre-TCR is required for thymocytes proliferation and leukemogenesis, it is dispensable for thymocyte differentiation in Notch3-transgenic mice. Notch3-transgenic premalignant thymocytes and T lymphoma cells overexpress pTalpha/pre-TCR and display constitutive activation of NF-kappaB, providing survival signals for immature thymocytes. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence that Notch3 triggers multiple NF-kappaB activation pathways. A pre-TCR-dependent pathway preferentially activates NF-kappaB via IKKbeta/IKKalpha/NIK complex, resulting in p50/p65 heterodimer nuclear entry and recruitment onto promoters of Cyclin D1, Bcl2-A1 and IL7-receptor-alpha genes. In contrast, upon pTalpha deletion, Notch3 binds IKKalpha and maintains NF-kappaB activation through an alternative pathway, depending on an NIK-independent IKKalpha homodimer activity. The consequent NF-kappaB2/p100 processing allows nuclear translocation of p52/RelB heterodimers, which only trigger transcription from Bcl2-A1 and IL7-receptor-alpha genes. Our data suggest that a finely tuned interplay between Notch3 and pre-TCR pathways converges on regulation of NF-kappaB activity, leading to differential NF-kappaB subunit dimerization that regulates distinct gene clusters involved in either cell differentiation or proliferation/leukemogenesis.

Rad3-Cds1 mediates coupling of initiation of meiotic recombination with
DNA replication. Mei4-dependent transcription as a potential target of
meiotic checkpoint.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Premeiotic S-phase and meiotic recombination are known to be strictly coupled in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the checkpoint pathway regulating this coupling has been largely unknown. In fission yeast, Rad3 is known to play an essential role in coordination of DNA replication and cell division during both mitotic growth and meiosis. Here we have examined whether the Rad3 pathway also regulates the coupling of DNA synthesis and recombination. Inhibition of premeiotic S-phase with hydroxyurea completely abrogates the progression of meiosis, including the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSB formation is restored in rad3 mutant even in the presence of hydroxyurea, although repair of DSBs does not take place or is significantly delayed, indicating that the subsequent recombination steps may be still inhibited. Examination of the roles of downstream checkpoint kinases reveals that Cds1, but not Chk1 or Mek1, is required for suppression of DSB in the presence of hydroxyurea. Transcriptional induction of some rec+ genes essential for DSB occurs at a normal timing and to a normal level in the absence of DNA synthesis in both the wild-type and cds1delta cells. On the other hand, the transcriptional induction of the mei4+ transcription factor and cdc25+ phosphatase, which is significantly suppressed by hydroxyurea in the wild-type cells, occurs almost to a normal level in cds1delta cells even in the presence of hydroxyurea. These results show that the Rad3-Cds1 checkpoint pathway coordinates initiation of meiotic recombination and meiotic cell divisions with premeiotic DNA synthesis. Because mei4+ is known to be required for DSB formation and cdc25+ is required for activation of meiotic cell divisions, we propose an intriguing possibility that the Rad3-Cds1 meiotic checkpoint pathway may target transcription of these factors.

<ABSTRACT>
Tumor endothelial marker 7 (TEM7) is a novel transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in the tumor endothelium. However, the ligands and functions of TEM7 are unknown at present. Using a recombinant ectodomain of TEM7 as a probe, we could identify the saturable interaction between nidogen and TEM7 in vitro. A cell overlay binding assay showed that recombinant nidogen interact with full length TEM7 on cell surface. Finally, nidogen/TEM7 interaction enhanced cell spreading in TEM7 transfected 293T cells. This novel nidogen/TEM7 interaction may provide an important molecular tool with potential therapeutic applications in the anti-angiogenic therapies.

<ABSTRACT>
Phosphoinositides participate in many signaling cascades via phospholipase C stimulation, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, producing second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). Destructive chemical approaches required to measure [InsP3] limit spatiotemporal understanding of subcellular InsP3 signaling. We constructed novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based InsP3 biosensors called FIRE (fluorescent InsP3-responsive element) by fusing plasmids encoding the InsP3-binding domain of InsP3 receptors (types 1-3) between cyan fluorescent protein and yellow fluorescent protein sequences. FIRE was expressed and characterized in COS-1 cells, cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes, and incorporated into an adenoviral vector for expression in adult cardiac ventricular myocytes. FIRE-1 exhibits an approximately 11% increase in the fluorescence ratio (F530/F480) at saturating [InsP3] (apparent K(d) = 31.3 +/- 6.7 nm InsP3). In COS-1 cells, neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and adult cat ventricular myocytes FIRE-1 exhibited comparable dynamic range and a 10% increase in donor (cyan fluorescent protein) fluorescence upon bleach of yellow fluorescent protein, indicative of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. In FIRE-1 expressing ventricular myocytes endothelin-1, phenylephrine, and angiotensin II all produced rapid and spatially resolved increases in [InsP3] using confocal microscopy (with free [InsP3] rising to approximately 30 nm). Local entry of intracellular InsP3 via membrane rupture by a patch pipette (containing InsP3)in myocytes expressing FIRE-1 allowed detailed spatiotemporal monitoring of intracellular InsP3 diffusion. Both endothelin-1-induced and direct InsP3 application (via pipette rupture) revealed that InsP3 diffusion into the nucleus occurs with a delay and blunted rise of [InsP3] versus cytosolic [InsP3]. These new biosensors allow studying InsP3 dynamics at high temporal and spatial resolution that will be powerful in under-standing InsP3 signaling in intact cells.

Interplay between human DNA repair proteins at a unique double-strand
break in vivo.

<ABSTRACT>
DNA repair by homologous recombination is essential for preserving genomic integrity. The RAD51 paralogs (RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2 and XRCC3) play important roles in this process. In this study, we show that human RAD51 interacts with RAD51C-XRCC3 or RAD51B-C-D-XRCC2. In addition to being critical for RAD51 focus formation, RAD51C localizes to DNA damage sites. Inhibition of RAD51C results in a decrease in cellular proliferation consistent with a role in repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) that occur naturally. To monitor a single DNA repair event, we developed immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) methods on human cells where a unique DSB can be created in vivo. Using this system, we observed a single focus of RAD51C, RAD51 and 53BP1, which colocalized with gamma-H2AX. ChIPs revealed that endogenous human RAD51, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, XRCC3 and MRE11 proteins are recruited in the S-G2 phase of the cell cycle, while Ku80 is recruited during G1. We propose that RAD51C ensures a tight regulation of RAD51 assembly during DSB repair and plays a direct role in repairing DSBs in vivo.

ARE-mRNA degradation requires the 5'-3' decay pathway.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
As an important mode of suppressing gene expression, messenger RNAs containing an AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3' untranslated region are rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm. ARE-mediated mRNA decay (AMD) is initiated by deadenylation, and in vitro studies have indicated that subsequent degradation occurs in the 3'-5' direction through a complex of exonucleases termed the exosome. An alternative pathway of mRNA degradation occurs at processing bodies, cytoplasmic foci that contain decapping enzymes, the 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn1 and the Lsm1-7 heptamer. To determine which of the two pathways is important for AMD in live cells, we targeted components of both pathways using short interfering RNA in human HT1080 cells. We show that Xrn1 and Lsm1 are essential for AMD. On the other side, out of three exosome components tested, only knockdown of PmScl-75 caused a strong inhibition of AMD. Our results show that mammalian cells, similar to yeast, require the 5'-3' Xrn1 pathway to degrade ARE-mRNAs.

Redundancy of non-AUG initiators. A clever mechanism to enhance the
efficiency of translation in yeast.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
It was recently shown that ALA1, the only alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, uses two successive ACG triplets as the translation initiators for its mitochondrial form. Evidence presented here argues that the second ACG triplet not only acts as a remedial initiation site for scanning ribosomes that skip the first ACG, but also enhances the activity of the preceding initiator by providing a preferable "A" at its relative position +4. Therefore, ALA1 constructs with redundant ACG initiators exhibit stronger complementing activity and express a higher level of protein than do those with a single ACG initiator. A similar scenario is seen when a single or redundant ACG triplets are placed in the positions of the first and second AUG initiators of VAS1, which serve as the start sites of the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic forms of valyl-tRNA synthetase, respectively. Cumulatively, the results suggest that this feature of redundancy of non-AUG initiators in a single mRNA per se may represent a novel paradigm for improving the efficiency of a poor or otherwise nonproductive initiation event.

erbB1 functions as a sensor of airway epithelial integrity by regulation
of protein phosphatase 2A activity.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Two enzymes, protein phosphatase 2A and atypical protein kinase C, are associated with the tight junction and regulate its function. For example, phosphorylation of the tight junction protein occludin is required for its incorporation into the junction. The association of a kinase and phosphatase with the tight junction suggests that a balance between their activities exists and is required for normal tight junction function. This hypothesis predicts that loss of epithelial integrity may disrupt this balance in such a way as to facilitate restoration of epithelial integrity. Our previous data have shown that apically localized growth factors segregate from their basolaterally localized erbB receptors. Loss of epithelial integrity allows ligand access to the basolateral membrane where it immediately binds to and activates erbB receptors. We found that activation of erbB1 leads to phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 2A, inhibiting its activity. Importantly, this phosphorylation event was dependent on factors in the overlying airway surface liquid; washing away this liquid prevented phosphorylation. erbB1-mediated inhibition of phosphatase activity would shift the balance in favor of the kinase such that tight junction proteins would regain their phosphorylation, allowing for their incorporation into the junction complex. This mechanism provides a rapid means of sensing the loss of epithelial integrity and subsequently restoring barrier function.

<ABSTRACT>
Patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) die because of chemoresistance. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) increases the expression of antiapoptotic proteins, XIAP and Bcl-X(L), and triggers chemoresistance in SCLC cells. Here we show that these effects are mediated through the formation of a specific multiprotein complex comprising B-Raf, PKCepsilon and S6K2. S6K1, Raf-1 and other PKC isoforms do not form similar complexes. RNAi-mediated downregulation of B-Raf, PKCepsilon or S6K2 abolishes FGF-2-mediated survival. In contrast, overexpression of PKCepsilon increases XIAP and Bcl-X(L) levels and chemoresistance in SCLC cells. In a tetracycline-inducible system, increased S6K2 kinase activity triggers upregulation of XIAP, Bcl-X(L) and prosurvival effects. However, increased S6K1 kinase activity has no such effect. Thus, S6K2 but not S6K1 mediates prosurvival/chemoresistance signalling.

Inhibition of ERK-MAP kinase signaling by RSK during Drosophila
development.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Although p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) is known as an important downstream effector of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Ras/ERK) pathway, its endogenous role, and precise molecular function remain unclear. Using gain-of-function and null mutants of RSK, its physiological role was successfully characterized in Drosophila. Surprisingly, RSK-null mutants were viable, but exhibited developmental abnormalities related to an enhanced ERK-dependent cellular differentiation such as ectopic photoreceptor- and vein-cell formation. Conversely, overexpression of RSK dramatically suppressed the ERK-dependent differentiation, which was further augmented by mutations in the Ras/ERK pathway. Consistent with these physiological phenotypes, RSK negatively regulated ERK-mediated developmental processes and gene expressions by blocking the nuclear localization of ERK in a kinase activity-independent manner. In addition, we further demonstrated that the RSK-dependent inhibition of ERK nuclear migration is mediated by the physical association between ERK and RSK. Collectively, our study reveals a novel regulatory mechanism of the Ras/ERK pathway by RSK, which negatively regulates ERK activity by acting as a cytoplasmic anchor in Drosophila.

<ABSTRACT>
Small carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase 2 (SCP2) was identified and verified as a protein that interacts with the androgen receptor (AR). Ectopic expression of SCP2 or two other family members, SCP1 and SCP3, attenuated AR transcriptional activity in LNCaP cells and were recruited in an androgen- and AR-dependent fashion onto the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter. Silencing SCP2 and SCP1 by short hairpin RNAs increased androgen-dependent transcription of the PSA gene and augmented AR loading onto the PSA promoter and enhancer. SCP2 also attenuated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function, and its silencing increased dexamethasone-mediated PSA mRNA accumulation and GR loading onto the PSA enhancer in LNCaP 1F5 cells. SCP2 silencing was accompanied by augmented recruitment and earlier cycling of RNA polymerase II on the promoter. Ser 5 phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II CTD, a process necessary for initiation of transcription elongation, occurred significantly earlier in SCP2-silenced than parental LNCaP cells. Collectively, our results suggest that SCP2 is involved in promoter clearance during steroid-activated transcription.

<ABSTRACT>
BRCA1 is a checkpoint and DNA damage repair gene that secures genome integrity. We have previously shown that mice lacking full-length Brca1 (Brca1(delta11/delta11)) die during embryonic development. Haploid loss of p53 completely rescues embryonic lethality, and adult Brca1(delta11/delta11)p53+/- mice display cancer susceptibility and premature aging. Here, we show that reduced expression and/or the absence of Chk2 allow Brca1(delta11/delta11) mice to escape from embryonic lethality. Compared to Brca1(delta11/delta11)p53+/- mice, lifespan of Brca1(delta11/delta11)Chk2-/- mice was remarkably extended. Analysis of Brca1(delta11/delta11)Chk2-/- mice revealed that p53-dependent apoptosis and growth defect caused by Brca1 deficiency are significantly attenuated in rapidly proliferating organs. However, in later life, Brca1(delta11/delta11)Chk2-/- female mice developed multiple tumors. Furthermore, haploid loss of ATM also rescued Brca1 deficiency-associated embryonic lethality and premature aging. Thus, in response to Brca1 deficiency, the activation of the ATM-Chk2-p53 signaling pathway contributes to the suppression of neoplastic transformation, while leading to compromised organismal homeostasis. Our data highlight how accurate maintenance of genomic integrity is critical for the suppression of both aging and malignancy, and provide a further link between aging and cancer.

Distinct roles for Sld3 and GINS during establishment and progression of
eukaryotic DNA replication forks.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Cdc45 protein is crucial for the initiation of chromosome replication in eukaryotic cells, as it allows the activation of prereplication complexes (pre-RCs) that contain the MCM helicase. This causes the unwinding of origins and the establishment of DNA replication forks. The incorporation of Cdc45 at nascent forks is a highly regulated and poorly understood process that requires, in budding yeast, the Sld3 protein and the GINS complex. Previous studies suggested that Sld3 is also important for the progression of DNA replication forks after the initiation step, as are Cdc45 and GINS. In contrast, we show here that Sld3 does not move with DNA replication forks and only associates with MCM in an unstable manner before initiation. After the establishment of DNA replication forks from early origins, Sld3 is no longer essential for the completion of chromosome replication. Unlike Sld3, GINS is not required for the initial recruitment of Cdc45 to origins and instead is necessary for stable engagement of Cdc45 with the nascent replisome. Like Cdc45, GINS then associates stably with MCM during S-phase.

Expression of Mouse Abcg2 mRNA during Hematopoiesis Is Regulated by
Alternative Use of Multiple Leader Exons and Promoters.

<ABSTRACT>
ABCG2 encodes a transmembrane transporter associated with multidrug resistance in various cancer cells. ABCG2 is also highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and is down-regulated in most committed progenitors, whereas expression is sharply up-regulated during erythroid differentiation. The mechanisms for regulation of ABCG2 expression in hematopoietic cells are poorly understood. We have recently identified three novel leader exons (termed E1A, E1B, and E1C) located in the 5'-untranslated region of mouse Abcg2 mRNA by data base searches and reverse transcription-PCR. In a mouse erythroid cell line, reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that the transcript containing E1B exon was the only isoform detected. Consistently, the E1B-containing transcript was the predominant isoform of Abcg2 mRNA in primary Ter119+ erythroid cells from mouse bone marrow as well as in mouse fetal liver cells. In contrast, the E1A-containing transcript was highly expressed in c-Kit+, Sca-1+, Lin- (KSL) bone marrow cells, especially in CD34- KSL fraction, which is highly enriched for repopulating HSCs. The differential expression pattern of Abcg2 mRNA isoforms in mouse HSCs and erythroid cells was confirmed by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, indicating that at least two different promoters control mouse Abcg2 transcription during hematopoiesis. Promoter functional assays using EGFP as reporter gene demonstrated that the E1A 5'-flanking region had promoter activity, which contains multiple putative hematopoietic transcription factor binding sites. In summary, our data show that the expression of Abcg2 during hematopoiesis is transcriptionally regulated by alternative use of multiple leader exons and promoters in a developmental stage-specific manner.

The ST6GalNAc-I sialyltransferase localizes throughout the Golgi and is

in human breast cancer.

NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The functional properties of glycoproteins are strongly influenced by their profile of glycosylation, and changes in this profile are seen in malignancy. In mucin-type O-linked glycosylation these changes can result in the production of mucins such as MUC1, carrying shorter sialylated O-glycans, and with different site occupancy. Of the tumor-associated sialylated O-glycans, the disaccharide, sialyl-Tn (sialic acid alpha2,6GalNAc), is expressed by 30% of breast carcinomas and is the most tumor-specific. The ST6GalNAc-I glycosyltransferase, which can catalyze the transfer of sialic acid to GalNAc, shows a highly restricted pattern of expression in normal adult tissues, being largely limited to the gastrointestinal tract and absent in mammary gland. In breast carcinomas, however, a complete correlation between the expression of RNA-encoding ST6GalNAc-I and the expression of sialyl-Tn is evident, demonstrating that the expression of sialyl-Tn results from switching on expression of hST6GalNAc-I. Endogenous or exogenous expression of hST6GalNAc-I (but not ST6GalNAc-II) always results in the expression of sialyl-Tn. This ability to override core 1/core 2 pathways of O- linked glycosylation is explained by the localization of ST6GalNAc-I, which is found throughout the Golgi stacks. The development of a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line expressing MUC1 and ST6GalNAc-I allowed the large scale production of MUC1 carrying 83% sialyl-Tn O-glycans. The presence of ST6GalNAc-I in the CHO cells reduced the number of O-glycosylation sites occupied in MUC1, from an average of 4.3 to 3.8 per tandem repeat. The availability of large quantities of this MUC1 glycoform will allow the evaluation of its efficacy as an immunogen for immunotherapy of MUC1/STn-expressing tumors.

<ABSTRACT>
A trimeric protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A(T55)) composed of the catalytic (PP2Ac), structural (PR65/A), and regulatory (PR55/B) subunits was isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle by thiophosphorylase affinity chromatography, and contained two additional proteins of 54 and 55 kDa, respectively. The 54 kDa protein was identified as eukaryotic translation termination factor 1 (eRF1) and as a PP2A interacting protein. The 55 kDa protein is now identified as nucleoredoxin (NRX). The formation of a complex between GST-NRX, PP2A(C) and PP2A(D) was demonstrated by pull-down experiments with purified forms of PP2A, and by immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged NRX expressed in HEK293 cells complexed endogenous PP2A subunits. Analysis of PP2A activity in the presence of GST-NRX showed that NRX competed with polycations for both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on different forms of PP2A.

<ABSTRACT>
SRY-related HMG box-containing factor 10 (SOX10) is a transcription factor essential for neural crest development and differentiation, and involved in Waardenburg syndrome type IV and PCWH syndrome. Here we show that the SOX10 protein is modified by sumoylation, a highly dynamic post-translational modification that affects stability, activity and localisation of some specific transcription factors. Three sumoylation consensus sites were found in the SOX10 protein, all of them are functional and modulate SOX10 activity. Sumoylation does not affect SOX10 sub-cellular localisation, but represses its transcriptional activity on two of its target genes, GJB1 and MITF, and modulates its synergy with its cofactors EGR2 and PAX3 on these promoters.

Glycosphingolipid-facilitated membrane insertion and internalization of

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cobra cardiotoxins, a family of basic polypeptides having lipid- and heparin-binding capacities similar to the cell-penetrating peptides, induce severe tissue necrosis and systolic heart arrest in snakebite victims. Whereas cardiotoxins are specifically retained on the cell surface via heparan sulfate-mediated processes, their lipid binding ability appears to be responsible, at least in part, for cardiotoxin-induced membrane leakage and cell death. Although the exact role of lipids involved in toxin-mediated cytotoxicity remains largely unknown, monoclonal anti-sulfatide antibody O4 has recently been shown to inhibit the action of CTX A3, the major cardiotoxin from Taiwan cobra venom, on cardiomyocytes by preventing cardiotoxin-induced membrane leakage and CTX A3 internalization into mitochondria. Here, we show that anti-sulfatide acts by blocking the binding of CTX A3 to the sulfatides in the plasma membrane to prevent sulfatide-dependent CTX A3 membrane pore formation and internalization. We also describe the crystal structure of a CTX A3-sulfatide complex in a membrane-like environment at 2.3 angstroms resolution. The unexpected orientation of the sulfatide fatty chains in the structure allows prediction of the mode of toxin insertion into the plasma membrane. CTX A3 recognizes both the headgroup and the ceramide interfacial region of sulfatide to induce a lipid conformational change that may play a key role in CTX A3 oligomerization and cellular internalization. This proposed lipid-mediated toxin translocation mechanism may also shed light on the cellular uptake mechanism of the amphiphilic cell-penetrating peptides known to involve multiple internalization pathways.

The 20S proteasome processes NF-kappaB1 p105 into p50 in a
translation-independent manner.
</TITLE>

<ABSTRACT>
The NF-kappaB p50 is the N-terminal processed product of the precursor, p105. It has been suggested that p50 is generated not from full-length p105 but cotranslationally from incompletely synthesized molecules by the proteasome. We show that the 20S proteasome endoproteolytically cleaves the fully synthesized p105 and selectively degrades the C-terminus of p105, leading to p50 generation in a ubiquitin-independent manner. As small as 25 residues C-terminus to the site of processing are sufficient to promote processing in vivo. However, any p105 mutant that lacks complete ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) is processed aberrantly, suggesting that native processing must occur from a precursor, which extends beyond the ARD. Remarkably, the mutant p105 that lacks the internal region including the glycine-rich region (GRR) is completely degraded by 20S proteasome in vitro. This suggests that the GRR impedes the complete degradation of the p105 precursor, thus contributing to p50 generation.

XpsE oligomerization triggered by ATP binding, not hydrolysis, leads to
its association with XpsL.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
GspE belongs to a secretion NTPase superfamily, members of which are involved in type II/IV secretion, type IV pilus biogenesis and DNA transport in conjugation or natural transformation. Predicted to be a cytoplasmic protein, GspE has nonetheless been shown to be membrane-associated by interacting with the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GspL. By taking biochemical and genetic approaches, we observed that ATP binding triggers oligomerization of Xanthomonas campestris XpsE (a GspE homolog) as well as its association with the N-terminal domain of XpsL (a GspL homolog). While isolated XpsE exhibits very low intrinsic ATPase activity, association with XpsL appears to stimulate ATP hydrolysis. Mutation at a conserved lysine residue in the XpsE Walker A motif causes reduction in its ATPase activity without significantly influencing its interaction with XpsL, congruent with the notion that XpsE-XpsL association precedes ATP hydrolysis. For the first time, functional significance of ATP binding to GspE in type II secretion system is clearly demonstrated. The implications may also be applicable to type IV pilus biogenesis.

Immunization in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy: counteracting
deposition by immunization with a Y78F TTR mutant.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The mechanism of amyloid formation in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP), a hereditary disorder associated with mutant transthyretin (TTR), is still unknown. It is generally believed that altered conformations exposing cryptic regions are intermediary steps in this mechanism. A TTR mutant--Y78F (transthyretin mutant with phenylalanine replacing tyrosine at position 78)--designed to destabilize the native structure has been shown to expose a cryptic epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody that reacts only with highly amyloidogenic mutants presenting the amyloid fold or with amyloid fibrils. To test whether TTR deposition in FAP can be counteracted by antibodies for cryptic epitopes, we immunized with TTR Y78F, transgenic mice carrying the most common FAP-associated TTR mutant--V30M (transthyretin mutant with methionine replacing valine at position 30)--at selected ages that present normally with either nonfibrillar or TTR amyloid deposition. Compared to age-matched control nonimmunized mice, Y78F-immunized mice had a significant reduction in TTR deposition usually found in this strain, in particular in stomach and intestine; by contrast, animals immunized with V30M did not show differences in deposition in comparison with nonimmunized mice. Immunohistochemical analyses of tissues revealed that immunization with Y78F lead to infiltration by lymphocytes and macrophages at common deposition sites, but not in tissues such as liver, choroid plexus, and Langerhans islets, in which TTR is produced. These results suggest that Y78F induced production of an antibody that reacts specifically with deposits and leads to an immune response effective in removing/preventing TTR deposition. Therefore, TTR immunization with selected TTR mutants has potential application in immune therapy for FAP.

<ABSTRACT>
Rad52-dependent homologous recombination (HR) is regulated by the antirecombinase activities of Srs2 and Rqh1/Sgs1 DNA helicases in fission yeast and budding yeast. Functional analysis of Srs2 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe led us to the discovery of Sws1, a novel HR protein with a SWIM-type Zn finger. Inactivation of Sws1 suppresses the genotoxic sensitivity of srs2Delta and rqh1Delta mutants and rescues the inviability of srs2Delta rqh1Delta cells. Sws1 functions at an early step of recombination in a pro-recombinogenic complex with Rlp1 and Rdl1, two RecA-like proteins that are most closely related to the human Rad51 paralogs XRCC2 and RAD51D, respectively. This finding indicates that the XRCC2-RAD51D complex is conserved in lower eukaryotes. A SWS1 homolog exists in human cells. It associates with RAD51D and ablating its expression reduces the number of RAD51 foci. These studies unveil a conserved pathway for the initiation and control of HR in eukaryotic cells.

Mechanism of endophilin N-BAR domain-mediated membrane curvature.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Endophilin-A1 is a BAR domain-containing protein enriched at synapses and is implicated in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. It binds to dynamin and synaptojanin via a C-terminal SH3 domain. We examine the mechanism by which the BAR domain and an N-terminal amphipathic helix, which folds upon membrane binding, work as a functional unit (the N-BAR domain) to promote dimerisation and membrane curvature generation. By electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we show that this amphipathic helix is peripherally bound in the plane of the membrane, with the midpoint of insertion aligned with the phosphate level of headgroups. This places the helix in an optimal position to effect membrane curvature generation. We solved the crystal structure of rat endophilin-A1 BAR domain and examined a distinctive insert protruding from the membrane interaction face. This insert is predicted to form an additional amphipathic helix and is important for curvature generation. Its presence defines an endophilin/nadrin subclass of BAR domains. We propose that N-BAR domains function as low-affinity dimers regulating binding partner recruitment to areas of high membrane curvature.

Modulatory and catalytic modes of ATP binding by the calcium pump.

<ABSTRACT>
We present crystal structures of the calcium-free E2 state of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase, stabilized by the inhibitor thapsigargin and the ATP analog AMPPCP. The structures allow us to describe the ATP binding site in a modulatory mode uncoupled from the Asp351 phosphorylation site. The Glu439 side chain interacts with AMPPCP via an Mg2+ ion in accordance with previous Fe2+ -cleavage studies implicating this residue in the ATPase cycle and in magnesium binding. Functional data on Ca2+ mediated activation indicate that the crystallized state represents an initial stage of ATP modulated deprotonation of E2, preceding the binding of Ca2+ ions in the membrane from the cytoplasmic side. We propose a mechanism of Ca2+ activation of phosphorylation leading directly from the compact E2-ATP form to the Ca2E1-ATP state. In addition, a role of Glu439 in ATP modulation of other steps of the functional cycle is suggested.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Among other functions, lectins play an important role in the innate immune response of vertebrates and invertebrates by recognizing exposed glycans on the surface of potential pathogens. Despite the typically weak interaction of lectin domains with their carbohydrate ligands, they usually achieve high avidity through oligomeric structures or by the presence of tandem carbohydrate-binding domains along the polypeptide. The recently described structure of the fucose-binding European eel agglutinin revealed a novel lectin fold (the "F-type" fold), which is shared with other carbohydrate-binding proteins and apparently unrelated proteins from prokaryotes to vertebrates, and a unique fucose-binding sequence motif. Here we described the biochemical and molecular characterization of a unique fucose-binding lectin (MsaFBP32) isolated from serum of the striped bass (Morone saxatilis), composed of two tandem domains that exhibit the eel carbohydrate recognition sequence motif, which we designate F-type. We also described a novel lectin family ("F-type") constituted by a large number of proteins exhibiting greater multiples of the F-type motif, either tandemly arrayed or in mosaic combinations with other domains, including a putative transmembrane receptor, that suggests an extensive functional diversification of this lectin family. Among the tandem lectins, MsaFBP32 and other tandem binary homologues appear unique in that although their N-terminal domain shows close similarity to the fucose recognition domain of the eel agglutinin, their C-terminal domain exhibits changes that potentially could confer a distinct specificity for fucosylated ligands. In contrast with the amniotes, in which the F-type lectins appear conspicuously absent, the widespread gene duplication in the teleost fish suggests these F-type lectins acquired increasing evolutionary value within this taxon.

Effects of MdmX on Mdm2-mediated downregulation of pRB.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Mdm2, a RING-finger type ubiquitin ligase, is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers. It promotes ubiquitination of the tumor suppressor p53 and can function as an oncogene by largely downregulating p53. Recently, we reported that Mdm2 degrades retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In the present study, we assessed the effects of MdmX, a structural homolog of Mdm2, on the Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of pRB. MdmX is known to negatively regulate p53 function by enhancing the Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Interestingly, MdmX inhibited the Mdm2-mediated pRB ubiquitination. Furthermore, an MdmX siRNA decreased the endogenous pRB level, while MdmX overexpression stimulated pRB functions in cultured cells. Therefore, MdmX may have different roles in the regulation of Mdm2 activity for ubiquitination of pRB and p53.

Structural and functional analysis of the putative pH sensor in the Kir1.1
(ROMK) potassium channel.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The pH-sensitive renal potassium channel Kir1.1 is important for K+ homeostasis. Disruption of the pH-sensing mechanism causes type II Bartter syndrome. The pH sensor is thought to be an anomalously titrated lysine residue (K80) that interacts with two arginine residues as part of an 'RKR triad'. We show that a Kir1.1 orthologue from Fugu rubripes lacks this lysine and yet is still highly pH sensitive, indicating that K80 is not the H+ sensor. Instead, K80 functionally interacts with A177 on transmembrane domain 2 at the 'helix-bundle crossing' and controls the ability of pH-dependent conformational changes to induce pore closure. Although not required for pH inhibition, K80 is indispensable for the coupling of pH gating to the extracellular K+ concentration, explaining its conservation in most Kir1.1 orthologues. Furthermore, we demonstrate that instead of interacting with K80, the RKR arginine residues form highly conserved inter- and intra-subunit interactions that are important for Kir channel gating and influence pH sensitivity indirectly.

<ABSTRACT>
Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an essential enzyme that provides the cell with a balanced supply of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates for DNA replication and repair. Mutations that affect the regulation of RNR in yeast and mammalian cells can lead to genetic abnormalities and cell death. We have expressed and purified the components of the RNR system in fission yeast, the large subunit Cdc22p, the small subunit Suc22p, and the replication inhibitor Spd1p. It was proposed (Liu, C., Powell, K. A., Mundt, K., Wu, L., Carr, A. M., and Caspari, T. (2003) Genes Dev. 17, 1130-1140) that Spd1 is an RNR inhibitor, acting by anchoring the Suc22p inside the nucleus during G1 phase. Using in vitro assays with highly purified proteins we have demonstrated that Spd1 indeed is a very efficient inhibitor of fission yeast RNR, but acting on Cdc22p. Furthermore, biosensor technique showed that Spd1p binds to the Cdc22p with a KD of 2.4 microM, whereas the affinity to Suc22p is negligible. Therefore, Spd1p inhibits fission yeast RNR activity by interacting with the Cdc22p. Similar to the situation in budding yeast, logarithmically growing fission yeast increases the dNTP pools 2-fold after 3 h of incubation in the UV mimetic 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide. This increase is smaller than the increase observed in budding yeast but of the same order as the dNTP pool increase when synchronous Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc10 cells are going from G1 to S-phase.

Novel roles of Akt and mTOR in suppressing TGF-beta/ALK5-mediated Smad3
activation.

<ABSTRACT>
Insulin-like growth factor-I inhibits transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling by blocking activation of Smad3 (S3), via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt-dependent pathway. Here we provide the first report that the kinase activity of Akt is necessary for its ability to suppress many TGF-beta responses, including S3 activation and induction of apoptosis. Wild-type and myristoylated Akts (Akt(WT) and Akt(Myr)) suppress TGF-beta-induced phospho-activation of S3 but not Smad2 (S2), whereas kinase-dead Akt1 (Akt1K179M) or dominant-negative PI3K enhances TGF-beta-induced phospho-activation of both S2 and S3. Using siRNA, rapamycin (Rap), and adenoviral expression for FKBP12-resistant and constitutively active TGF-beta type I receptor (ALK5), we demonstrate that mammalian target of Rap (mTOR) mediates Akt1 suppression of phospho-activation of S3. These and further data on Akt1-S3 binding do not support a recently proposed model that Akt blocks S3 activation through physical interaction and sequestration of S3 from TGF-beta receptors. We propose a novel model whereby Akt suppresses activation of S3 in an Akt kinase-dependent manner through mTOR, a likely route for loss of tumor suppression by TGF-beta in cancers.

Cdk1 regulates centrosome separation by restraining proteolysis of
microtubule-associated proteins.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In yeast, separation of duplicated spindle pole bodies (SPBs) (centrosomes in higher eukaryotes) is an indispensable step in the assembly of mitotic spindle and is triggered by severing of the bridge that connects the sister SPBs. This process requires Cdk1 (Cdc28) activation by Tyrosine 19 dephosphorylation. We show that cells that fail to activate Cdk1 are devoid of spindles due to persistently active APCCdh1, which targets microtubule-associated proteins Cin8, Kip1 and Ase1 for degradation. Tyrosine 19 dephosphorylation of Cdk1 is necessary to specifically prevent proteolysis of these proteins. Interestingly, SPB separation is dependent on the microtubule-bundling activity of Cin8 but not on its motor function. Since ectopic expression of proteolysis-resistant Cin8, Kip1 or Ase1 is sufficient for SPB separation even in the absence of Cdc28-Clb activity, we suggest that stabilization of these mechanical force-generating proteins is the predominant role of Cdc28-Clb in centrosome separation.

<ABSTRACT>
Reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl or superoxide radicals, can be generated by exogenous agents as well as from normal cellular metabolism. Those radicals are known to induce various lesions in DNA, including strand breaks and base modifications. These lesions have been implicated in a variety of diseases such as cancer, arteriosclerosis, arthritis, neurodegenerative disorders and others. To assess these oxidative DNA damages and to evaluate the effects of the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to image DNA molecules exposed to hydroxyl radicals generated via Fenton chemistry. AFM images showed that the circular DNA molecules became linear after incubation with hydroxyl radicals, indicating the development of double-strand breaks. The occurrence of the double-strand breaks was found to depend on the concentration of the hydroxyl radicals and the duration of the reaction. Under the conditions of the experiments, NAC was found to exacerbate the free radical-induced DNA damage.

proteins in establishing spindle bipolarity.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
BACKGROUND: In eukaryotes, assembly of the mitotic spindle requires the interaction of chromosomes with microtubules. During this process, several motor proteins that move along microtubules promote formation of a bipolar microtubule array, but the precise mechanism is unclear. In order to examine the roles of different motor proteins in building a bipolar spindle, we have used a simplified system in which spindles assemble around beads coated with plasmid DNA and incubated in extracts from Xenopus eggs. Using this system, we can study spindle assembly in the absence of paired cues, such as centrosomes and kinetochores, whose microtubule-organizing properties might mask the action of motor proteins. RESULTS: We blocked the function of individual motor proteins in the Xenopus extracts using specific antibodies. Inhibition of Xenopus kinesin-like protein 1 (Xklp1) led either to the dissociation of chromatin beads from microtubule arrays, or to collapsed microtubule bundles on beads. Inhibition of Eg5 resulted in monopolar microtubule arrays emanating from chromatin beads. Addition of antibodies against dynein inhibited the focusing of microtubule ends into spindle poles in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of Xenopus carboxy-terminal kinesin 2 (XCTK2) affected both pole formation and spindle stability. Co-inhibition of XCTK2 and dynein dramatically increased the severity of spindle pole defects. Inhibition of Xklp2 caused only minor spindle pole defects. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple microtubule-based motor activities are required for the bipolar organization of microtubules around chromatin beads, and we propose a model for the roles of the individual motor proteins in this process.

<ABSTRACT>
It has been shown that MDMX inhibits the activity of the tumor suppressor p53 by primarily cooperating with the p53 feedback regulator MDM2. Here, our study shows that this inhibition can be overcome by 14-3-3gamma and Chk1. 14-3-3gamma was identified as an MDMX-associated protein via an immuno-affinity purification-coupled mass spectrometry. Consistently, 14-3-3gamma directly interacted with MDMX in vitro, and this interaction was stimulated by MDMX phosphorylation in vitro and in cells. Interestingly, in response to UV irradiation, the wild-type, but not the kinase-dead mutant, Chk1 phosphorylated MDMX at serine 367, enhanced the 14-3-3gamma-MDMX binding and the cytoplasmic retaining of MDMX. The Chk1 specific inhibitor UCN-01 repressed all of these effects. Moreover, overexpression of 14-3-3gamma, but not its mutant K50E, which did not bind to MDMX, suppressed MDMX-enhanced p53 ubiquitination, leading to p53 stabilization and activation. Finally, ablation of 14-3-3gamma by siRNA reduced UV-induced p53 level and G1 arrest. Thus, these results demonstrate 14-3-3gamma and Chk1 as two novel regulators of MDMX in response to UV irradiation.

<ABSTRACT>
The prohormone convertases play important roles in the maturation of neuropeptides and peptide hormone precursors. Prohormone convertase-2 (PC2) is the only convertase that requires the expression of another neuroendocrine protein, 7B2, for expression of enzyme activity. In this study, we determined that 7B2 can be phosphorylated in Rin cells (a rat insulinoma cell line) and cultured chromaffin cells, but not in AtT-20 cells (derived from mouse anterior pituitary). Phosphoamino acid analysis of Rin cell 7B2 indicated the presence of phosphorylated serine and threonine. Phosphorylation of Ser115 (located within the minimally active 36-residue peptide) was confirmed by mutagenesis, although Ser115 did not represent the sole residue phosphorylated. Two independent assays were used to investigate the effect of phosphorylated 7B2 on PC2 activation: the ability of 7B2 to bind to pro-PC2 was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation, and activation of pro-PC2 was assessed in a cell-free assay. Phosphorylated 7B2 was unable to bind pro-PC2, and the phosphorylated 7B2 peptide (residues 86-121, known to be the minimally active peptide for pro-PC2 activation) was impaired in its ability to facilitate the generation of PC2 activity in membrane fractions containing pro-PC2. In vitro phosphorylation experiments using Golgi membrane fractions showed that 7B2 could be phosphorylated by endogenous Golgi kinases. Golgi kinase activity was strongly inhibited by the broad-range kinase inhibitor staurosporine and partially inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I, but not by the other protein kinase A, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, myosin light chain kinase, and protein kinase G inhibitors tested. We conclude that phosphorylation of 7B2 functionally inactivates this protein and suggest that this may be analogous to the phosphorylating inactivation of BiP, which impairs its ability to bind substrate.

<ABSTRACT>
Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, which involves the deterioration of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. The etiology of PD is still unknown, but recent identification of mutations in familial cases of PD has advanced the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of this neurological disease. Mutations in the parkin gene, which encodes for ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), have been implicated in autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism, an early onset and common familial form of PD. Here we reported that Parkin selectively binds to RanBP2, which is localized in the cytoplasmic filament of the nuclear pore complex and belongs to the small ubiquitin-related modifier E3 ligase family. We also demonstrated that RanBP2 becomes a target for Parkin E3 ubiquitin-ligase and is processed via Parkin-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, Parkin controls the intracellular levels of sumoylated HDAC4, as a result of the ubiquitination and degradation of RanBP2. Our findings suggested that the intracellular levels of RanBP2 and its functional activity may be modulated by Parkin-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal pathways.

<ABSTRACT>
The appropriate regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for cell movement, changes in cell shape, and formation of membrane protrusions like lamellipodia and filopodia. Moreover, several regulatory proteins affecting actin dynamics have been identified in the motile regions of cells. Here, we provide evidence for the involvement of SPIN90 in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and actin comet tail formation. SPIN90 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in COS-7 cells, but exposing the cells to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) caused a redistribution of SPIN90 to the cell cortex and the formation of lamellipodia (or membrane ruffles), both of which were dramatically inhibited in SPIN90-knockdown cells. In addition, the binding of the C terminus of SPIN90 with both the Arp2/3 complex (actin-related proteins Arp 2 and Arp 3) and G-actin activates the former, leading to actin polymerization in vitro. And when coexpressed with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5 kinase, SPIN90 was observed within actin comet tails. Taken these findings suggest that SPIN90 participates in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and in actin-based cell motility.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors repress the transactivation potential of
hypoxia-inducible factors independently of direct acetylation of
HIF-alpha.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are heterodimeric transcription factors regulating the oxygen supply, glucose metabolism, and angiogenesis. HIF function requires the recruitment of p300/CREB-binding protein, two coactivators with histone acetyltransferase activity, by the C-terminal transactivation domain of HIF-alpha (HIF-alphaCAD). Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAIs) induce differentiation or apoptosis and repress tumor growth and angiogenesis, hence being explored intensively as anti-cancer agents. Using combined pharmacological, biochemical, and genetic approaches, here we show that HDAIs repress the transactivation potential of HIF-alphaCAD. This repression is independent of the function of tumor suppressors von Hippel-Lindau or p53 or the degradation of HIF-alpha. We also demonstrate the sufficiency of low concentrations of HDAIs in repression of HIF target genes in tumor cells. We further show that HDAIs induce hyperacetylation of p300 and repress the HIF-1alpha.p300 complex in vivo. In vitro acetylation analysis reveals that the p300CH1 region, but not HIF-alphaCAD, is susceptible to acetylation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that a deacetylase activity is indispensable for the transactivation potential of HIF-alphaCAD and support a model that acetylation regulates HIF function by targeting HIF-alpha.p300 complex, not by direct acetylating HIF-alpha. The demonstration that HDAIs repress both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha transactivation potential independently of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor and p53 function indicates that HDAIs may have biological effects in a broad range of tissues in addition to tumors.

Reduced meiotic crossovers and delayed prophase I progression in
AtMLH3-deficient Arabidopsis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

<ABSTRACT>
Characterization of AtMLH3, the Arabidopsis homologue of the prokaryotic MutL mismatch repair gene, reveals that it is expressed in reproductive tissue where it is required for normal levels of meiotic crossovers (COs). Immunocytological studies in an Atmlh3 mutant indicate that chromosome pairing and synapsis proceed with normal distribution of the early recombination pathway proteins. Localization of the MutS homologue AtMSH4 occurs, suggesting that double Holliday junctions (dHjs) are formed, but the MutL homologue AtMLH1, which forms a heterocomplex with AtMLH3, fails to localize normally. Loss of AtMLH3 results in an approximately 60% reduction in COs and is accompanied by a substantial delay of approximately 25 h in prophase I progression. Analysis of the chiasma distribution in Atmlh3 suggests that dHj resolution can occur, but in contrast to wild type where most or all dHjs are directed to form COs the outcome is biased in favour of a non-CO outcome by a ratio of around 2 to 1. The data are compatible with a model whereby the MutL complex imposes a dHj conformation that ensures CO formation.

Evidence that low doses of Taxol enhance the functional transactivatory

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In the present study, we evidence how in breast cancer cells low doses of Taxol for 18 h determined the upregulation of p53 and p21 waf expression concomitantly with a decrease of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. P53 and its gene product, the mdm2 protein, in treated cells exhibits a prevalent nuclear compartmentalization, thus potentiating p53 transactivatory properties. Indeed, the most important finding of this study consists with the evidence that Taxol at lower concentrations is able to produce the activation of p21 promoter via p53. Prolonged exposure of MCF-7 cells to Taxol (48 h) resulted in an increased co-association between p21 and PCNA compared to control and this well fits with the simultaneous block of cell cycle into the G2/M phase.

N-myristoyltransferase 2 expression in human colon cancer: cross-talk

<ABSTRACT>
A number of viral and eukaryotic proteins which undergo a lipophilic modification by the enzyme N-myristoyltransferase (NMT: NMT1 and NMT2) are required for signal transduction and regulatory functions. To investigate whether NMT2 contributes to the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma, we observed a higher expression of NMT2 in most of the cases of cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues (84.6% of cases; P < 0.05) by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction of NMTs revealed that m-calpain interacts with NMT1 while caspase-3 interacts with NMT2. Our findings provide the first evidence of higher expression of NMT2 in human colorectal adenocarcinomas and the interaction of both forms of NMT with various signaling molecules.

Identification of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-interacting domain in
a secreted FGF-binding protein by phage display.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Fibroblast growth factor-binding proteins (FGF-BP) are secreted carrier proteins that release fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) from the extracellular matrix storage and thus enhance FGF activity. Here we have mapped the interaction domain between human FGF-BP1 and FGF-2. For this, we generated T7 phage display libraries of N-terminally and C-terminally truncated FGF-BP1 fragments that were then panned against immobilized FGF-2. From this panning, a C-terminal fragment of FGF-BP1 (amino acids 193-234) was identified as the minimum binding domain for FGF. As a recombinant protein, this C-terminal fragment binds to FGF-2 and enhances FGF-2-induced signaling in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and GM7373 endothelial cells, as well as mitogenesis and chemotaxis of NIH-3T3 cells. The FGF interaction domain in FGF-BP1 is distinct from the heparin-binding domain (amino acids 110-143), and homology modeling supports the notion of a distinct domain in the C terminus that is conserved across different species. This domain also contains conserved positioning of cysteine residues with the Cys-214/Cys-222 positions in the human protein predicted to participate in disulfide bridge formation. Phage display of a C214A mutation of FGF-BP1 reduced binding to FGF-2, indicating the functional significance of this disulfide bond. We concluded that the FGF interaction domain is contained in the C terminus of FGF-BP1.

Human mitochondrial TyrRS disobeys the tyrosine identity rules.

<ABSTRACT>
Human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from mitochondria (mt-TyrRS) presents dual sequence features characteristic of eubacterial and archaeal TyrRSs, especially in the region containing amino acids recognizing the N1-N72 tyrosine identity pair. This would imply that human mt-TyrRS has lost the capacity to discriminate between the G1-C72 pair typical of eubacterial and mitochondrial tRNATyr and the reverse pair C1-G72 present in archaeal and eukaryal tRNATyr. This expectation was verified by a functional analysis of wild-type or mutated tRNATyr molecules, showing that mt-TyrRS aminoacylates with similar catalytic efficiency its cognate tRNATyr with G1-C72 and its mutated version with C1-G72. This provides the first example of a TyrRS lacking specificity toward N1-N72 and thus of a TyrRS disobeying the identity rules. Sequence comparisons of mt-TyrRSs across phylogeny suggest that the functional behavior of the human mt-TyrRS is conserved among all vertebrate mt-TyrRSs.

<ABSTRACT>
Erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF/KLF1) is an erythroid specific, C(2)H(2) zinc finger transcription factor that is essential for the proper chromatin structure and expression of the adult beta-globin gene. Herein, we determine that 26S proteasome inhibitors lead to an accumulation of EKLF protein in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. In addition, EKLF half-life in both MEL cells (<3h) and fetal liver cells (between 6 and 9h) is stabilized in the presence of these inhibitors. EKLF is ubiquitinated in vivo, however its modification does not rely on a particular internal lysine. Finally, EKLF contains two PEST sequences within its N-terminus that have no effect on the ability of EKLF to be ubiquitinated but contribute to its destabilization.

Crystal structure of a viral FLIP: insights into FLIP-mediated inhibition
of death receptor signaling.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Death receptor signaling is initiated by the assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex, which culminates in the activation of the initiator caspase, either caspase-8 or caspase-10. A family of viral and cellular proteins, known as FLIP, plays an essential role in the regulation of death receptor signaling. Viral FLIP (v-FLIP) and short cellular FLIP (c-FLIPS) inhibit apoptosis by interfering with death receptor signaling. The structure and mechanisms of v-FLIP and c-FLIPS remain largely unknown. Here we report a high resolution crystal structure of MC159, a v-FLIP derived from the molluscum contagiosum virus, which is a member of the human poxvirus family. Unexpectedly, the two tandem death effector domains (DEDs) of MC159 rigidly associate with each other through a hydrophobic interface. Structure-based sequence analysis suggests that this interface is conserved in the tandem DEDs from other v-FLIP, c-FLIPS, and caspase-8 and -10. Strikingly, the overall packing arrangement between the two DEDs of MC159 resembles that between the caspase recruitment domains of Apaf-1 and caspase-9. In addition, each DED of MC159 contains a highly conserved binding motif on the surface, to which loss-of-function mutations in MC159 map. These observations, in conjunction with published evidence, reveal significant insights into the function of v-FLIP and suggest a mechanism by which v-FLIP and c-FLIPS inhibit death receptor signaling.

Regulation of RNA polymerase III transcription during hypertrophic growth.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The cell division-independent growth of terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes is commonly associated with cardiovascular disease. We demonstrate that it is accompanied by a substantial rise in transcription by RNA polymerase (pol) III, which produces essential components of the biosynthetic apparatus, including 5S rRNA and tRNAs. This increase in transcription is achieved by changes in both the activity and level of the essential pol III-specific transcription factor TFIIIB. Erk and c-Myc, which directly activate TFIIIB in proliferating fibroblasts, also induce pol III transcription in growing cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, hypertrophic stimulation increases expression of the essential TFIIIB subunit Brf1, an effect not seen when fibroblasts proliferate. Erk mediates this induction of Brf1 expression and therefore contributes in at least two ways to pol III transcriptional activation during hypertrophy. Increased production of tRNA and 5S rRNA will contribute to the enhanced translational capacity required to sustain hypertrophic growth.

Endocytic receptor LRP together with tPA and PAI-1 coordinates
Mac-1-dependent macrophage migration.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Migration of activated macrophages is essential for resolution of acute inflammation and the initiation of adaptive immunity. Here, we show that efficient macrophage migration in inflammatory environment depends on Mac-1 recognition of a binary complex consisting of fibrin within the provisional matrix and the protease tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator). Subsequent neutralization of tPA by its inhibitor PAI-1 enhances binding of the integrin-protease-inhibitor complex to the endocytic receptor LRP (lipoprotein receptor-related protein), triggering a switch from cell adhesion to cell detachment. Genetic inactivation of Mac-1, tPA, PAI-1 or LRP but not the protease uPA abrogates macrophage migration. The defective macrophage migration in PAI-1-deficient mice can be restored by wild-type but not by a mutant PAI-1 that does not interact with LRP. In vitro analysis shows that tPA promotes Mac-1-mediated adhesion, whereas PAI-1 and LRP facilitate its transition to cell retraction. Our results emphasize the importance of ordered transitions both temporally and spatially between individual steps of cell migration, and support a model where efficient migration of inflammatory macrophages depends on cooperation of three physiologically prominent systems (integrins, coagulation and fibrinolysis, and endocytosis).

Cell-cycle-dependent Xenopus TRF1 recruitment to telomere chromatin
regulated by Polo-like kinase.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Telomeres are regulated by a homeostatic mechanism that includes telomerase and telomeric repeat binding proteins, TRF1 and TRF2. Recently, it has been hypothesized that telomeres assume distinct configurations in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, although direct biochemical evidence is lacking. Here we demonstrated that Xenopus TRF1 (xTRF1) associates with telomere chromatin specifically in mitotic Xenopus egg extracts, and dissociates from it upon mitotic exit. Both the N-terminal TRF-homology (TRFH) domain and the linker region connecting the TRFH domain and the C-terminal Myb domain are required for this cell-cycle-dependent association of xTRF1 with chromatin. In contrast, Xenopus TRF2 (xTRF2) associates with chromatin throughout the cell cycle. We showed that Polo-like kinase (Plx1) phosphorylates xTRF1 in vitro. Moreover, the mitotic xTRF1-chromatin association was significantly impaired when Plx1 was immunodepleted from the extracts. Finally, high telomerase activities were detected in association with replicating interphase chromatin compared with mitotic chromatin. These results indicate that telomere chromatin is actively regulated by cell-cycle-dependent processes, and provide an insight for understanding how telomeres undergo DNA metabolisms during the cell cycle.

</TITLE>

<ABSTRACT>
Mutation of the parkin gene, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, is the major cause of autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (ARJP). Although various substrates for parkin have been identified, the mechanisms that regulate the ubiquitin ligase activity of parkin are poorly understood. Here we report that 14-3-3eta, a chaperone-like protein present abundantly in neurons, could bind to parkin and negatively regulate its ubiquitin ligase activity. Furthermore, 14-3-3eta could bind to the linker region of parkin but not parkin with ARJP-causing R42P, K161N, and T240R mutations. Intriguingly, alpha-synuclein (alpha-SN), another familial Parkinson's disease (PD) gene product, abrogated the 14-3-3eta-induced suppression of parkin activity. alpha-SN could bind tightly to 14-3-3eta and consequently sequester it from the parkin-14-3-3eta complex. PD-causing A30P and A53T mutants of alpha-SN could not bind 14-3-3eta, and failed to activate parkin. Our findings indicate that 14-3-3eta is a regulator that functionally links parkin and alpha-SN. The alpha-SN-positive and 14-3-3eta-negative control of parkin activity sheds new light on the pathophysiological roles of parkin.

Methylation-independent binding to histone H3 and cell cycle-dependent
incorporation of HP1beta into heterochromatin.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have examined HP1beta-chromatin interactions in different molecular contexts in vitro and in vivo. Employing purified components we show that HP1beta exhibits selective, stoichiometric, and salt-resistant binding to recombinant histone H3, associating primarily with the helical "histone fold" domain. Furthermore, using "bulk" nucleosomes released by MNase digestion, S-phase extracts, and fragments of peripheral heterochromatin, we demonstrate that HP1beta associates more tightly with destabilized or disrupted nucleosomes (H3/H4 subcomplexes) than with intact particles. Western blotting and mass spectrometry data indicate that HP1beta-selected H3/H4 particles and subparticles possess a complex pattern of posttranslational modifications but are not particularly enriched in me3K9-H3. Consistent with these results, mapping of HP1beta and me3K9-H3 sites in vivo reveals overlapping, yet spatially distinct patterns, while transient transfection assays with synchronized cells show that stable incorporation of HP1beta-gfp into heterochromatin requires passage through the S-phase. The data amassed challenge the dogma that me3K9H3 is necessary and sufficient for HP1 binding and unveil a new mode of HP1-chromatin interactions.

<ABSTRACT>
Talin mediates integrin signaling by binding to integrin cytoplasmic tails through its FERM domain which consists of F1, F2 and F3 subdomains. TA205, an anti-talin monoclonal antibody, disrupts actin stress fibers and focal adhesion when microinjected into fibroblasts. Here, we showed that TA205 caused an allosteric inhibition of integrin alphaIIb beta3 binding to the talin FERM domain and mapped the TA205 epitope to residues 131-150 in talin F1. Furthermore, binding of a talin rod fragment to talin head was partially inhibited by TA205. These findings suggest that talin F1 may be important in regulation of integrin binding and talin head-rod interaction.

The retinoblastoma family proteins bind to and activate diacylglycerol
kinase zeta.

<ABSTRACT>
The retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is a tumor suppressor and key regulator of the cell cycle. We have previously shown that pRB interacts with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases, lipid kinases that can regulate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels in the nucleus. Here, we investigated pRB binding to another lipid kinase in the phosphoinositide cycle, diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) that phosphorylates the second messenger diacylglycerol to yield phosphatidic acid. We found that DGKzeta, but not DGKalpha or DGK, interacts with pRB in vitro and in vivo. Binding of DGKzeta to pRB is dependent on the phosphorylation status of pRB, since only hypophosphorylated pRB interacts with DGKzeta. DGKzeta also binds to the pRB-related pocket proteins p107 and p130 in vitro and in cells. Although DGKzeta did not affect the ability of pRB to regulate E2F-mediated transcription, we found that pRB, p107, and p130 potently stimulate DGKzeta activity in vitro. Finally, overexpression of DGKzeta in pRB-null fibroblasts reconstitutes a cell cycle arrest induced by gamma-irradiation. These results suggest that DGKzeta may act in vivo as a downstream effector of pRB to regulate nuclear levels of diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid.

Mammalian twinfilin sequesters ADP-G-actin and caps filament barbed ends:
implications in motility.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Twinfilins are conserved actin-binding proteins composed of two actin depolymerizing factor homology (ADF-H) domains. Twinfilins are involved in diverse morphological and motile processes, but their mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Here, we show that mammalian twinfilin both sequesters ADP-G-actin and caps filament barbed ends with preferential affinity for ADP-bound ends. Twinfilin replaces capping protein and promotes motility of N-WASP functionalized beads in a biomimetic motility assay, indicating that the capping activity supports twinfilin's function in motility. Consistently, in vivo twinfilin localizes to actin tails of propelling endosomes. The ADP-actin-sequestering activity cooperates with the filament capping activity of twinfilin to finely regulate motility due to processive filament assembly catalyzed by formin-functionalized beads. The isolated ADF-H domains do not cap barbed ends nor promote motility, but sequester ADP-actin, the C-terminal domain showing the highest affinity. A structural model for binding of twinfilin to barbed ends is proposed based on the similar foldings of twinfilin ADF-H domains and gelsolin segments.

<ABSTRACT>
HGTD-P is a hypoxia-responsive pro-apoptotic protein that transmits hypoxic signals directly to mitochondria. When overexpressed, HGTD-P induces cell death via typical mitochondrial apoptotic cascades. However, much is unknown about post-transcriptional modification and signaling networks of HGTD-P in association with cell death-regulating proteins. We performed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify the molecules involved in HGTD-P-mediated cell death pathways. In this study, we show that heat shock protein 90 physically interacts with HGTD-P and that suppression of Hsp90 activity by low concentrations of geldanamycin reduced HGTD-P-induced mitochondrial catastrophe through inhibition of mitochondrial translocation of HGTD-P.

<ABSTRACT>
Mitochondrial glutathione (mtGSH) depletion increases sensitivity of Bcl-2-overexpressing B16 melanoma (B16M)-F10 cells (high metastatic potential) to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced oxidative stress and death in vitro. In vivo, mtGSH depletion in B16M-F10 cells was achieved by feeding mice (where the B16M-F10 grew as a solid tumor in the footpad) with an L-glutamine (L-Gln)-enriched diet, which promoted in the tumor cells an increase in glutaminase activity, accumulation of cytosolic L-glutamate, and competitive inhibition of GSH transport into mitochondria. L-Gln-adapted B16M-F10 cells, isolated using anti-Met-72 monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry-coupled cell sorting, were injected into the portal vein to produce hepatic metastases. In l-Gln-adapted invasive (iB16M-Gln+) cells, isolated from the liver by the same methodology and treated with TNF-alpha and an antisense Bcl-2 oligodeoxynucleotide, viability decreased to approximately 12%. iB16M-Gln+ cell death associated with increased generation of O2*- and H2O2, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex, and release of proapoptotic molecular signals. Activation of cell death mechanisms was prevented by GSH ester-induced mtGSH replenishment. The oxidative stress-resistant survivors showed an adaptive response that includes overexpression of manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and catalase activities. By treating iB16M-Gln+ cells with a double anti- antisense therapy (Bcl-2 and SOD2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides) and TNF-alpha, metastatic cell survival decreased to approximately 1%. Chemotherapy (taxol plus daunorubicin) easily removed this minimum percentage of survivors. This contribution identifies critical molecules that can be sequentially targeted to facilitate elimination of highly resistant metastatic cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Activation of an over-expressed mutant form of the tumour suppressor protein p53 has been shown to inhibit protein synthesis. To determine whether this effect is due only to high level expression or the mutant nature of the protein, we have used a doxycycline-inducible lung carcinoma cell line capable of expressing wild-type p53. We now show that levels of wild-type p53 similar to those expressed endogenously also inhibit protein synthesis. The mechanism involves dephosphorylation and accumulation of the translational inhibitor 4E-BP1, and increased association of 4E-BP1 with initiation factor eIF4E. The inhibition of translation is not a consequence of p53-mediated apoptosis.

<ABSTRACT>
The E2 proteins of papillomavirus specifically bind to double-stranded DNA containing the consensus sequence ACCG-N4-CGGT, where N is any nucleotide. Here, we show the binding and recognition of dissimilar DNA sequences by an 18 amino-acid peptide (alpha1E2), which corresponds to the DNA-recognition helix, alpha-helix-1. Isothermal DNA binding assays performed with the DNA consensus sequence show saturable curves with alpha1E2 peptide, and the alpha1E2 peptide is converted to an ordered conformation upon complexation. Measurements performed with non-specific DNA sequence fail to saturate, a behavior characteristic of non-specific binding. Binding of the alpha1E2 peptide to these DNA sequences display a different counter-ion dependence, indicating a dissimilar, sequence-dependent mechanism of interaction. Quantitative stoichiometric measurements revealed the specificity in alpha1E2 peptide recognition of the ACCG half-site, demonstrating capacity for discrimination of nucleic acid bases sequences without the need of a whole protein architecture.

<ABSTRACT>
Epigenetic genome modifications are thought to be important for specifying the lineage and developmental stage of cells within a multicellular organism. Here, we show that the epigenetic profile of pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ES) is distinct from that of embryonic carcinoma cells, haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and their differentiated progeny. Silent, lineage-specific genes replicated earlier in pluripotent cells than in tissue-specific stem cells or differentiated cells and had unexpectedly high levels of acetylated H3K9 and methylated H3K4. Unusually, in ES cells these markers of open chromatin were also combined with H3K27 trimethylation at some non-expressed genes. Thus, pluripotency of ES cells is characterized by a specific epigenetic profile where lineage-specific genes may be accessible but, if so, carry repressive H3K27 trimethylation modifications. H3K27 methylation is functionally important for preventing expression of these genes in ES cells as premature expression occurs in embryonic ectoderm development (Eed)-deficient ES cells. Our data suggest that lineage-specific genes are primed for expression in ES cells but are held in check by opposing chromatin modifications.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Activation of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) promoter in infected cells requires the sequential recruitment of several cellular factors to facilitate the formation of a processive elongation complex. The nucleosomal reorganization of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) observed upon Tat stimulation suggests that chromatin-remodeling complexes could play a role during this process. Here, we reported that Tat interacts directly with Brm, a DNA-dependent ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, to activate the HIV-1 LTR. Inhibition of Brm via small interfering RNAs impaired Tat-mediated transactivation of an integrated HIV-1 promoter. Furthermore, Brm is recruited in vivo to the HIV-1 LTR in a Tat-dependent manner. Interestingly, we found that Tat/Brm interaction is regulated by Tat lysine 50 acetylation. These data show the requirement of Tat-mediated recruitment of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex to HIV-1 promoter in the activation of the LTR.

pRb, p107, and p130 are related proteins that play a central role in the regulation of cell cycle progression and terminal differentiation in mammalian cells. Nevertheless, it is still largely unclear how these proteins achieve this regulation in vivo. The intestinal epithelium is an ideal in vivo system in which to study the molecular pathways that regulate proliferation and differentiation because it exists in a constant state of development throughout an animal's lifetime. We studied the phenotypic effects on the intestinal epithelium of mutating Rb and p107 or p130. Although mutating these genes singly had little or no effect, loss of pRb and p107 or p130 together produced chronic hyperplasia and dysplasia of the small intestinal and colonic epithelium. In Rb/p130 double mutants this hyperplasia was associated with defects in terminal differentiation of specific cell types and was dependent on the increased proliferation seen in the epithelium of mutant animals. At the molecular level, dysregulation of the Rb pathway led to an increase in the expression of Math1, Cdx1, Cdx2, transcription factors that regulate proliferation and differentiation in the intestinal epithelium. The absence of Cdx1 function in Rb/p130 double mutant mice partially reverted the histologic phenotype by suppressing ectopic mitosis in the epithelium. These studies implicate the Rb pathway as a regulator of epithelial homeostasis in the intestine.

Arginine/serine-rich protein interaction domain-dependent modulation of a
tau exon 10 splicing enhancer: altered interactions and mechanisms for
functionally antagonistic FTDP-17 mutations Delta280K AND N279K.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Tau exon 10 splicing is altered by autosomal dominant mutations that cause frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism chromosome 17-type and by unknown mechanisms in other related neurodegenerative disorders. Identifying cis- and trans-regulators of tau exon 10 splicing is therefore crucial for understanding disease mechanisms. We previously identified several splicing enhancers and silencers within exon 10 and intron 10. Here, we show that splicing factors SF2/ASF, Tra2beta, and a 50-kDa nuclear protein bind in vitro to the polypurine enhancer at the 5' end of exon 10. Disease splicing mutations N279K and Delta280K disrupt the enhancer and alter associations with these factors. N279K targets robustly bind Tra2beta compared with the normal enhancer, which may explain why N279K enhances exon 10 splicing in vivo. In contrast, factor associations with Delta280K targets are nearly undetectable, explaining why Delta280K almost abolishes exon 10 splicing in vivo. Small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of endogenous SF2/ASF and Tra2beta significantly reduces exon 10 splicing. Exogenous SF2/ASF dramatically enhances normal exon 10 splicing and efficiently rescues the Delta280K splicing defect. Domain deletion analyses show that the C-terminal RS domains of SF2/ASF and Tra2beta are required for normal exon 10 splicing in vivo. In contrast to Tra2beta, the SF2/ASF RS domain remains essential in the presence of a strengthened enhancer or when either weak splice site is strengthened. The data suggest that SF2/ASF has both essential and regulatory roles, whereas Tra2beta has a supporting role in exon 10 splicing.

The role of PACT in the RNA silencing pathway.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Small RNA-mediated gene silencing (RNA silencing) has emerged as a major regulatory pathway in eukaryotes. Identification of the key factors involved in this pathway has been a subject of rigorous investigation in recent years. In humans, small RNAs are generated by Dicer and assembled into the effector complex known as RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) by multiple factors including hAgo2, the mRNA-targeting endonuclease, and TRBP (HIV-1 TAR RNA-binding protein), a dsRNA-binding protein that interacts with both Dicer and hAgo2. Here we describe an additional dsRNA-binding protein known as PACT, which is significant in RNA silencing. PACT is associated with an approximately 500 kDa complex that contains Dicer, hAgo2, and TRBP. The interaction with Dicer involves the third dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) of PACT and the N-terminal region of Dicer containing the helicase motif. Like TRBP, PACT is not required for the pre-microRNA (miRNA) cleavage reaction step. However, the depletion of PACT strongly affects the accumulation of mature miRNA in vivo and moderately reduces the efficiency of small interfering RNA-induced RNA interference. Our study indicates that, unlike other RNase III type proteins, human Dicer may employ two different dsRBD-containing proteins that facilitate RISC assembly.

Dimerisation-dependent GTPase reaction of MnmE: how potassium acts as

<ABSTRACT>
MnmE, a Guanine nucleotide-binding protein conserved between bacteria and man, is involved in the modification of tRNAs. Here we provide biochemical and X-ray structural evidence for a new GTP-hydrolysis mechanism, where the G-domains of MnmE dimerise in a potassium-dependent manner and induce GTP hydrolysis. The structure in the presence of GDP-AlFx and potassium shows how juxtaposition of the subunits induces a conformational change around the nucleotide which reorients the catalytic machinery. A critical glutamate is positioned such as to stabilise or activate the attacking water. Potassium provides a positive charge into the catalytic site in a position analogous to the arginine finger in the Ras-RasGAP system. Mutational studies show that potassium-dependent dimerisation and GTP hydrolysis can be uncoupled and that interaction between the G-domains is a prerequisite for subsequent phosphoryl transfer. We propose a model for the juxtaposition of G-domains in the full-length protein and how it induces conformational changes in the putative tRNA-modification centre.

Mechanism of Mos1 transposition: insights from structural analysis.

<ABSTRACT>
We present the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of Mos1 transposase, a member of the Tc1/mariner family of transposases. The structure comprises an RNase H-like core, bringing together an aspartic acid triad to form the active site, capped by N- and C-terminal alpha-helices. We have solved structures with either one Mg2+ or two Mn2+ ions in the active site, consistent with a two-metal mechanism for catalysis. The lack of hairpin-stabilizing structural motifs is consistent with the absence of a hairpin intermediate in Mos1 excision. We have built a model for the DNA-binding domain of Mos1 transposase, based on the structure of the bipartite DNA-binding domain of Tc3 transposase. Combining this with the crystal structure of the catalytic domain provides a model for the paired-end complex formed between a dimer of Mos1 transposase and inverted repeat DNA. The implications for the mechanisms of first and second strand cleavage are discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
Mitochondria are indispensable for cell viability; however, major mitochondrial functions including citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation are dispensable. Most known essential mitochondrial proteins are involved in preprotein import and assembly, while the only known essential biosynthetic process performed by mitochondria is the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters (ISC). The components of the mitochondrial ISC-assembly machinery are derived from the prokaryotic ISC-assembly machinery. We have identified an essential mitochondrial matrix protein, Isd11 (YER048w-a), that is found in eukaryotes only. Isd11 is required for biogenesis of cellular Fe/S proteins and thus is a novel subunit of the mitochondrial ISC-assembly machinery. It forms a complex with the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1 and is required for formation of an Fe/S cluster on the Isu scaffold proteins. We conclude that Isd11 is an indispensable eukaryotic component of the mitochondrial machinery for biogenesis of Fe/S proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK) is an ubiquitous enzyme with the function of a signal transducer. In Neurospora crassa, an ndk-1(P72H) mutant carrying the point mutation Pro72His was isolated. We found that ndk-1(P72H) showed hypersensitivity to oxidative and heat stress and a decrease in the levels of catalase (Cat)-1 and -3 induced by oxidative, heat stress and illumination compared with wild type (Wt). We found, by conducting a yeast two-hybrid assay, that Cat-1 interacted with NDK-1. NDK-1 was suggested to control Cat-1 and Cat-3 at the post-transcriptional level in response to heat, oxidative stress and light.

<ABSTRACT>
Germ line alterations in BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1) are associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 acts as a scaffold protein implicated in multiple cellular functions, such as transcription, DNA repair, and ubiquitination. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for tumorigenesis are not yet fully understood. We have recently demonstrated that BRCA1 interacts in vivo with acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase alpha (ACCA) through its tandem of BRCA1 C terminus (BRCT) domains. To understand the biological function of the BRCA1.ACCA complex, we sought to determine whether BRCA1 is a regulator of lipogenesis through its interaction with ACCA. We showed here that RNA inhibition-mediated down-regulation of BRCA1 expression induced a marked increase in the fatty acid synthesis. We then delineated the biochemical characteristics of the complex and found that BRCA1 interacts solely with the phosphorylated and inactive form of ACCA (P-ACCA). Finally, we demonstrated that BRCA1 affects lipid synthesis by preventing P-ACCA dephosphorylation. These results suggest that BRCA1 affects lipogenesis through binding to P-ACCA, providing a new mechanism by which BRCA1 may exert a tumor suppressor function.

Inhibition of Na,K-ATPase-suppressive activity of translationally
controlled tumor protein by sorting nexin 6.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) has both extra- and intracellular functions. Our group recently reported that TCTP interacts with Na,K-ATPase and suppresses its activity. Our studies led to the identification of sorting nexin 6 (SNX6) which binds with TCTP as a potential negative regulator of TCTP. SNX6 does not interact directly with any cytoplasmic domains of Na,K-ATPase. However, when overexpressed, it restores the Na,K-ATPase activity suppressed by TCTP. This was confirmed by measurements of purified plasma membrane Na,K-ATPase activity after incubation with recombinant TCTP and SNX6. SNX6 alone has no effect on Na,K-ATPase activity, but activates Na,K-ATPase via inhibition of TCTP. Inhibition of endogenous TCTP by the overexpression of SNX6 or knockdown of TCTP expression by siTCTP increased Na,K-ATPase activity above the basal level. The interaction between SNX6 and TCTP thus appears to regulate Na,K-ATPase activity.

<ABSTRACT>
The ubiquitin-specific protease, USP7, has key roles in the p53 pathway whereby it stabilizes both p53 and MDM2. We show that the N-terminal domain of USP7 binds two closely spaced 4-residue sites in both p53 and MDM2, falling between p53 residues 359-367 and MDM2 residues 147-159. Cocrystal structures with USP7 were determined for both p53 peptides and for one MDM2 peptide. These peptides bind the same surface of USP7 as Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1, explaining the competitive nature of the interactions. The structures and mutagenesis data indicate a preference for a P/AXXS motif in peptides that bind USP7. Contacts made by serine are identical and crucial for all peptides, and Trp165 in the peptide-binding pocket of USP7 is also crucial. These results help to elucidate the mechanism of substrate recognition by USP7 and the regulation of the p53 pathway.

NMR solution structure of the tandem Src homology 3 domains of p47phox

<ABSTRACT>
The phagocyte NADPH oxidase plays a crucial role in host defense against microbial infections by generating reactive oxygen species. It is a multisubunit enzyme composed of membrane-bound flavocytochrome b558 as well as cytosolic components, including p47phox, which is essential for assembly of the complex. When phagocytes are activated, the cytosolic components of the NADPH oxidase translocate to flavocytochrome b558 due to binding of the tandem Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of p47phox to a proline-rich region in p22phox, a subunit of flavocytochrome b558. Using NMR titration, we first identified the proline-rich region of p22phox that is essential for binding to the tandem SH3 domains of p47phox. We subsequently determined the solution structure of the p47phox tandem SH3 domains complexed with the proline-rich peptide of p22phox using NMR spectroscopy. In contrast to the intertwined dimer reported for the crystal state, the solution structure is a monomer. The central region of the p22phox peptide forms a polyproline type II helix that is sandwiched by the N- and C-terminal SH3 domains, as was observed in the crystal structure, whereas the C-terminal region of the peptide takes on a short alpha-helical conformation that provides an additional binding site with the N-terminal SH3 domain. Thus, the C-terminal alpha-helical region of the p22phox peptide increases the binding affinity for the tandem SH3 domains of p47phox more than 10-fold.

An antagonistic function for Arabidopsis DCL2 in development and a new
function for DCL4 in generating viral siRNAs.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Plants contain more DICER-LIKE (DCL) enzymes and double-stranded RNA binding (DRB) proteins than other eukaryotes, resulting in increased small RNA network complexities. Analyses of single, double, triple and quadruple dcl mutants exposed DCL1 as a sophisticated enzyme capable of producing both microRNAs (miRNAs) and siRNAs, unlike the three other DCLs, which only produce siRNAs. Depletion of siRNA-specific DCLs results in unbalanced small RNA levels, indicating a redeployment of DCL/DRB complexes. In particular, DCL2 antagonizes the production of miRNAs and siRNAs by DCL1 in certain circumstances and affects development deleteriously in dcl1 dcl4 and dcl1 dcl3 dcl4 mutant plants, whereas dcl1 dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 quadruple mutant plants are viable. We also show that viral siRNAs are produced by DCL4, and that DCL2 can substitute for DCL4 when this latter activity is reduced or inhibited by viruses, pointing to the competitiveness of DCL2. Given the complexity of the small RNA repertoire in plants, the implication of each DCL, in particular DCL2, in the production of small RNAs that have no known function will constitute one of the next challenges.

mTOR-dependent stimulation of the association of eIF4G and eIF3 by

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Insulin stimulates protein synthesis by increasing translation initiation. This response is mediated by mTOR and is believed to result from 4EBP1 phosphorylation, which allows eIF4E to bind eIF4G. Here, we present evidence that mTOR interacts directly with eIF3 and that mTOR controls the association of eIF3 and eIF4G. Activating mTOR signaling with insulin increased by as much as five-fold the amount of eIF4G bound to eIF3. This novel effect was blocked by rapamycin and other inhibitors of mTOR, and it required neither eIF4E binding to eIF4G nor eIF3 binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit. The increase in eIF4G associated with eIF3 occurred rapidly and at physiological concentrations of insulin. Moreover, the magnitude of the response was similar to the increase in eIF4E binding to eIF4G produced by insulin. Thus, increasing eIF4G association with eIF3 represents a potentially important mechanism by which insulin, as well as amino acids and growth factors that activate mTOR, stimulate translation.

<ABSTRACT>
Membrane-bound glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) is a zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate (NAAG) to N-acetyl-L-aspartate and L-glutamate (which is itself a neurotransmitter). Potent and selective GCPII inhibitors have been shown to decrease brain glutamate and provide neuroprotection in preclinical models of stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and neuropathic pain. Here, we report crystal structures of the extracellular part of GCPII in complex with both potent and weak inhibitors and with glutamate, the product of the enzyme's hydrolysis reaction, at 2.0, 2.4, and 2.2 A resolution, respectively. GCPII folds into three domains: protease-like, apical, and C-terminal. All three participate in substrate binding, with two of them directly involved in C-terminal glutamate recognition. One of the carbohydrate moieties of the enzyme is essential for homodimer formation of GCPII. The three-dimensional structures presented here reveal an induced-fit substrate-binding mode of this key enzyme and provide essential information for the design of GCPII inhibitors useful in the treatment of neuronal diseases and prostate cancer.

<ABSTRACT>
In our previous studies we showed that apoE treatment of neurons activated ERK 1/2 signaling, and activation was blocked by treatment with inhibitors of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK 801, and calcium channel blockers. We hypothesized an interaction between the low density lipoprotein receptor family members and the NMDA receptor. In the present study, we confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments an interaction between the apoE receptor, ApoEr2, and NMDAR1 through their extracellular domains. We also found that the PDZ1 domain of PSD95, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein, interacted with the C terminus of ApoEr2 via an alternatively spliced, intracellular exon. This interaction between ApoEr2 and PSD95 in neurons was modulated by NMDA receptor activation and an ApoEr2 ligand. We also found that the PDZ2 domain of PSD95 interacted with the NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors. Full-length PSD95 increased cell surface levels of ApoEr2 and its cleavage, resulting in increases in secreted ApoEr2 and C-terminal fragments of ApoEr2. These studies suggest that ApoEr2 can form a multiprotein complex with NMDA receptor subunits and PSD95.

Huckebein-mediated autoregulation of Glide/Gcm triggers glia
specification.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cell specification in the nervous system requires patterning genes dictating spatio-temporal coordinates as well as fate determinants. In the case of neurons, which are controlled by the family of proneural transcription factors, binding specificity and patterned expression trigger both differentiation and specification. In contrast, a single gene, glide cell deficient/glial cell missing (glide/gcm), is sufficient for all fly lateral glial differentiation. How can different types of cells develop in the presence of a single fate determinant, that is, how do differentiation and specification pathways integrate and produce distinct glial populations is not known. By following an identified lineage, we here show that glia specification is triggered by high glide/gcm expression levels, mediated by cell-specific protein-protein interactions. Huckebein (Hkb), a lineage-specific factor, provides a molecular link between glide/gcm and positional cues. Importantly, Hkb does not activate transcription; rather, it physically interacts with Glide/Gcm thereby triggering its autoregulation. These data emphasize the importance of fate determinant cell-specific quantitative regulation in the establishment of cell diversity.

<ABSTRACT>
Lipopolysaccharides (LPS; endotoxin) activate immunocompetent cells of the host via a transmembrane signaling process. In this study, we investigated the function of the LPS-binding protein (LBP) in this process. The cytoplasmic membrane of the cells was mimicked by lipid liposomes adsorbed on mica, and the lateral organization of LBP in these membranes and its interaction with LPS aggregates were characterized by atomic force microscopy. Using cantilever tips functionalized with anti-LBP antibodies, single LBP molecules were localized in the membrane at low concentrations. At higher concentrations, LBP formed clusters of several molecules and caused cross-linking of lipid bilayers. The addition of LPS to LBP-containing liposomes led to the formation of LPS domains in the membranes, which could be inhibited by anti-LBP antibodies. Thus, LBP mediates the fusion of lipid membranes and LPS aggregates.

<ABSTRACT>
Group A streptococci (GAS) display receptors for the human zymogen plasminogen on the cell surface, one of which is the plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M protein (PAM). Characterization of PAM genes from 12 GAS isolates showed significant variation within the plasminogen-binding repeat motifs (a1/a2) of this protein. To determine the impact of sequence variation on protein function, recombinant proteins representing five naturally occurring variants of PAM, together with a recombinant M1 protein, were expressed and purified. Equilibrium dissociation constants for the interaction of PAM variants with biotinylated Glu-plasminogen ranged from 1.58 to 4.99 nm. Effective concentrations of prototype PAM required for 50% inhibition of plasminogen binding to immobilized PAM variants ranged from 0.68 to 22.06 nm. These results suggest that although variation in the a1/a2 region of the PAM protein does affect the comparative affinity of PAM variants, the functional capacity to bind plasminogen is conserved. Additionally, a potential role for the a1 region of PAM in eliciting a protective immune response was investigated by using a mouse model for GAS infection. The a1 region of PAM was found to protect immunized mice challenged with a PAM-positive GAS strain. These data suggest a link between selective immune pressure against the plasminogen-binding repeats and the functional conservation of the binding domain in PAM variants.

<ABSTRACT>
The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) regulate matrix metalloproteinase activity required for cell migration/invasion associated with cancer progression and angiogenesis. TIMPs also modulate cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo independent of their matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory activity. Here, we show that TIMP-2 mediates G1 growth arrest in human endothelial cells through de novo synthesis of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. TIMP-2-mediated inhibition of Cdk4 and Cdk2 activity is associated with increased binding of p27Kip1 to these complexes in vivo. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors or expression of a dominant negative Shp-1 mutant ablates TIMP-2 induction of p27Kip1. Finally, angiogenic responses to fibroblast growth factor-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor-A in "motheaten viable" Shp-1-deficient mice are resistant to TIMP-2 inhibition, demonstrating that Shp-1 is an important negative regulator of angiogenesis in vivo.

<ABSTRACT>
In higher eukaryotes, the origin recognition complex (ORC) lacks sequence-specific DNA binding, and it remains unclear what other factors specify an origin of DNA replication. The Epstein-Barr virus origin of plasmid replication (OriP) recruits ORC, but the precise mechanism of ORC recruitment and origin activation is not clear. We now show that ORC is recruited selectively to the dyad symmetry (DS) region of OriP as a consequence of direct interactions with telomere repeat factor 2 (TRF2) and ORC1. TRF-binding sites within DS stimulate replication initiation and facilitate ORC recruitment in vitro and in vivo. TRF2, but not TRF1 or hRap1, recruits ORC from nuclear extracts. The amino-terminal domain of TRF2 associated with a specific region of ORC1 and was necessary for stimulation of DNA replication. These results support a model in which TRF2 stimulates OriP replication activity by direct binding with ORC subunits.

<ABSTRACT>
To better understand the critical conversions that RNA polymerase II complexes undergo during promoter escape, we determined in vitro the precise positions of the rate-limiting step and the last step requiring negative superhelicity or TFIIE and TFIIH. We found that both steps occur after synthesis of an 8 nt RNA during the stage encompassing translocation of the polymerase active site to the ninth register. When added to reactions just before this step, TFIIE and TFIIH overcame the requirement for negative superhelicity. The positions at which both steps occur were strictly dependent on RNA length as opposed to the location of the polymerase relative to promoter elements, showing that the transcript itself controls transformations during promoter escape. We propose a model in which completion of promoter escape involves a rate-limiting conversion of early transcribing complexes into elongation complexes. This transformation is triggered by synthesis of an 8 nt RNA, occurs independent of the general transcription factors, and requires under-winding in the DNA template via negative superhelicity or the action of TFIIE and TFIIH.

Pin2/TRF1 negatively regulates telomere length and also plays a critical role in cell cycle checkpoint control. Pin2/TRF1 is down-regulated in many human cancers and may be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, but components of the pathway involved in Pin2/TRF1 turnover have not been elucidated. By using the two-hybrid system, we recently identified Pin2/TRF1-interacting proteins, PinX1-4, and we demonstrated that PinX1 is a conserved telomerase inhibitor and a putative tumor suppressor. Here we report the characterization of PinX3. PinX3 was later found to be identical to Fbx4, a member of the F-box family of proteins, which function as substrate-specific adaptors of Cul1-based ubiquitin ligases. Fbx4 interacts with both Pin2 and TRF1 isoforms and promotes their ubiquitination in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, overexpression of Fbx4 reduces endogenous Pin2/TRF1 protein levels and causes progressive telomere elongation in human cells. In contrast, inhibition of Fbx4 by RNA interference stabilizes Pin2/TRF1 and promotes telomere shortening, thereby impairing cell growth. These results demonstrate that Fbx4 is a central regulator of Pin2/TRF1 protein abundance and that alterations in the stability of Pin2/TRF1 can have a dramatic impact on telomere length. Thus, Fbx4 may play a critical role in telomere maintenance.

Physiological characterization of Haemophilus influenzae Rd deficient in
its glutathione-dependent peroxidase PGdx.

<ABSTRACT>
The chimeric peroxidase PGdx of Haemophilus influenzae Rd belongs to a recently identified family of thiol peroxidases capable of reducing hydrogen peroxide as well as alkylhydroperoxides by means of glutathione redox cycling. In the present study, we constructed a H. influenzae Rd strain, deficient in its PGdx encoding gene (open reading frame HI0572). The mutant was shown by disk inhibition and liquid culture growth assays to exhibit increased susceptibility to organic hydroperoxides. The hampered growth was restored by complementing the interrupted gene on the genome with a replicating plasmid bearing an intact copy of the gene, hereby rejecting the possible influences of polar effects. Elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity, due to the catalase HktE, were measured in the absence of a functional pgdx gene rendering the mutant more resilient against hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, after initiation of the stationary phase, aerobic cultures of the pgdx mutant were practically devoid of living cells, whereas wild-type counterparts retained viability. This observed feature was alleviated by complementation with the functional gene or with the addition of catalase.

Vacuolar sequential exocytosis of large dense-core vesicles in adrenal
medulla.

<ABSTRACT>
Individual exocytic events in intact adrenal medulla were visualized by two-photon extracellular polar-tracer imaging. Exocytosis of chromaffin vesicles often occurred in a sequential manner, involving first vesicles located at the cell periphery and then those present deeper within the cytoplasm. Sequential exocytosis occurred preferentially at regions of the plasma membrane facing the intercellular space. The compound vesicles swelled to more than five times their original volume and formed vacuolar exocytic lumens as a result of expansion of intravesicular gels and their confinement within the lumen by the fusion pore and the narrow intercellular space. Such luminal swelling greatly promoted sequential exocytosis. The SNARE protein SNAP25 rapidly migrated from the plasma membrane to the membrane of fused vesicles. These data indicate that vesicles present deeper within the cytoplasm can be fusion ready like those at the cell periphery, and that swelling of exocytic lumens promotes assembly of the fusion machinery. We suggest the existence of two molecular configurations for fusion-ready states in Ca2+ -dependent exocytosis.

<ABSTRACT>
Chromosome ends in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are positioned in clusters at the nuclear rim. We report that Ctf18, Ctf8, and Dcc1, the subunits of a Replication Factor C (RFC)-like complex, are essential for the perinuclear positioning of telomeres. In both yeast and mammalian cells, peripheral nuclear positioning of chromatin during G1 phase correlates with late DNA replication. We find that the mislocalized telomeres of ctf18 cells still replicate late, showing that late DNA replication does not require peripheral positioning during G1. The Ku and Sir complexes have been shown to act through separate pathways to position telomeres, but in the absence of Ctf18 neither pathway can act fully to maintain telomere position. Surprisingly CTF18 is not required for Ku or Sir4-mediated peripheral tethering of a nontelomeric chromosome locus. Our results suggest that the Ctf18 RFC-like complex modifies telomeric chromatin to make it competent for normal localization to the nuclear periphery.

Inactivation of Dnmt3b in mouse embryonic fibroblasts results in DNA
hypomethylation, chromosomal instability, and spontaneous immortalization.

<ABSTRACT>
DNA hypomethylation is a hallmark of many types of solid tumors. However, it remains elusive how DNA hypomethylation may contribute to tumorigenesis. In this study, we have investigated how targeted disruption of the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b affects the growth of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Our studies led to the following observations. 1) Constitutive or conditional deletion of Dnmt3b, but not Dnmt3a, resulted in partial loss of DNA methylation throughout the genome, suggesting that Dnmt3b, in addition to the major maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1, is required for maintaining DNA methylation in MEF cells. 2) Dnmt3b-deficient MEF cells showed aneuploidy and polyploidy, chromosomal breaks, and fusions. 3) Inactivation of Dnmt3b resulted in either premature senescence or spontaneous immortalization of MEF cells. 4) The G(1) to S-phase checkpoint was intact in primary and spontaneously immortalized Dnmt3b-deficient MEFs because the p53 protein was inducible by DNA damage. Interestingly, protein levels of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21 were increased in immortalized Dnmt3b-deficient MEFs even in the absence of p53 induction. These results suggest that DNA hypomethylation may induce genomic instability, which in turn leads to spontaneous immortalization or premature senescence of Dnmt3b-deficient MEFs via a p53-independent mechanism.

<ABSTRACT>
The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains four members of the FtsH protease family. One of these, FtsH (slr0228), has been implicated recently in the repair of photodamaged photosystem II (PSII) complexes. We have demonstrated here, using a combination of blue native PAGE, radiolabeling, and immunoblotting, that FtsH (slr0228) is required for selective replacement of the D1 reaction center subunit in both wild type PSII complexes and in PSII subcomplexes lacking the PSII chlorophyll a-binding subunit CP43. To test whether FtsH (slr0228) has a more general role in protein quality control in vivo, we have studied the synthesis and degradation of PSII subunits in wild type and in defined insertion and missense mutants incapable of proper assembly of the PSII holoenzyme. We discovered that, when the gene encoding FtsH (slr0228) was disrupted in these strains, the overall level of assembly intermediates and unassembled PSII proteins markedly increased. Pulse-chase experiments showed that this was due to reduced rates of degradation in vivo. Importantly, analysis of epitope-tagged and green fluorescent protein-tagged strains revealed that slr0228 was present in the thylakoid and not the cytoplasmic membrane. Overall, our results show that FtsH (slr0228) plays an important role in controlling the removal of PSII subunits from the thylakoid membrane and is not restricted to selective D1 turnover.

Rabphilin regulates SNARE-dependent re-priming of synaptic vesicles for
fusion.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Synaptic vesicle fusion is catalyzed by assembly of synaptic SNARE complexes, and is regulated by the synaptic vesicle GTP-binding protein Rab3 that binds to RIM and to rabphilin. RIM is a known physiological regulator of fusion, but the role of rabphilin remains obscure. We now show that rabphilin regulates recovery of synaptic vesicles from use-dependent depression, probably by a direct interaction with the SNARE protein SNAP-25. Deletion of rabphilin dramatically accelerates recovery of depressed synaptic responses; this phenotype is rescued by viral expression of wild-type rabphilin, but not of mutant rabphilin lacking the second rabphilin C2 domain that binds to SNAP-25. Moreover, deletion of rabphilin also increases the size of synaptic responses in synapses lacking the vesicular SNARE protein synaptobrevin in which synaptic responses are severely depressed. Our data suggest that binding of rabphilin to SNAP-25 regulates exocytosis of synaptic vesicles after the readily releasable pool has either been physiologically exhausted by use-dependent depression, or has been artificially depleted by deletion of synaptobrevin.

Domain interaction sites of human lens betaB2-crystallin.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
betaB2-crystallin, the major component of beta-crystallin, is a dimer at low concentrations but can form oligomers under physiological conditions. The interaction domains have been speculated to be the beta-sheets, each of which is formed by two or more beta-strands. betaB2-crystallin consists of 16 beta-strands, 8 in the N-terminal domain and 8 in the C-terminal domain. Domain interaction sites may be removed by destroying the beta-strands, which can be done by site-specific mutations, substituting the beta-formers (Val, Phe, Leu) with Glu or Asn, strong beta-breakers. We have cloned the following beta-strand-deleted mutants, I20E, L34E, V54E, V60E, V73E, L97E, I109E, I124E, V144E, V152E, L162E, L165E, and V187E and their corresponding X --> Asn mutants. We also made two mutants, V46E and V129E, that were not on the beta-strand as controls. Disruption of protein-protein interactions was screened by a mammalian two-hybrid system assay. Protein-protein interactions decreased for all beta-strand-deleted mutants except I20E, L34E, and L162E mutants; this effect was not seen in the two mutant controls, V46E and V129E. The sequences around Val-54, Val-60, Val-73, and Leu-97 in the N-terminal region and Ile-109, Ile-124, Val-144, Val-152, Leu-165, and Val-187 in the C-terminal region that formed beta-strands appear to be important in dimerization. Some selected mutant proteins that showed strong (V46E and V129E) and reduced (V60E, V144E, V60N, and V144N) interactions were expressed in bacterial culture and were studied with spectroscopy and chromatography. The V60E and V144E mutants were found to be partially unfolded and incapable of forming a complete dimer.

<ABSTRACT>
Recent studies have shown that phagosome maturation depends on the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, indicating that cytokine modulates phagosome maturation. However, the mechanism of cytokine-mediated modulation of intracellular trafficking remains to be elucidated. Here, we have shown that treatment of macrophages with IL-6 specifically induce the expression of Rab5 through the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, whereas IL-12 exclusively upregulate the expression of Rab7 through the activation of p38 MAPK. We have cloned the 5'-flanking regions of the rab5c or rab7 into the promoterless reporter vector. Our results have shown that cells transfected with rab5c chimera are transactivated by IL-6, and IL-12 specifically transactivates cells containing rab7 chimera. Moreover, our results also show that IL-12 induces lysosomal transport, whereas IL-6 stimulates the fusion between early compartments in macrophages and accordingly modulates Salmonella trafficking and survival in macrophages. This is the first demonstration showing that cytokine differentially regulates endocytic trafficking by controlling the expression of appropriate Rab GTPase, and provides insight into the mechanism of cytokine-mediated regulation of intracellular trafficking.

<ABSTRACT>
A cDNA encoding a C20 Delta8-desaturase was isolated from the free-living soil amoeba, Acanthamoeba castellanii and functionally characterised by heterologous expression. The open reading frame of the A. castellanii C20 Delta8-desaturase showed similarity to other microsomal front-end desaturases, but the N-terminal domain contained a variant form of the conserved heme-binding motif in which H-P-G-G is replaced by H-P-A-G. Co-expression of the A. castellani Delta8-desaturase with the Isochrysis galbana Delta9-elongase in transgenic Arabidopsis plants confirmed the activity observed in yeast and its role in the alternative pathway for C20 polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Acyl-CoA profiles of these transgenic plants revealed an unexpected accumulation of C20 fatty acids in the acyl-CoA pool. This is the first report of an alternative pathway C20 Delta8-desaturase from a non-photosynthetic organism, and also the first report of a front-end desaturase lacking the canonical cytochrome b5 domain.

<ABSTRACT>
The imprint at the mat1 locus of Schizosaccharomyces pombe acts to initiate the replication-coupled recombination event that underlies mating-type switching. However, the nature of the imprint has been an area of dispute. Two alternative models have been proposed: one stated that the imprint is a nick in the DNA, whereas our data suggested that it consists of one or two ribonucleotides incorporated into the otherwise intact DNA duplex. Here, we verify key predictions of the RNA model by characterization of wild-type genomic DNA purified under conditions known to hydrolyse DNA-RNA-DNA hybrid strands. First, we observe one-nucleotide gap at the hydrolysed DNA, as expected from the presence of two ribonucleotides. Second, using a novel assay based on ligation-mediated PCR, a 3'-terminal ribonucleotide is detected at the hydrolysed imprint. Our observations allow the unification of available data sets characterizing the wild-type imprint.

<ABSTRACT>
Adult neural stem cells are rare, and little is known about their unique characteristics, leaving their in vivo identity enigmatic. We show that Lewis X (LeX), a carbohydrate expressed by embryonic pluripotent stem cells, is made by adult mouse subventricular zone (SVZ) stem cells and shed into their environment. Only 4% of acutely isolated SVZ cells are LeX(+); this subpopulation, purified by FACS, contains the SVZ stem cells. Ependymal cells are LeX(-), and purified ependymal cells do not make neurospheres, resolving the controversial claim that these are stem cells. Thus, LeX expression by adult CNS stem cells aids their in vivo identification, allows their enrichment, and raises new questions about the role of this unusual carbohydrate in stem cell biology.

Activation of the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR promoter in the absence

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The protein kinase regulated by RNA (PKR) is interferon (IFN)-inducible and plays important roles in many cellular processes, including virus multiplication, cell growth, and apoptosis. The TATA-less PKR promoter possesses a novel 15-bp DNA element (kinase conserved sequence (KCS)) unique to the human and mouse PKR genes that is conserved in sequence and position. We found that Sp1 and Sp3 of the Sp family of transcription factors bind at the KCS element. Their involvement was analyzed in the activation of basal and IFN-inducible PKR promoter activity. Both the small and large isoforms of Sp3 co-purified with KCS protein binding activity (KBP) by using nuclear extracts from HeLa cells not treated with IFN. Two forms of the KCS-binding protein complex were demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis; one contained Sp1 and the other Sp3. In mouse cells null for all Sp3 isoforms, PKR expression was reduced to approximately 50% that of wild-type cells in the absence of IFN. The IFN-inducible expression of PKR, however, was Sp3-independent but STAT1- and JAK1-dependent. Overexpression of Sp1 in human U cells resulted in increased PKR promoter activity. In Drosophila SL2 cells lacking Sp proteins, both Sp1 and Sp3 large but not small isoforms activated PKR promoter expression, with the Sp1-mediated activation dominant. Mutational analysis of the PKR promoter region indicated a cooperative interaction between two different Sp sites, one of which is within the KCS element. These results establish that, in the absence of IFN treatment, activation of PKR basal expression is mediated by Sp1 and Sp3 proteins in a cooperative manner.

Release of free F2-isoprostanes from esterified phospholipids is catalyzed
by intracellular and plasma platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolases.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
F2-isoprostanes are produced in vivo by nonenzymatic peroxidation of arachidonic acid esterified in phospholipids. Increased urinary and plasma F2-isoprostane levels are associated with a number of human diseases. These metabolites are regarded as excellent markers of oxidant stress in vivo. Isoprostanes are initially generated in situ, i.e. when the arachidonate precursor is esterified in phospholipids, and they are subsequently released in free form. Although the mechanism(s) responsible for the release of free isoprostanes after in situ generation in membrane phospholipids is, for the most part, unknown, this process is likely mediated by phospholipase A2 activity(ies). Here we reported that human plasma contains an enzymatic activity that catalyzes this reaction. The activity associates with high density and low density lipoprotein and comigrates with platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase on KBr density gradients. Plasma samples from subjects deficient in PAF acetylhydrolase do not release F2-isoprostanes from esterified precursors. The intracellular PAF acetylhydrolase II, which shares homology to the plasma enzyme, also catalyzes this reaction. We found that both the intracellular and plasma PAF acetylhydrolases have high affinity for esterified F2-isoprostanes. However, the rate of esterified F2-isoprostane hydrolysis is much slower compared with the rate of hydrolysis of other substrates utilized by these enzymes. Studies using PAF acetylhydrolase transgenic mice indicated that these animals have a higher capacity to release F2-isoprostanes compared with nontransgenic littermates. Our results suggested that PAF acetylhydrolases play key roles in the hydrolysis of F2-isoprostanes esterified on phospholipids in vivo.

The yeast Arr4p ATPase binds the chloride transporter Gef1p when copper is

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cellular ion homeostasis involves communication between the cytosol and the luminal compartment of organelles. This is particularly critical for metal ions because of their toxic potential. We have identified the yeast homologue of the prokaryotic ArsA protein, the homodimeric ATPase Arr4p, as a protein that binds to the yeast intracellular CLC chloride-transport protein, Gef1p. We show that binding of Arr4p to the C terminus of Gef1p requires the presence of yeast cytosol and is sensitive to a highly specific copper chelator in vitro and in vivo. Copper alone can substitute for cytosol to support the interaction of Arr4p with the C terminus of Gef1p. The migration behavior of Arr4p in nonreducing gel electrophoresis correlates with cellular copper deficiency, repletion, or stress. Our homology model of Arr4p shows that the antimony (arsenic) metal binding site of ArsA is not conserved in Arr4p. The model suggests that a pair of cysteines, Cys285 and Cys288, is located in the interface of the Arr4p dimer. These residues are required for Arr4p homodimerization and for binding to the C terminus of Gef1p. Whereas both proteins are required for normal growth under iron-limiting conditions, they play opposite roles when copper and heat stress are combined in an alkaline environment. Under these conditions, deltagef1 cells grow much better than wild type yeast, whereas deltaarr4 cells are unable to grow. Comparison of the deltaarr4 with the deltaarr4deltagef1 strain suggests that Arr4p antagonizes the function of Gef1p.

The AAA+ATPase p97/VCP, helped by adaptor proteins, exerts its essential role in cellular events such as endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation or the reassembly of Golgi, ER and the nuclear envelope after mitosis. Here, we report the three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy structures at approximately 20 Angstroms resolution in two nucleotide states of the endogenous hexameric p97 in complex with a recombinant p47 trimer, one of the major p97 adaptor proteins involved in membrane fusion. Depending on the nucleotide state, we observe the p47 trimer to be in two distinct arrangements on top of the p97 hexamer. By combining the EM data with NMR and other biophysical measurements, we propose a model of ATP-dependent p97(N) domain motions that lead to a rearrangement of p47 domains, which could result in the disassembly of target protein complexes.

<ABSTRACT>
The ClC channels are members of a large protein family of chloride (Cl-) channels and secondary active Cl- transporters. Despite their diverse functions, the transmembrane architecture within the family is conserved. Here we present a crystallographic study on the ion-binding properties of the ClC selectivity filter in the close homolog from Escherichia coli (EcClC). The ClC selectivity filter contains three ion-binding sites that bridge the extra- and intracellular solutions. The sites bind Cl- ions with mM affinity. Despite their close proximity within the filter, the three sites can be occupied simultaneously. The ion-binding properties are found conserved from the bacterial transporter EcClC to the human Cl- channel ClC-1, suggesting a close functional link between ion permeation in the channels and active transport in the transporters. In resemblance to K+ channels, ions permeate the ClC channel in a single file, with mutual repulsion between the ions fostering rapid conduction.

<ABSTRACT>
Premature polymerization of flagellin (FliC), the main component of flagellar filaments, is prevented by the FliS chaperone in the cytosol. Interaction of FliS with flagellin was characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry producing an association constant of 1.9x10(7) M-1 and a binding stoichiometry of 1:1. Experiments with truncated FliC fragments demonstrated that the C-terminal disordered region of flagellin is essential for FliS binding. As revealed by thermal unfolding experiments, FliS does not function as an antifolding factor keeping flagellin in a secretion-competent conformation. Instead, FliS binding facilitates the formation of alpha-helical secondary structure in the chaperone binding region of flagellin.

<ABSTRACT>
We studied the structural dynamics of chicken myosin V by combining the localization power of fluorescent imaging with one nanometer accuracy (FIONA) with the ability to detect angular changes of a fluorescent probe. The myosin V was labeled with bifunctional rhodamine on one of its calmodulin light chains. For every 74 nm translocation, the probe exhibited two reorientational motions, associated with alternating smaller and larger translational steps. Molecules previously identified as stepping alternatively 74-0 nm were found to actually step 64-10 nm. Additional tilting often occurred without full steps, possibly indicating flexibility of the attached myosin heads or probing of their vicinity. Processive myosin V molecules sometimes shifted from the top to the side of actin, possibly to avoid an obstacle. The data indicate marked adaptability of this molecular motor to a nonuniform local environment and provide strong support for a straight-neck model of myosin V in which the lever arm of the leading head is tilted backwards at the prepowerstoke angle.

Functional connection between p53 and caspase-2 is essential for apoptosis
induced by DNA damage.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Recent findings have established caspase-2 as an important apical regulator in apoptotic pathways leading from DNA damage to release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and subsequent activation of effector caspases. Yet, the molecular map connecting the embarking stimuli of genotoxic stress with caspase-2 activation remains to be elucidated. Here, we address the question of potential caspase-2 regulators by examining 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced apoptosis in wild-type and p53-deficient human colon carcinoma cells. Apoptosis was observed only in p53(+/+) cells and was preceded by caspase-2 activation. Hence, although no direct interaction between p53 and caspase-2 was observed in the cell system used, our data clearly demonstrate that a functional connection between these two proteins is essential for initiation of the 5-FU-induced apoptotic process. Proposed mediators of caspase-2 activation include PIDDosome complex proteins PIDD and RAIDD. Surprisingly, the presence of a complex encompassing at least RAIDD, PIDD and caspase-2 was verified in both p53(+/+) and p53(-/-) cells, also in the absence of 5-FU treatment. Thus, our results confirm the participation of PIDD and RAIDD in PIDDosome complex formation but question their role as sole mediators of caspase-2 activation. This assumption was further supported by siRNA transfections targeting PIDD or RAIDD. In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis of p53 as an upstream regulator of caspase activity and provide data concerning caspase-2 processing mechanisms. As suppression of caspase-2 expression in 5-FU-treated cells also affects the level of the p53 protein, possibilities of a reciprocal interaction between these proteins are discussed.Oncogene (2006) 25, 5683-5692. doi:10.1038/sj.onc.1209569; published online 1 May 2006.

<ABSTRACT>
Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are fatal autosomal recessive diseases and are caused by impaired peroxisome biogenesis. PBDs are genetically heterogeneous and classified into 13 complementation groups (CGs). CG8 is one of the most common groups and has three clinical phenotypes, including Zellweger syndrome (ZS), neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum disease (IRD). We recently isolated PEX26 as the pathogenic gene for PBD of CG8. Pex26p functions in recruiting to peroxisomes the complexes of the AAA ATPase peroxins, Pex1p and Pex6p. In the present work, we identified four distinct mutations in PEX26 from five patients of CG8 PBD including 2 with ZS and 3 with IRD, in addition to 7 mutant alleles in 8 patients in the first report describing the pathogenic PEX26 gene for CG8 PBD. Phenotype-genotype analyses revealed that temperature-sensitive (ts) peroxisome assembly gave rise to a milder IRD in contrast to the non-ts phenotype of the cells from ZS patients. Furthermore, we present several lines of evidence that show that the instability, insufficient binding to Pex1p x Pex6p complexes, or mislocalization of patient-derived Pex26p mutants is most likely responsible for the CG8 PBDs.

Production of the antimalarial drug precursor artemisinic acid in
engineered yeast.

<ABSTRACT>
Malaria is a global health problem that threatens 300-500 million people and kills more than one million people annually. Disease control is hampered by the occurrence of multi-drug-resistant strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Synthetic antimalarial drugs and malarial vaccines are currently being developed, but their efficacy against malaria awaits rigorous clinical testing. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide extracted from Artemisia annua L (family Asteraceae; commonly known as sweet wormwood), is highly effective against multi-drug-resistant Plasmodium spp., but is in short supply and unaffordable to most malaria sufferers. Although total synthesis of artemisinin is difficult and costly, the semi-synthesis of artemisinin or any derivative from microbially sourced artemisinic acid, its immediate precursor, could be a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, high-quality and reliable source of artemisinin. Here we report the engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce high titres (up to 100 mg l(-1)) of artemisinic acid using an engineered mevalonate pathway, amorphadiene synthase, and a novel cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP71AV1) from A. annua that performs a three-step oxidation of amorpha-4,11-diene to artemisinic acid. The synthesized artemisinic acid is transported out and retained on the outside of the engineered yeast, meaning that a simple and inexpensive purification process can be used to obtain the desired product. Although the engineered yeast is already capable of producing artemisinic acid at a significantly higher specific productivity than A. annua, yield optimization and industrial scale-up will be required to raise artemisinic acid production to a level high enough to reduce artemisinin combination therapies to significantly below their current prices.

Clusters of PE and PPE genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are organized

<ABSTRACT>
About 10% of the coding capacity of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) genome is devoted to the PE/PPE family of genes scattered throughout the genome. We have identified 28 PE/PPE operons which are organized within the M. tb genome in such a way that most PE members are upstream to PPE members. One example of such a gene arrangement is the PPE gene Rv2430c, earlier shown by us to code for a highly antigenic protein eliciting strong B-cell responses in TB patients [Choudhary, R.K., Mukhopadhyay, S., Chakhaiyar, P., Sharma, N., Murthy, K.J.R., Katoch V.M. and Hasnain, S.E. (2003) PPE antigen Rv2430c of Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces a strong B cell response. Infect. Immun. 71, 6338-6343], situated downstream to PE gene Rv2431c. Rv2431c and Rv2430c are transcribed as an operon. Expression of either rRv2431c or rRv2430c alone in E. coli limited their localization to the inclusion bodies. However, when they were co-expressed, both the proteins appeared in the soluble fraction. These two proteins interact with each other and form oligomers when alone, however, when present together they exist as heteromer.

RNA editing associated with the generation of two distinct conformations
of the trypanosomatid Leptomonas collosoma 7SL RNA.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Analysis of the trypanosomatid Leptomonas collosoma 7SL RNA revealed the existence of two distinct stable 7SL RNA conformers (7SL I and II). Sequence analysis of the RNAs indicated a single base difference between the conformers at position 133 (C in 7SL II and U in 7SL I) located in domain III. This change appears to be the result of a post-transcriptional editing event, since the single-copy 7SL RNA gene codes exclusively for a C at this position. The edited form (7SL I) was found preferentially in the cytoplasm, and the pre-edited form in the nucleus. 7SL I is mainly bound to ribosomes, whereas 7SL II is more abundant in ribosome-free particles. Mutations introduced in regions outside the editing site were found to occur in a single conformation, suggesting that the editing event is not the only factor that determines the conformation of the molecule. This study is the first description of an editing event on a small RNA other than tRNA and is the first report of C --> U editing in trypanosomes. We propose a novel role for RNA editing in controlling the conformation of the 7SL RNA in vivo.

<ABSTRACT>
The skl gene from Streptococcus mitis SK137 encodes a peptidoglycan hydrolase (Skl) that has been purified and biochemically characterized. Analysis of the degradation products obtained by digestion of pneumococcal cell walls with Skl revealed that this enzyme is an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28), showing optimum activity at 30 degrees C and at a pH of 6.5. Skl is a unique member of the choline-binding family of proteins since it contains a cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases (CHAP) domain. The CHAP domain of Skl showed homology to lysins of unknown especificity from a variety of streptococcal prophages. Skl represents the first characterized member of a new subfamily of CHAP-containing choline-binding proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Previous work has indicated that the PDZ domain Tax interacting protein 1 (Tip-1) is a target of the HTLV1 Tax protein and is a potential RhoA effector. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to show that Tip-1 also interacts with the HPV16 E6 protein. This interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from E6 expressing C33A cervical carcinoma cells (C33A-E6) which showed that Tip-1 was not degraded by interaction with the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein. During routine passage we observed that C33A-E6 had a less compact morphology and were less adherent than control vector transfected cells C33A-V cells - a known effect of GTP-RhoA. Comparison of C33A-E6 to C33A-V demonstrated that E6 expressing cells had higher levels of phosphorylated myosin light chains (MLC) and increased cell motility, which was inhibited by antisense silencing of Tip-1 expression and by the RhoA kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y27632. Both C33A-E6 and C33A-V cells were shown to express GTP activated RhoA. Since ROCKs can be activated by GTP RhoA these data indicate that E6 may increase cell motility by augmenting GTP RhoA mediated activation of ROCKs and that this is dependent on the expression of the Tip-1 protein.

Rational development of beta-peptide inhibitors of human cytomegalovirus
entry.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a pervasive and significant pathogen. At present, there is no HCMV vaccine, and the available drugs target only replication events. Thus, new therapeutic strategies are needed. HCMV fusion appears to require interactions of alpha-helical regions in viral surface glycoproteins gB and gH. Oligomers of beta-amino acids ("beta-peptides") are attractive unnatural scaffolds for mimicry of specific protein surfaces, because beta-peptides adopt predictable helical conformations and resist proteolysis. Here, we report the development of beta-peptides designed to mimic the gB heptad repeat and block HCMV entry. The most potent beta-peptide inhibits HCMV infection in a cell based-assay with an IC50 of approximately 30 microm. Consistent with our structure-based design strategy, inhibition is highly specific for HCMV relative to other related viruses. Mechanistic studies indicate that inhibitory beta-peptides act by disrupting membrane fusion. Our findings raise the possibility that beta-peptides may provide a general platform for development of a new class of antiviral agents and that inhibitory beta-peptides will constitute new tools for elucidating viral entry mechanisms.

<ABSTRACT>
We isolated and characterized four new PKCdelta isoforms, PKCdeltaIV, deltaV, deltaVI, and deltaVII, specifically expressed in the mouse testis. These isoforms possess neither V1 nor C2-like domains. Moreover, PKCdeltaVI and deltaVII have a different last exon as their V5 domain. The transcription of PKCdeltaIV, deltaV, deltaVI, and deltaVII is initiated from the same site in the upstream region of exon4 of the PKCdelta gene. They are expressed exclusively in the testis in an age-dependent manner. PKCdeltaIV and deltaV are expressed in spermatids with sperm maturation stage-specific manner, and that PKCdeltaVI and deltaVII are expressed in spermatogonia and spermatocytes.

Altered neuregulin 1-erbB4 signaling contributes to NMDA receptor
hypofunction in schizophrenia.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Recent molecular genetics studies implicate neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its receptor erbB in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Among NRG1 receptors, erbB4 is of particular interest because of its crucial roles in neurodevelopment and in the modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling. Here, using a new postmortem tissue-stimulation approach, we show a marked increase in NRG1-induced activation of erbB4 in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia. Levels of NRG1 and erbB4, however, did not differ between schizophrenia and control groups. To evaluate possible causes for this hyperactivation of erbB4 signaling, we examined the association of erbB4 with PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein of 95 kDa), as this association has been shown to facilitate activation of erbB4. Schizophrenia subjects showed substantial increases in erbB4-PSD-95 interactions. We found that NRG1 stimulation suppresses NMDA receptor activation in the human prefrontal cortex, as previously reported in the rodent cortex. NRG1-induced suppression of NMDA receptor activation was more pronounced in schizophrenia subjects than in controls, consistent with enhanced NRG1-erbB4 signaling seen in this illness. Therefore, these findings suggest that enhanced NRG1 signaling may contribute to NMDA hypofunction in schizophrenia.

ORF17 from the clavulanic acid biosynthesis gene cluster catalyzes the
ATP-dependent formation of N-glycyl-clavaminic acid.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
(3R,5R)-Clavulanic acid, a clinically used inhibitor of serine beta-lactamases, is produced by fermentation of Streptomyces clavuligerus. The early steps in clavulanic acid biosynthesis leading to the bicyclic beta-lactam intermediate (3S,5S)-clavaminic acid have been defined. However, the mechanism by which (3S,5S)-clavaminic acid is converted to the penultimate intermediate (3R,5R)-clavaldehyde is unclear. Disruption of orf15 or orf16, of the clavulanic acid biosynthesis gene cluster, blocks clavulanic acid production and leads to the accumulation of N-acetyl-glycyl-clavaminic acid and N-glycyl-clavaminic acid, suggesting that these compounds are intermediates in the pathway. Two alternative start codons have been proposed for orf17 to encode for two possible polypeptides, one of which has 92 N-terminal residues less then the other. The shorter version of orf17 was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as a monomeric protein. Sequence analyses predicting the ORF17 protein to be a member of the ATP-grasp fold superfamily were supported by soft ionization mass spectrometric analyses that demonstrated binding of ATP to the ORF17 protein. Semisynthetic clavaminic acid, prepared by in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthetic pathway from the synthetically accessible intermediate proclavaminic acid, was shown by mass spectrometric analyses to be converted to N-glycyl-clavaminic acid in the presence of ORF17, ATP, and glycine. Under the same conditions N-acetyl-glycine and clavaminic acid were not converted to N-acetyl-glycyl-clavaminic acid. The specificity of ORF17 as an N-glycyl-clavaminic acid synthetase, together with the reported accumulation of N-glycyl-clavaminic acid in orf15 and orf16 disruption mutants, suggested that N-glycyl-clavaminic acid is an intermediate in clavulanic acid biosynthesis.

<ABSTRACT>
ClyA is a pore-forming toxin from virulent Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica strains. Here, we show that the intrinsic hemolytic activity of ClyA is independent of its redox state, and that the assembly of both reduced and oxidized ClyA to the ring-shaped oligomer is triggered by contact with lipid or detergent. A rate-limiting conformational transition in membrane-bound ClyA monomers precedes their assembly to the functional pore. We obtained a three-dimensional model of the detergent-induced oligomeric complex at 12 A resolution by combining cryo- and negative stain electron microscopy with mass measurements by scanning transmission electron microscopy. The model reveals that 13 ClyA monomers assemble into a cylinder with a hydrophobic cap region, which may be critical for membrane insertion.

The structure of Prp40 FF1 domain and its interaction with the crn-TPR1
motif of Clf1 gives a new insight into the binding mode of FF domains.
</TITLE>

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The yeast splicing factor Prp40 (pre-mRNA processing protein 40) consists of a pair of WW domains followed by several FF domains. The region comprising the FF domains has been shown to associate with the 5' end of U1 small nuclear RNA and to interact directly with two proteins, the Clf1 (Crooked neck-like factor 1) and the phosphorylated repeats of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (CTD-RNAPII). In this work we reported the solution structure of the first FF domain of Prp40 and the identification of a novel ligand-binding site in FF domains. By using chemical shift assays, we found a binding site for the N-terminal crooked neck tetratricopeptide repeat of Clf1 that is distinct and structurally separate from the previously identified CTD-RNAPII binding pocket of the FBP11 (formin-binding protein 11) FF1 domain. No interaction, however, was observed between the Prp40 FF1 domain and three different peptides derived from the CTD-RNAPII protein. Indeed, the equivalent CTD-RNAPII-binding site in the Prp40 FF1 domain is predominantly negatively charged and thus unfavorable for an interaction with phosphorylated peptide sequences. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree reconstructions using the FF domains of three functionally related proteins, Prp40, FBP11, and CA150, revealed that Prp40 and FBP11 are not orthologous proteins and supported the different ligand specificities shown by their respective FF1 domains. Our results also revealed that not all FF domains in Prp40 are functionally equivalent. We proposed that at least two different interaction surfaces exist in FF domains that have evolved to recognize distinct binding motifs.

Decreased subunit stability as a novel mechanism for potassium current

<ABSTRACT>
KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 K+ channel subunits underlie the muscarinic-regulated K+ current (I(KM)), a widespread regulator of neuronal excitability. Mutations in KCNQ2- or KCNQ3-encoding genes cause benign familiar neonatal convulsions (BFNCs), a rare autosomal-dominant idiopathic epilepsy of the newborn. In the present study, we have investigated, by means of electrophysiological, biochemical, and immunocytochemical techniques in transiently transfected cells, the consequences prompted by a BFNC-causing 1-bp deletion (2043deltaT) in the KCNQ2 gene; this frameshift mutation caused the substitution of the last 163 amino acids of the KCNQ2 C terminus and the extension of the subunit by additional 56 residues. The 2043deltaT mutation abolished voltage-gated K+ currents produced upon homomeric expression of KCNQ2 subunits, dramatically reduced the steady-state cellular levels of KCNQ2 subunits, and prevented their delivery to the plasma membrane. Metabolic labeling experiments revealed that mutant KCNQ2 subunits underwent faster degradation; 10-h treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (20 microm) at least partially reversed such enhanced degradation. Co-expression with KCNQ3 subunits reduced the degradation rate of mutant KCNQ2 subunits and led to their expression on the plasma membrane. Finally, co-expression of KCNQ2 2043deltaT together with KCNQ3 subunits generated functional voltage-gated K+ currents having pharmacological and biophysical properties of heteromeric channels. Collectively, the present results suggest that mutation-induced reduced stability of KCNQ2 subunits may cause epilepsy in neonates.

Deregulation of proteasome function induces Abl-mediated cell death by
uncoupling p130CAS and c-CrkII.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cell migration and survival are coordinately regulated through activation of c-Abl (Abl) family tyrosine kinases. Activated Abl phosphorylates tyrosine 221 of c-CrkII (Crk; Crk-Y221-P), which prevents Crk from binding to the docking protein p130(CAS) (CAS). Disruption of CAS-Crk binding blocks downstream effectors of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion assembly, inhibits cell migration, and disrupts survival signals leading to apoptosis. Here we show that inhibition of the 26 S proteasome and ubiquitination facilitates Abl-mediated Crk-Y221-P, leading to disassembly of CAS-Crk complexes in cells. Surprisingly, inhibition of these molecular interactions does not perturb cell migration but rather specifically induces apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that attachment to an extracellular matrix plays a key role in regulating the apoptotic machinery through caspase-mediated cleavage of Abl and Crk-Y221-P. Our findings indicate that regulated protein degradation by the proteasome specifically controls cell death through regulation of Abl-mediated Crk Tyr221 phosphorylation and assembly of the CAS-Crk signaling scaffold.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Centrin is an essential component of microtubule-organizing centers in organisms ranging from algae and yeast to humans. It is an EF-hand calcium-binding protein with homology to calmodulin but distinct calcium binding properties. In a previously proposed model, the C-terminal domain of centrin serves as a constitutive anchor to target proteins, and the N-terminal domain serves as the sensor of calcium signals. The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain of Chlamydomonas rheinhardtii centrin has been determined in the presence of calcium by solution NMR spectroscopy. The domain is found to occupy an open conformation typical of EF-hand calcium sensors. Comparison of the N- and C-terminal domains of centrin reveals a structural and biochemical basis for the domain specificity of interactions with its cellular targets and the distinct nature of centrin relative to other EF-hand proteins. An NMR titration of the centrin N-terminal domain with a fragment of the known centrin target Sfi1 reveals binding of the peptide to a discrete site on the protein, which supports the proposal that the N-terminal domain serves as a calcium sensor in centrin.

The role of receptor internalization in CD95 signaling.

NONE
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Activation of the cell surface CD95 receptor triggers a cascade of signaling events, including assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), that culminate in cellular apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrate a general requirement of receptor internalization for CD95 ligand-mediated DISC amplification, caspase activation and apoptosis in type I cells. Recruitment of DISC components to the activated receptor predominantly occurs after the receptor has moved into an endosomal compartment and blockade of CD95 internalization impairs DISC formation and apoptosis. In contrast, CD95 ligand stimulation of cells unable to internalize CD95 results in activation of proliferative Erk and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Hence, the subcellular localization and internalization pathways of CD95 play important roles in controlling activation of distinct signaling cascades to determine divergent cellular fates.

<ABSTRACT>
Annexin A8 is a poorly characterized member of the annexin family of Ca2+-regulated membrane binding proteins. Initially only identified at the cDNA level it had been tentatively linked to acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) due to its high and regulated expression in APL-derived cells. Here we identify unique properties of the annexin A8 protein. We show that it binds Ca2+-dependently and with high specificity to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and is also capable of interacting with F-actin. In line with these characteristics annexin A8 is recruited to F-actin-associated PtdIns(4,5)P2-rich membrane domains formed in HeLa cells upon infection with non-invading enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. These properties suggest a role of annexin A8 in the organization of certain actin-associated membrane domains.
