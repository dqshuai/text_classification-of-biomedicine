<ABSTRACT>
Weakly bound cell wall proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana were identified using a proteomic and bioinformatic approach. An efficient protocol of extraction based on vacuum-infiltration of the tissues was developed. Several salts and a chelating agent were compared for their ability to extract cell wall proteins without releasing cytoplasmic contaminants. Of the 93 proteins that were identified, a large proportion (60%) was released by calcium chloride. From bioinformatics analysis, it may be predicted that most of them (87 out of 93) had a signal peptide, whereas only six originated from the cytoplasm. Among the putative apoplastic proteins, a high proportion (67 out of 87) had a basic pI. Numerous glycoside hydrolases and proteins with interacting domains were identified, in agreement with the expected role of the extracellular matrix in polysaccharide metabolism and recognition phenomena. Ten proteinases were also found as well as six proteins with unknown functions. Comparison of the cell wall proteome of rosettes with the previously published cell wall proteome of cell suspension cultures showed a high level of cell specificity, especially for the different members of several large multigenic families.

<ABSTRACT>
Polarized epithelial cells are responsible for the vectorial transport of solutes and have a key role in maintaining body fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Such cells contain structurally and functionally distinct plasma membrane domains. Brush border and basolateral membranes of renal and intestinal epithelial cells can be separated using a number of different separation techniques, which allow their different transport functions and receptor expressions to be studied. In this communication, we report a proteomic analysis of these two membrane segments, apical and basolateral, obtained from the rat renal cortex isolated by two different methods: differential centrifugation and free-flow electrophoresis. The study was aimed at assessing the nature of the major proteins isolated by these two separation techniques. Two analytical strategies were used: separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) at the protein level or by cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after proteolysis (i.e., at the peptide level). Proteolytic peptides derived from the proteins present in gel pieces or from HPLC fractions after proteolysis were sequenced by on-line liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Several hundred proteins were identified in each membrane section. In addition to proteins known to be located at the apical and basolateral membranes, several novel proteins were also identified. In particular, a number of proteins with putative roles in signal transduction were identified in both membranes. To our knowledge, this is the first reported study to try and characterize the membrane proteome of polarized epithelial cells and to provide a data set of the most abundant proteins present in renal proximal tubule cell membranes.

<ABSTRACT>
Birch pollen-related food allergies are mainly associated to Bet v 1. Little is known about isoforms of Bet v 1 homologous in fruit of the Rosaceae family. We attempted to identify novel isoforms of Pru av 1, the major cherry allergen, at the cDNA and the protein level by a combination of molecular biology and proteomic tools. A cDNA library was screened with patients immunoglobulin E (IgE) and a specific hybridization probe. Edman sequencing, mass spectrometry (MS), and MS/MS were performed after detecting Pru av 1 on 2-D maps by immunoblotting using patients IgE and a monoclonal antibody. Partial amino acid sequences were completed with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy. The IgE-binding properties of the Pru av 1 spots were analyzed by 2-D blot inhibition. cDNA library analysis revealed a novel Pru av 1 isoform. MS and N-terminal sequencing confirmed the cDNA sequences at the protein level. A series of spots were confirmed as the already known Pru av 1. One spot, exclusively detected with patients sera, was identified as the novel isoform. A partial amino acid sequence detected with MS/MS was completed by PCR-cloning. The 2-D blot inhibition revealed epitope differences between the novel isoform and the previously published Pru av 1. Our data demonstrate that a synergistic combination of molecular biology and proteomics represents a powerful tool for reliable and comprehensive identification of allergen isoforms and variants. The newly identified isoform showed diverging IgE-binding properties and may be relevant for the diagnosis or therapy of cherry allergy.

<ABSTRACT>
In order to reveal the mechanisms of the extreme radioresistance and DNA repair in Deinococcus radiodurans, we examined proteome changes in a wild-type strain following gamma-irradiation using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Silver-staining. The expression levels of 26 protein spots showed significant changes under radiation stress. Of these spots, 21 were identified with peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry after tryptic in-gel digestion. These proteins exhibited various cellular functions, including (i) translation; (ii) transcription; (iii) signal transduction; (iv) post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones; (v) carbohydrate transport and metabolism; (vi) energy production and conversion; (vii) nucleotide transport and metabolism; (viii) inorganic ion transport and metabolism; (ix) DNA replication, recombination and repair; and (x) yet unknown. Most of the proteins have not previously been reported to be relevant to radioresistance.

Proteomic analysis of the proliferative and secretory phases of the human

Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):270-81.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteomic analyses of the proliferative and secretory phases of the human endometrium were carried out to identify proteins and discover differentially expressed proteins using isotope-coded affinity tags, three stages of chromatographic separation and online tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). From an initial list of 346 proteins identified by ProICAT, manual inspection of MS/MS spectra and confirmatory searches pared the list down to 119 positively identified proteins. Only five of the proteins showed consistent differential expression. The utility of some of these proteins as indicators of true differential expression in the endometrium is open to discussion. The two proteins with unquestionable differential expressions in the secretory endometrium are: glutamate NMDA receptor subunit zeta 1 precursor and FRAT1. Some of the proteins that show no differential expression have previously been examined in gene-expression studies with similar conclusions.

Partial hepatectomy induced liver proteome changes in mice.

Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):318-25.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Acceleration of liver regeneration could be of great clinical benefit in various liver-associated diseases. However, at present little is known about therapeutic interventions to enhance this regenerative process. Our limited understanding and the complexity of the mechanisms involved have prevented the identification of new targets for treatment. Here we propose a broad-range proteomic approach to this problem that makes possible the simultaneous study of different signaling and metabolic pathways on the liver proteome. Changes in protein expression in mouse livers (n = 5 per group) at 6 h and 12 h after partial hepatectomy and sham operation, as compared to untreated controls, were analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry (MS), and mass fingerprinting. Twelve proteins, identified by MS, were up-regulated by at least 2-fold after partial hepatectomy. These included adipose differentiation-related protein, gamma-actin, enoyl coenzyme A hydratase 1, serum amyloid A and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3. These results indicate that liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy affects various signaling and metabolic pathways.

<ABSTRACT>
Tandem mass spectrometry is a method of choice for rapid analysis in proteomics. Identification and characterization of proteins from organisms with sequenced genomes is today a routine procedure as will be identification of proteins from organisms with unsequenced genomes with new developing tools. Here, we report the use of isotopic labeling with electrospray ionisation (ESI)-tandem mass spectrometry for de novo sequencing in combination with database search taking advantage of different programs for identification of fungal proteins. Using this approach we could identify the proteins of interest. Nevertheless, the identification of a novel protein responsible for the conversion of testosterone into androstenedione was still a difficult task, mostly due to the low homology of steroid transforming enzymes, especially those from microorganisms. Protein p27 was identified as the vanillate O-demethylase oxidoreductase, p33 and p36 as two isoenzymes of malate dehydrogenase, and p45 as citrate synthase. By rechecking the sequences using additional programs it could be shown that the protein p36 has a higher local homology to the steroid-transforming enzyme than to the malate dehydrogenase. Therefore, we assume that p36 is a pluripotent enzyme most probably responsible for the 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity.

mass spectrometry of proteins detected by immunostaining on

Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):55-66.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have developed an approach that allows peptide mass mapping by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry of proteins visualized on a nitrocellulose membrane by immunochemical detection. Proteins are separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and after blocking with a nonprotein-containing polymer such as polyvinylpyrrolidone 40 (PVP-40) or Tween 20, the proteins are stained with fount India ink. After incubation with primary and, if required, secondary peroxidase-coupled antibodies, immunochemically reactive proteins can be visualized using conventional enhanced chemiluminescence detection and assigned to the India ink-stained membrane by simple superposition. The proteins of interest are excised, submitted to "on-membrane" cleavage and the peptides are analyzed by mass spectrometry. Protein-based blocking reagents normally used in standard immunodetection protocols, such as skimmed milk, can be employed. We have obtained high-quality mass spectra of bovine serum albumin (BSA) detected on an immunoblot with an estimated amount of 100 fmol applied onto the gel, indicating the sensitivity of the present method. In addition, the approach is demonstrated with two other commercially available proteins, a serum protein, the successful identification of a tyrosine phosphorylated protein from total rat liver homogenate and serine phosphorylated proteins from an EcR 293 nuclear extract separated by two-dimensional (2-D) SDS-PAGE.

Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):222-34.

<ABSTRACT>
As a first approach in establishing the holm oak leaf proteome, we have optimised a protocol for this plant and tissue which includes the following steps: trichloroacetic acid-acetone extraction, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) on pH 5 to 8 linear gradient immobilised pH gradient strips as the first dimension, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 13% polyacrylamide gels as the second one. Proteins were detected by Coomassie staining. Gel images were recorded and digitalized, and the protein spots quantified by using a linear regression equation of protein quantity on spot volume obtained against standard proteins. Analytical variance was calculated for one-hundred protein spots from three replicate 2-DE gels of the same protein extract. Biological variance was determined for the same protein spots from independent tissue extracts corresponding to leaves from different trees, or the same tree at different orientations or sampling times during a day. Values of 26% for the analytical variance and 58.6% for the biological variance among independent trees were obtained. These values provide a quantified and statistical basis for the evaluation of protein expression changes in comparative proteomic investigations with this species. A representative set of the major proteins, covering the isoelectric point range of 5 to 8 and the relative molecular mass(r) range of 14 to 78 kDa, were subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Due to the absence of Quercus DNA or protein sequence databases, a method based on the procedure reported by Liska and Shevchenko including de novo sequencing and BLAST similarity searching against other plant species databases was used for protein identification. Out of 43 analysed spots, 35 were positively identified. The identified proteins mainly corresponded to enzymes involved in photosynthesis and energetic metabolism, with a significant number corresponding to RubisCO.

<ABSTRACT>
Subcellular localization represents an essential, albeit often neglected, aspect of proteome analysis. Generally, the subcellular location of proteins determines the function of cells and tissues. Here we present a robust and versatile prefractionation protocol for mammalian cells and tissues which is appropriate for minute sample amounts. The protocol yields three fractions: a nuclear, a cytoplasmic, and a combined membrane and organelle fraction. The subcellular specificity and the composition of the fractions were demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of five marker proteins and analysis of 43 proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. To cover all protein species, both conventional two-dimensional and benzyldimethyl-n-hexadecyl ammonium chloride-sodium dodecyl sulfate (16-BAC-SDS) gel electrophoresis were performed. Integral membrane proteins and strongly basic nuclear histones were detected only in the 16-BAC-SDS gel electrophoresis system, confirming its usefulness for proteome analysis. All but one protein complied to the respective subcellular composition of the analyzed fractions. Taken together, the data make our subcellular prefractionation protocol an attractive alternative to other prefractionation methods which are based on less physiological protein properties.

Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):113-22.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (GEM) are membrane entities that concentrate glycosylphosphatiolylinositol(GPI)-anchored, acylated and membrane proteins important for immune receptor signaling. Using rat leukemic cell line RNK-16 we have initiated proteomic studies of microdomains in natural killer (NK) cells. Isolated plasma membranes were treated with Brij 58, or Nonidet-P40, or sodium carbonate. Extracts were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation into very light membrane, medium light membrane and heavy fractions, and a complete protein profile was analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Up to 250 proteins were unambiguously identified in each analyzed fraction. The first study of the proteome of NK cell GEM revealed several new aspects including identification of molecules not expected to be expressed in rat NK cells (e.g., NAP-22) or associated with GEM (e.g., NKR-P1, CD45, CD2). Moreover, it provided clear data consolidating controversial views concerning the occurrence of major histcompatibility complex glycoproteins and RT6.1/CD73/CD38 complex in NK cells. Our results also identified a large number of receptors as candidates for future functional studies.

A novel strategy for quantitative proteomics using isotope-coded protein

Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):4-15.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Stable isotope labelling in combination with mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful tool to identify and relatively quantify thousands of proteins within complex protein mixtures. Here we describe a novel method, termed isotope-coded protein label (ICPL), which is capable of high-throughput quantitative proteome profiling on a global scale. Since ICPL is based on stable isotope tagging at the frequent free amino groups of isolated intact proteins, it is applicable to any protein sample, including extracts from tissues or body fluids, and compatible to all separation methods currently employed in proteome studies. The method showed highly accurate and reproducible quantification of proteins and yielded high sequence coverage, indispensable for the detection of post-translational modifications and protein isoforms. The efficiency (e.g. accuracy, dynamic range, sensitivity, speed) of the approach is demonstrated by comparative analysis of two differentially spiked proteomes.

Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):198-211.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The human oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis colonizes the gingival crevice and invades gingival epithelial cells. Multidimensional capillary high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were used to analyze the proteome of P. gingivalis as it adapts to a set of experimental conditions designed to reflect important features of an epithelial cell environment. 1014 proteins (46% of the total theoretical proteome) were identified in four independent analyses; 479 of these proteins showed evidence of differential expression after exposure of P. gingivalis to either conditioned epithelial cell growth medium or control conditions: i.e., they were only detected under one set of conditions. Moreover, 276 genes annotated as hypothetical were found to encode expressed proteins. Among the proteins up-regulated in the presence of epithelial cell components were a homolog of the internalin proteins of Listeria monocytogenes and subunits of the ATP-dependent Clp protease complex. Insertional inactivation of clpP, encoding the Clp proteolytic subunit, resulted in approximately a 50% reduction in invasion of P. gingivalis. These results suggest that adaptation to an epithelial cell environment induces a major shift in the expressed proteome of the organism. Furthermore, ClpP, that is up-regulated in this environment, is required for optimal invasive activity of P. gingivalis.

The membrane proteome of Halobacterium salinarum.

Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):180-97.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The identification of 114 integral membrane proteins from Halobacterium salinarum was achieved using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) techniques, representing 20% of the predicted alpha-helical transmembrane proteins of the genome. For this experiment, a membrane preparation with only minor contamination by soluble proteins was prepared. From this membrane preparation a number of peripheral membrane proteins were identified by the classical two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) approach, but identification of integral membrane proteins largely failed with only a very few being identified. By use of a fluorescently labeled membrane preparation, we document that this is caused by an irreversible precipitation of the membrane proteins upon isoelectric focusing (IEF). Attempts to overcome this problem by using alternative IEF methods and IEF strip solubilisation techniques were not successful, and we conclude that the classical 2-DE approach is not suited for the identification of integral membrane proteins. Computational analysis showed that the identification of integral membrane proteins is further complicated by the generation of tryptic peptides, which are unfavorable for matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometric peptide mass fingerprint analysis. Together with the result from the analysis of the cytosolic proteome (see preceding paper), we could identify 34% (943) of all gene products in H. salinarum which can be theoretically expressed. This is a cautious estimate as very stringent criteria were applied for identification. These results are available under www.halolex.mpg.de.

Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):258-69.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolism-based resistance in Drosophila melanogaster is a complex metabolic system associated with the transcription of detoxification related genes, ion transport, lipid and sugar metabolism pathways. However, little is known about the differences regarding the proteome of field- and laboratory-selected resistant Drosophila genotypes. We investigated the impact of DDT resistance in the abundant proteome of field- and laboratory- selected resistant Drosophila using a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis DDT reference map. Proteomic profiling was performed in two DDT susceptible genotypes (Canton-S and 91-C) and three DDT resistant lines (Rst(2)DDT(91-R), Rst(2)DDT(Wisconsin) and Rst(2)DDT(Hikone-R)). Protein spots were stained with Coomassie blue and compared using PDQuest software. Selected protein spots were cut out and analyzed using matrix assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry. Querying the NCBInr. 10.21.2003 database with mass spectrometric data yielded the identity of 21 differentially translated proteins in Rst(2)DDT(91-R), Rst(2)DDT(Wisconsin) and Canton-S representing proteins putatively involved in biochemical pathways such as glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the Krebs cycle and fatty acid oxidation. We hypothesize that both strategies are aimed to use of the pentose phosphate pathway to increase glucose utilization while Rst(2)DDT(91-R) relies primarily on glycolysis to produce reduced NADP and increase DDT detoxification. DDT exposure in Canton-S induced six proteins, while four proteins were repressed in Rst(2)DDT(Hikone-R). Our data suggest that insecticide resistance appears to impact different metabolic pathways in Drosophila genotypes selected with the same pesticide (DDT).

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The extracellular proteome of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) cultivated in minimal medium was isolated from the cell-free culture supernatant and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. This technique resolved 97 clearly visible protein spots, which were excised, digested with trypsin and identified on the basis of their peptide mass fingerprints generated by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight-mass spectrometry. Using this approach 87 different proteins could be distinguished. The Signal P software predicted putative signal peptides for 53% of the extracellular proteins. These proteins are probably transported over the inner membrane and are localized in the periplasm, the outer membrane or secreted into the extracellular space. Among the secreted proteins are 11 degradative enzymes, which are involved in pathogenesis of Xcc. The proteins without obvious secretion signals are known to serve functions in the cytosol. How the cytosolic proteins are delivered to the extracellular space remains unclear.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum (strain R1, DSM 671) contains 2784 protein-coding genes as derived from the genome sequence. The cytosolic proteome containing 2042 proteins was separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and systematically analyzed by a semi-automatic procedure. A reference map was established taking into account the narrow isoelectric point (pI) distribution of halophilic proteins between 3.5 and 5.5. Proteins were separated on overlapping gels covering the essential areas of pI and molecular weight. Every silver-stained spot was analyzed resulting in 661 identified proteins out of about 1800 different protein spots using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF). There were 94 proteins that were found in multiple spots, indicating post-translational modification. An additional 141 soluble proteins were identified on 2-D gels not corresponding to the reference map. Thus about 40% of the cytosolic proteome was identified. In addition to the 2784 protein-coding genes, the H. salinarum genome contains more than 6000 spurious open reading frames longer than 100 codons. Proteomic information permitted an improvement in genome annotation by validating and correcting gene assignments. The correlation between theoretical pI and gel position is exceedingly good and was used as a tool to improve start codon assignments. The fraction of identified chromosomal proteins was much higher than that of those encoded on the plasmids. In combination with analysis of the GC content this observation permitted an unambiguous identification of an episomal insert of 60 kbp ("AT-rich island") in the chromosome, as well as a 70 kbp region from the chromosome that has integrated into one of the megaplasmids and carries a series of essential genes. About 63% of the chromosomally encoded proteins larger than 25 kDa were identified, proving the efficacy of 2-DE MALDI-TOF MS PMF technology. The analysis of the integral membrane proteome by tandem mass spectrometric techniques added another 141 identified proteins not identified by the 2-DE approach (see following paper).

Comparison of different depletion strategies for improved resolution in

Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):307-17.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Serum proteins may often serve as indicators of disease and is a rich source for biomarker discovery. However, the large dynamic range of proteins in serum makes the analysis very challenging because high-abundant proteins tend to mask those of lower abundance. A prefractionation step, such as depletion of a few high-abundant proteins before protein profiling, can assist in the discovery and detection of less abundant proteins that may prove to be informative biomarkers. In the present study, five different depletion columns were investigated considering efficiency, specificity, and reproducibility. Our research included quantitative determination of total protein, albumin, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations, one- and two-dimensional gels and mass spectrometric analysis of the serum samples before and after the depletion step. Our results showed that all five depletion columns tested removed albumin and IgG with high efficiency. We found that based on reproducibility and binding specificity, the Multiple Affinity Removal Column that removed a total of six high-abundant proteins (albumin, IgG, antitrypsin, IgA, transferring, and haptoglobin) offered the most promising depletion approach. Among the disposable (single-use) products, the ProteoExtract Albumin/IgG Removal kit displayed the best results. Depleted serum from the Multiple Affinity Removal column was further evaluated by 2-D gel electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis, and the results indicated increased resolution and improved intensity of low-abundant proteins in a reproducible fashion. Our study provides a comprehensive investigation of commercially available depletion columns and will be of high importance for future proteomic studies on serum samples.

<ABSTRACT>
Bifidobacteria are Gram-positive prokaryotes that naturally colonize the human gut where they exert several health-promoting effects. The present paper reports the use of a strong cation exchange-reversed-phase-tandem mass spectrometry strategy to catalogue the most abundantly expressed proteins of a probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis strain. A global view of the B. infantis proteome was obtained. The bimodal representation of the proteins identified by mass spectrometry provides the first theoretical two-dimensional map of protein distribution for this organism. Among the 136 proteins identified by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) analysis, 118 showed the highest similarity with the translated sequences of B. longum genome, two proteins were similar to other Bifidobacterium species and the remaining 16 were similar to different genera. Specific biological activities have been assigned to 115 identified proteins, whereas 21 have been referred to the group of hypothetical proteins. The MudPIT approach allowed us to identify high mass and basic isoelectric point proteins that are generally challenging to visualize using the traditional two-dimensional electrophoresis technique. Redundancy in peptide and protein identification using the double chromatography technique was also evaluated.

Proteasome inhibition and Tau proteolysis: an unexpected regulation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):1-5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Increasing evidence suggests that an inhibition of the proteasome, as demonstrated in Parkinson's disease, might be involved in Alzheimer's disease. In this disease and other Tauopathies, Tau proteins are hyperphosphorylated and aggregated within degenerating neurons. In this state, Tau is also ubiquitinated, suggesting that the proteasome might be involved in Tau proteolysis. Thus, to investigate if proteasome inhibition leads to accumulation, hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of Tau, we used neuroblastoma cells overexpressing Tau proteins. Surprisingly, we showed that the inhibition of the proteasome led to a bidirectional degradation of Tau. Following this result, the cellular mechanisms that may degrade Tau were investigated.

A simple model for the cooperative stabilisation of actin filaments by
phalloidin and jasplakinolide.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):6-10.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The stabilisation of magnesium actin filaments by phalloidin and jasplakinolide was studied using the method of differential scanning calorimetry. The results showed that actin could adapt three conformations in the presence of drugs. One conformation was adapted in direct interaction with the drug, while another conformation was identical to that observed in the absence of drugs. A third conformation was induced through allosteric inter-protomer interactions. The effect of both drugs propagated cooperatively along the actin filaments. The number of the cooperative units determined by using a quantitative model was larger for jasplakinolide (15 actin protomers) than for phalloidin (7 protomers).

Possible role for avPGC-1alpha in the control of expression of fiber type,
along with avUCP and avANT mRNAs in the skeletal muscles of cold-exposed
chickens.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):11-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), a transcriptional coactivator, plays a role in mitochondrial biogenesis, muscle fiber specialization, and adaptive thermogenesis. Because of an absence of brown adipose tissue, the skeletal muscle tissue in chickens serves as an important source of thermogenesis to counter the cold. The present experiments were conducted (i) to clone the cDNA of PGC-1alpha homologs from chicken skeletal muscle and to examine alterations to PGC-1alpha mRNA expression in the skeletal muscles of cold-exposed chickens, (ii) to study the effect of cold-acclimation on the metabolic fiber phenotype of typically fast-glycolytic (type IIB) pectoralis muscles, and (iii) to compare avANT and avUCP mRNA expression in control and cold-exposed chickens. Results show that the cloned avPGC-1alpha cDNA encodes a 796 amino-acid protein (GenBank Accession No. AB170013) showing 84% identity with rodent PGC-1alpha cDNA. Exposure of chickens to a cold environment resulted in the prompt upregulation of avPGC-1alpha expression, which preceded increments in avUCP and avANT expression in skeletal muscle mitochondria. Consistent with the morphological appearance of muscles, an increase in the number of fast-oxidative-glycolytic (type IIA) fibers in the pectoralis muscle, which contains exclusively type IIB fibers in control chickens, was observed in cold-acclimated chickens. These findings provide novel information about possible regulatory pathways in avian skeletal muscle during thermogenesis.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):18-24.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Analysis of the O-chain subunit of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) isolated from Bordetella trematum, a recently identified human pathogen, was undertaken. The polysaccharide (PS) moiety was shown to contain only two O-chain subunits, which differed in the anomeric bond of their first sugar. A trisaccharide fragment resulting from the cleavage of a FucNAc glycosidic bond was isolated after treatment of the PS with anhydrous HF. Nitrous deamination of the LPS led to the release of the following heptasaccharide corresponding to two trisaccharide subunits linked to an anhydromannitol residue. beta-ManNAc3NAmA-(1-4)-beta-ManNAc3NAmA-(1-3)-alpha-FucNAc-(1-4)-beta-ManN Ac3NAmA-(1-4)-beta-ManNAc3NAmA-(1-3)-beta-FucNAc-(1-6)-2,5-anhManol.

protease activated receptor 4.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):25-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The angiotensin converting enzyme breakdown product of bradykinin, bradykinin 1-5 (RPPGF), inhibits thrombin-induced human or mouse platelet aggregation. RPPGF binds to the exodomain of human protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1). Studies determined if RPPGF also binds to the exodomain of human PAR4. RPPGF binds to a peptide of the thrombin cleavage site on PAR4. Recombinant wild-type and mutated exodomain of human PAR4 was prepared. The N-terminal arginine on RPPGF binds to the P2 position or proline46 on PAR4 to block thrombin cleavage. These data indicate that RPPGF influences thrombin activity by binding to the thrombin cleavage site on both PAR4 and PAR1.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We report here the complete nucleotide sequence of the 23.5-kb mitochondrial genome from the yeast Kluyveromyces thermotolerans. It encodes, all on the same DNA strand, three subunits of cytochrome oxidase (COX1, COX2 and COX3), three subunits of ATP synthetase (ATP6, ATP8 and ATP9), the apocytochrome b (COB), the ribosomal protein VAR1, 24 tRNAs, the small and large ribosomal RNAs, and the RNA subunit of RNase P. Three intronic ORFs are present within the COX1 gene group I introns. The K. thermotolerans mitochondrial genome is very similar to the Candida glabrata mitochondrial genome, as judged from clusters of gene order, gene transcription units and sequence similarities. Interestingly, the predicted secondary structure of the abnormal tRNAThr1 contains 10 nucleotides in its anticodon loop. This sequence is available under EMBL Accession No. AJ634268.

Zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein, a lipid mobilizing factor, is expressed and

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):41-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein (ZAG), a lipid mobilizing factor, is expressed in mouse adipose tissue and is markedly upregulated in mice with cancer cachexia. We have explored whether ZAG is expressed and secreted by human adipocytes, using SGBS cells, and examined the regulation of ZAG expression. ZAG mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in mature human adipocytes and in SGBS cells post-, but not pre-, differentiation to adipocytes. Relative ZAG mRNA levels increased rapidly after differentiation of SGBS cells, peaking at day 8 post-induction. ZAG protein was evident in differentiated adipocytes (by day 3) and also detected in the culture medium (by day 6) post-induction. The PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone induced a 3-fold increase in ZAG mRNA level, while TNF-alpha led to a 4-fold decrease. Human adipocytes express and secrete ZAG, with ZAG expression being regulated particularly through TNF-alpha and the PPARgamma nuclear receptor. ZAG is a novel adipokine, which may be involved in the local regulation of adipose tissue function.

Requirement of tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase-A for proper cuticle
formation in the nematode C. elegans.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):53-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Tyrosine O-sulfation is one of the post-translational modification processes that occur to membrane proteins and secreted proteins in eukaryotes. Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) is responsible for this modification, and in this report, we describe the expression pattern and the biological role of TPST-A in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that TPST-A was mainly expressed in the hypodermis, especially in the seam cells. Reduction of TPST-A activity by RNAi caused severe defects in cuticle formation, indicating that TPST-A is involved in the cuticle formation in the nematode. We found that RNAi of TPST-A suppressed the roller phenotype caused by mutations in the rol-6 collagen gene, suggesting that sulfation of collagen proteins may be important for proper organization of the extracellular cuticle matrix. The TPST-A RNAi significantly decreased the dityrosine level in the worms, raising the possibility that the sulfation process may be a pre-requisite for the collagen tyrosine cross-linking.

Phosphorylation of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol by phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase changes its properties as a substrate for phospholipases.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):59-65.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) phosphorylate the 3-position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to produce phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate. It is not clear whether PI3K can phosphorylate the inositol group in other biomolecules. We sought to determine whether PI3K was able to use glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) as a substrate. This phospholipid may exist either in free form (GPIfree) or forming a lipid anchor (GPIanchor) for the attachment of extracellular proteins to the plasma membrane. We demonstrate the specific PI3K-mediated phosphorylation of the inositol 3-hydroxyl group within both types of GPI by incubating this phospholipid with immunoprecipitated PI3K. The phosphorylated product behaves in HPLC as a derivative of a PI3K lipid product. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that PI3K uses lipid substrates other than phosphoinositides. Further, we show that this has potential functional consequences. When GPIfree is phosphorylated, it becomes a poorer substrate for GPI-specific phospholipase D, but a better substrate for phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. These phosphorylation events may constitute the basis of a previously undescribed signal transduction mechanism.

<ABSTRACT>
Erm, a member of the PEA3 group within the Ets family of transcription factors, is expressed in murine and human lymphocytes. Here, we show that in the human Molt4 lymphoblastic cell line, the erm gene expression is regulated by the conventional PKC (cPKC) pathway. To better characterize the molecular mechanism by which cPKC regulates Erm transcription in Molt4 cells, we tested proximal promoter deletions of the human gene, and identified a specific cPKC-regulated region between positions -420 and -115 upstream of the first exon.

cancer.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):71-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A new member of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: beta-galactose beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (beta3Gn-T) family having the beta3-glycosyltransferase motifs was identified using an in silico method. This novel beta3Gn-T was cloned from a human colon cancer cell line and named beta3Gn-T8 based on its position in a phylogenetic tree and enzymatic activity. Beta3Gn-T8 transfers GlcNAc to the non-reducing terminus of the Galbeta1-4GlcNAc of tetraantennary N-glycan in vitro. HCT15 cells transfected with beta3Gn-T8 cDNA showed an increase in reactivity to both LEA and PHA-L4 in a flow cytometric analysis. These results indicated that beta3Gn-T8 is involved in the biosynthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains on tetraantennary (beta1,6-branched) N-glycan. In most of the colorectal cancer tissues examined, the level of beta3Gn-T8 transcript was significantly higher than in normal tissue. Beta3Gn-T8 could be an enzyme involved in the synthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine on beta1-6 branched N-glycans in colon cancer.

<ABSTRACT>
The use of small molecule inhibitors in the study of cellular processes is a powerful approach to understanding gene function. During the course of a high throughput screen for novel inhibitors of eukaryotic translation, we identified a number of nucleic acid binding ligands that showed activity in our assay. When tested on a panel of mRNA transcripts displaying different modes of translation initiation, these ligands showed a range of biological activities--with some inhibiting both cap-dependent and internal initiation and others preferentially blocking internal initiation. We used this information to identify a novel threading intercalator that inhibits Hepatitis C virus internal initiation.

Distinct roles of the ERK pathway in modulating apoptosis of

<ABSTRACT>
Ectopic expression of oncogenic H-Ras in cells results in increases of cell susceptibility to the anticancer agent FR901228. Investigating the roles of Ras-induced pathways in FR901228-induced apoptosis, we have found that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway plays an anti-apoptotic role, whereas the stress-activated protein kinase p38 pathway plays a pro-apoptotic role in FR901228-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway plays an anti-apoptotic role in non-transformed cells; however, it plays a pro-apoptotic role in Ras-transformed cells in response to FR901228 treatment. An essential role of the ERK pathway in regulating caspase-3 contents may contribute to its pro-apoptotic role in Ras-transformed cells.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):95-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Phenotypic changes in injured livers involve complex network of genes whose interplays may lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis, a major risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Gene expression profiles in fibrotic livers were analyzed by using cDNA microarray, hierarchical clustering and gene ontology. Analyses of a major cluster of upregulated genes in cirrhosis identified a new set of genes involved in DNA repair and damage. The upregulation of DNA repair genes was confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and associated with necroinflammatory activity (P<0.001). Increased DNA repair activity in cirrhosis with inflammatory activity may reflect increased DNA damages as a consequence of chronic liver injury.

<ABSTRACT>
Proteins containing RPEL motifs (e.g., MAL) are important in the regulation of gene expression by the actin cytoskeleton. Screening the ENSEMBL database for RPEL proteins identified four additional proteins that contain RPEL motifs and nuclear localisation sequences, three of which (RPEL-A, RPEL-B and RPEL-C) are expressed in adult mouse tissues with different expression profiles. The mRNAs encoding RPEL-B and RPEL-C were subject to alternative splicing. Expression of these genes in cells indicated that they had a marked effect on cell shape. Furthermore, when expressed with a nuclear localised actin all of the different forms became restricted to the nucleus.

<ABSTRACT>
Hypoxic environment in solid tumor is known to favor cell survival and to initiate the formation of new capillaries. In this work, we identified by 2D gel analysis 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP94) as being upregulated in human endothelial cells in response to hypoxia. Three putative hypoxia responsive elements (HRE) were found in the GRP94 promoter. Competition experiments of HIF-1 DNA binding using specific probes containing each HRE sequence of the GRP94 promoter clearly evidenced that HIF-1 binds these sequences with high affinity. The human GRP94 promoter was then cloned upstream of the luciferase gene and showed enhanced activity in hypoxic conditions. Mutation of two of the three HREs present in this promoter completely inhibited the hypoxia-induced increase in luciferase activity.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):115-21.

<ABSTRACT>
Nervous system polycomb 1 (NSPc1) shares high homology with vertebrate PcG proteins Mel-18 and Bmi-1. The mRNA of NSPc1 is highly expressed in the developmental nervous system [Mech. Dev. 102 (2001) 219-222]. However, the functional characterization of NSPc1 protein is not clear. In the present study, using Western blotting technique, we aimed to describe the distributions of NSPc1 protein in rat tissues and cell lines. The subcellular localization of NSPc1 was examined in HeLa and SH-SY5Ycell lines, and its transcriptional repression activity was examined in COS-7 cell line. We found that the NSPc1 protein was localized mainly in the nucleus. NSPc1 remarkably repressed the transcription. Most interestingly, both the C-terminal of NSPc1 and two phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal, especially the PKC phosphorylation site at S183, were important in mediating transcription repression. Taken together, results from our study suggest that NSPc1, as a typical PcG family member, has powerful transcriptional repression ability, which may be related to the PKC signaling pathway.

Different role of functional domains of hTR in DNA binding to telomere and

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):127-32.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Even if template sequence of hTR played an essential role in telomere binding, a 326 nucleotide fragment of hTR containing template, pseudoknot, and CR4-5 domains is critical for both binding with telomeric DNA and reconstitution of telomerase activity. A functional study with antisense oligonucleotides suggested that targeted disruption of the template region efficiently abrogated both telomeric DNA binding and telomerase activity, whereas disruption of the CR4-5 region induced only loss of telomerase activity. hTR interacts with telomeric DNA via structural region composed of the template, pseudoknot, and CR4-5 domains, however, each structural domain plays a distinct role in telomere binding and telomerase activity reconstitution.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma controls autonomic regulation of the mouse
heart through Gi-independent downregulation of cAMP level.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):133-40.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cardiac beta-adrenergic and the muscarinic receptors control contractility and heart rate by triggering multiple signaling events involving downstream targets like the phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kgamma). We thus investigated whether the lack of PI3Kgamma could play a role in the autonomic regulation of the mouse heart. Contractility and ICaL of mutant cardiac preparations appeared increased in basal conditions and after beta-adrenergic stimulation. However, basal and beta-adrenergic stimulated heart rate were normal. Conversely, muscarinic inhibition of heart rate was reduced without alteration of the Gbetagamma-dependent stimulation of IK,ACh current. In addition, muscarinic-mediated anti-adrenergic effect on papillary muscle contractility and ICaL was significantly depressed. Consistently, cAMP level of PI3Kgamma-null ventricles was always higher than wild-type controls. Thus, PI3Kgamma controls the cardiac function by reducing cAMP concentration independently of Gi-mediated signaling.

IkB-alpha-specific transcript regulation by the C-terminal end of c-Rel.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):141-4.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The NF-kB family transcription factor c-Rel is a critical molecule for inducing expression of cytokine genes by T cells. Here, we report that a deletion of the C-terminal end, similar to the deletion in the highly oncogenic chicken v-Rel gene, renders c-Rel hyperactive toward cytokine gene promoters. At the same time, this mutation dramatically reduced c-Rel activity in induction of IkB-alpha mRNA expression. Moreover, ectopic expression of IkB-alpha, along with the C-terminal truncated c-Rel, abrogates hyperactivity of this mutant. IkB-alpha co-expression did not affect the function of wild-type c-Rel. The data demonstrate that the C-terminal end of c-Rel has specific activity for IkB-alpha mRNA expression and is dispensable for IL-2 gene expression.

Degradation of HER2/neu by apigenin induces apoptosis through cytochrome c

cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):145-52.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have shown that exposure of the HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells to apigenin resulted in induction of apoptosis by depleting HER2/neu protein and, in turn, suppressing the signaling of the HER2/HER3-PI3K/Akt pathway. Here, we examined whether inhibition of this pathway played a role in the anti-tumor effect. The results revealed that treatment with apigenin induced apoptosis through cytochrome c release and caused a rapid induction of caspase-3 activity and stimulated proteolytic cleavage of DFF-45. Furthermore, apigenin downregulated cyclin D1, D3 and Cdk4 and increased p27 protein levels. Colony formation in the soft agar assay, a hallmark of the transformation phenotype, was preferentially suppressed in HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells in the presence of apigenin. In addition, a structure-activity relationship study indicated that (1) the position of B ring; and (2) the existence of the 3', 4'-hydroxyl group on the 2-phenyl group were important for the depletion of HER2/neu protein by flavonoids. These results provided new insights into the structure-activity relationship of flavonoids.

Here, we report the construction and functional analysis of synthetic promoters designed for gene therapy applications requiring strong and specific gene expression in melanoma cell lines. We have analysed the transcriptional activity of different combinations of two transcriptional regulatory modules, a melanocyte-specific element from the human tyrosinase promoter and a cell-cycle-specific element from the human alpha-fetoprotein promoter. Transient expression assays in different cell lines show that several of these composite synthetic promoters can drive a strong and selective expression of a reporter gene in melanoma cell, providing us with a new powerful tool for gene therapy of melanomas.

<ABSTRACT>
RPA is an important component of DNA replication, repair and recombination, but its involvement in the signaling of cell-cycle checkpoints is not well understood. In this study, we show that knockdown of RPA1 by siRNA duplexes induces ATM (Ser1981) and Chk2 (Thr68), but not Chk1 (Ser345) phosphorylation and results in p21 upregulation in HeLa cells. However, the induction of Chk2 (Thr68) phosphorylation and p21 expression by RPA1 siRNA transfection can be completely blocked by the ATM inhibitor caffeine. Moreover, transfection of siRNAs targeting ATM dramatically reduces Chk2 (Thr68) phosphorylation in RPA1 knockdown cells. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of RPA1 activates the Chk2 signaling pathway in an ATM-dependent manner.

Human neutrophil alpha-defensin 4 inhibits HIV-1 infection in vitro.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):162-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Human neutrophil alpha-defensin 4 (HNP4) is more effective than HNP1-3 in protecting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from infection by both X4 and R5 HIV-1 strains. HNP4 binds to both CD4 and gp120 approximately two orders of magnitude weaker than does HNP1, and is less effectively sequestered by glycosylated serum proteins than HNP1. These results suggest that the HIV-1 inhibition by HNP4 stems at least partially from a unique and lectin-independent property of HNP4 with CD4 and/or gp120. Our finding identifies an anti-HIV-1 property of HNP4 and may have implications in the development of new antiviral agents for AIDS therapy.

A dioxin sensitive gene, mammalian WAPL, is implicated in spermatogenesis.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is an endocrine disruptor that produces a variety of toxic effects. We have isolated a mouse homolog of the hWAPL gene, termed mouse WAPL (mWAPL), as a target of TCDD by cDNA representational difference analysis from mouse embryonic stem cells. A statistically significant increase in mWAPL expression was observed at 0.1 microM TCDD in AhR-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Interestingly, at 1 microM TCDD, mWAPL mRNA levels decreased in AhR+/+ cells, but further increased in AhR-/- cells. hWAPL and mWAPL were highly expressed only in testes among normal tissue samples, and we observed mWAPL localization in the synaptonemal complex of testicular chromosomes. In addition, mouse testes decreased the expression of mWAPL mRNA after a single intraperitoneal injection of TCDD. Thus, mammalian WAPL such as hWAPL and mWAPL may be involved in spermatogenesis and be target genes mediating the reproductive toxicity induced by TCDD.

Gene silencing with STAT6 specific siRNAs blocks eotaxin release in
IL-4/TNFalpha stimulated human epithelial cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):173-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Small interfering RNAs have evolved as effective tools for the study of gene functions. Here, we demonstrate the use of different siRNAs for the specific knock down of the STAT6 transcription regulator and the complete silencing of the downstream signaling pathway. The knock down of STAT6 resulted in a complete loss of STAT6 specific DNA binding activity and blocked the release of eotaxin-3 in human epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) stimulated with IL-4 and TNFalpha with no signs of unspecific gene silencing. Other signaling pathways like the EGF stimulated release of IL-8 were still active in BEAS-2B cells treated with STAT6 specific siRNAs, demonstrating the specificity of these molecules.

Mia40, a novel factor for protein import into the intermembrane space of
mitochondria is able to bind metal ions.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):179-84.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Many proteins located in the intermembrane space (IMS) of mitochondria are characterized by a low molecular mass, contain highly conserved cysteine residues and coordinate metal ions. Studies on one of these proteins, Tim13, revealed that net translocation across the outer membrane is driven by metal-dependent folding in the IMS . We have identified an essential component, Mia40/Tim40/Ykl195w, with a highly conserved domain in the IMS that is able to bind zinc and copper ions. In cells lacking Mia40, the endogenous levels of Tim13 and other metal-binding IMS proteins are strongly reduced due to the impaired import of these proteins. Furthermore, Mia40 directly interacts with newly imported Tim13 protein. We conclude that Mia40 is the first essential component of a specific translocation pathway of metal-binding IMS proteins.

Differential effects of glucose deprivation on the cellular sensitivity
towards photodynamic treatment-based production of reactive oxygen species
and apoptosis-induction.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):185-90.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Photodynamic treatment (PDT) employs a photosensitizer and the light-induced formation of reactive oxygen species--antagonized by cellular antioxidant systems--for the removal of harmful cells. This study addresses the effect of altered carbohydrate metabolism on the cellular antioxidant glutathione system, and the subsequent responses to PDT. It is shown that glucose-deprivation of 18 h prior to PDT causes a reduced level of intracellular glutathione and an increased cytotoxicity of PDT. These effects can be mimicked by inhibitors of glutathione synthesis (buthionine-sulfoximine) or its regeneration (1,3-bis-(2-chlorethyl)-1-nitrosourea). Inhibited glutathione metabolism shifts the apoptotic window to lower fluences, while glucose deprivation abolishes apoptosis as a result of ATP deficiency. Our results prove evidence for manipulation of the outcome of PDT through internal metabolic pathways.

Cytokine mediated suppression of TF-1 apoptosis requires PI3K activation
and inhibition of Bim expression.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):191-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its effector protein kinase B (PKB/c-akt) have been implicated as critical mediators of cytokine-induced survival signals. In this study, we have utilized an IL-5 dependent hematopoietic cell line (TF-1) to investigate the signaling events involved in cytokine-dependent erythroblast survival. We demonstrate that IL-5 rescues TF-1 cells from apoptosis through a PI3K/PKB-dependent signaling pathway. Cytokine-withdrawal leads to activation of the Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a and subsequent expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim. Bim is itself sufficient to induce apoptosis in these cells. Importantly, activation of an inducible active FOXO3a mutant is alone sufficient for upregulation of Bim expression and induction of apoptosis. These data define a mechanism by which survival factors inhibit the default apoptotic pathway and can regulate TF-1 erythroblast survival.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Previously, we demonstrated the establishment of synthetic lethality screening in cultured somatic human cells, or mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), for chemicals or mutant genes synergistically lethal with a mutated gene of interest. Here, we show in MEFs that the usage of RNA interference-based genetic suppressor elements encoding short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) enables for genetic synthetic lethality screening at a frequency much higher than that achieved before with short truncated sense and antisense RNAs. These findings open up the possibility of using in mammalian cells genome-wide shRNA libraries for genetic synthetic lethality screening at the multi-gene level.

Hypotonic stress induces E-cadherin expression in cultured human
keratinocytes.

<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):207-14.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Human epidermis marks the interface between internal and external environments with the major task being to maintain body hydration. Alternating exposure of skin to a dry or humid environment is likely to cause changes in the epidermal water gradient resulting in osmotic alterations of epidermal keratinocytes. The present in vitro approach studied the effect of hypotonicity on cell-cell contact. It was demonstrated that hypotonic stress applied to human epithelial cells (HaCaT, A-431) induced upregulation of E-cadherin at both, the protein and mRNA level. 5'-deletional mutants of the E-cadherin promoter identified an element ranging from -53 to +31 that conveyed strong transactivation under hypotonic stress. In order to define relevant upstream regulators members of the MAP kinase family, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and protein kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt) were investigated. Hypotonic conditions led to a fast activation of ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK, p38, EGFR and PKB/Akt with distinct activation patterns. Experiments using specific inhibitors showed that p38 contributes to the E-cadherin transactivation under hypotonic conditions. Further upstream, adhesion was found to be a prerequisite for E-cadherin transactivation in this model. In summary, the present study provides evidence that E-cadherin is an osmo-sensitive gene that responds to hypotonic stress. The function of this regulation may be found in morphological changes induced by cell swelling. It is likely that induction of E-cadherin contributes to the stabilization between adjacent cells in order to withstand the physical forces induced by hypotonicity.

Crystal structure of the conserved hypothetical protein Rv1155 from
Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):215-21.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
With the aim of elucidating the biological function of hypothetical proteins unique amongst the Actynomyces sub-group of bacteria, we have solved the crystal structure of the conserved hypothetical protein Rv1155 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis at 1.8 A resolution. Rv1155 is a homodimer both in the crystal structure and in solution and folds into two separate domains consisting of a six-stranded anti-parallel beta-barrel fold flanked by two alpha-helices and a helix-turn-helix domain. Both domains contribute to the formation of two deep clefts at the dimer interface. The overall fold of Rv1155 strikingly resembles that of flavin mononucleotide-binding protein and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxydase, but the architecture of the putative binding pocket is markedly different, consistent with the lack of color of Rv1155 and its inability to bind FMN. Rv1155 thus appears to belong to a group of proteins with stringent conservation of the binding cleft, having evolved towards a new binding function.

<ABSTRACT>
Glucocorticoids act synergistically with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in increasing mRNA and protein levels of CYP1A1 in rat liver. The action of dexamethasone to modify CYP1A1 expression has been investigated in adult human hepatocytes. The effect of dexamethasone on the induction of CYP1A1 by 3-methylcholanthrene is different in rat and human liver cells. Dexamethasone potentiates the induction of CYP1A1 about 3- to 4-fold in rat cells. In human hepatocytes, it reduces CYP1A1 induction by 50-60% at enzyme protein level, while it does not have an effect on CYP1A1 mRNA amount.

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):236-40.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The MAP kinase pathway inhibitor U0126 caused phosphorylation and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and increased phosphorylation of its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase, in HEK293 cells. This effect only occurred in cells expressing the upstream kinase, LKB1. Of two other widely used MAP kinase pathway inhibitors not closely related in structure to U0126, PD98059 also activated AMPK but PD184352 did not. U0126 and PD98059, but not PD184352, also increased the cellular ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios, accounting for their ability to activate AMPK. These results suggest the need for caution in interpreting experiments conducted using U0126 and PD98059.

<ABSTRACT>
Tau exon 10 (E10) splicing is a crucial event in its developmental change of tau isoform and tauopathy. To investigate the splicing mechanism, we isolated and compared mouse tau genomic sequence with human sequence. We identified a new element in mouse intron 10 (I10) to suppress E10 splicing, which was located just after the stem-loop region previously proposed in human sequence and found to potentially form another stem-loop. Human I10 with a mutation (+29G to A) causing a decreased E10 splicing was also predicted to form similar double stem-loop, suggesting that this element is universally involved in regulation of E10 splicing.

system for human lipoprotein oxidation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):245-50.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We report for the first time that bovine or human CuZnSOD plus H2O2 can catalyze human lipoprotein oxidation, inducing like free copper ions a typical oxidative kinetics with lag and propagation phases. Free copper released from CuZnSOD by H2O2, but not enzyme peroxidase activity and carbonate radical anion, is responsible for lipoprotein oxidation, which is indeed totally inhibited by copper chelators and BHT but unaffected by bicarbonate. Moreover, lipoprotein oxidation is significantly counteracted by the OH* scavengers formate and azide, which can enter the active site of CuZnSOD and decrease copper release through scavenging of copper-bound OH*; benzoate and ethanol, which cannot enter, are instead ineffective, indicating no oxidative involvement of free OH* escaped from the enzyme active site. The possibility of CuZnSOD/H2O2-catalyzed lipoprotein oxidation in vivo is discussed.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau protein is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies; as yet the exact role of various tau kinases in this pathology is not fully understood. Here, we show that injection of isoproterenol, an activator of cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA), into rat hippocampus bilaterally results in the activation of PKA, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and cyclin-dependent kinase-5, inhibition of protein phosphatase-2A, hyperphosphorylation of tau at several Alzheimer-like epitopes and a disturbance of spatial memory retention 48 h after the drug injection. These findings suggest the involvement of PKA and PKA-mediated signaling pathway in the Alzheimer-like tau hyperphosphorylation and memory impairment.

Cannabinoid ligands are implicated in many physiological processes and to date two receptors have been identified. However, a growing body of evidence exists that suggests the presence of additional receptors. Whilst cloning the previously described hCB1a, we have identified a novel variant that we call hCB1b. Characterising these two splice variants demonstrates that they have a unique pharmacological profile and that their RNA's are expressed at low levels in a variety of tissues.

<ABSTRACT>
Rana catesbeiana ribonuclease (RC-RNase) possesses tumor-specific cytotoxicity, which can be synergized by IFN-gamma. However, it is unclear how RC-RNase and RC-RNase/IFN-gamma induce cell death. In this study, we use substrate cleavage assays to systematically investigate RC-RNase- and RC-RNase/IFN-gamma-induced caspase activation in HL-60, MCF-7, and SK-Hep-1 cells. We find that RC-RNase and RC-RNase/IFN-gamma induce mitochondria-mediated caspase activation in HL-60 and MCF-7 cells but not in SK-Hep-1 cells, although death of SK-Hep-1 cells is closely related to mitochondrial disruptions. Our findings provide evidence that RC-RNase and RC-RNase/IFN-gamma can kill different cancer cells by distinct mechanisms. Compared with onconase, RC-RNase seems to harbor a more specific anti-cancer activity.

<ABSTRACT>
This study explores how the kinetics of a coupled folding/binding reaction depend on the initial conformation of the protein. Stopped-flow spectroscopy is used to monitor the reaction of apo-myoglobin (aMb) with hemin dicyanide at pH 7.2. Different initial aMb conformations are tested. In the case of acid-denatured aMb, the observed kinetics are consistent with a "fly-casting" scenario [Shoemaker et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97 (2000) 8868-8873]. However, the formation of a compact complex proceeds more rapidly in the case of prefolded aMb. This finding is opposite to what would be expected based on predictions of the fly-casting model.

<ABSTRACT>
Cyanobacteria have previously been considered to differ fundamentally from plants and algae in their regulation of light harvesting. We show here that in fact the ecologically important marine prochlorophyte, Prochlorococcus, is capable of forming rapidly reversible non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll a fluorescence (NPQf or qE) as are freshwater cyanobacteria when they employ the iron stress induced chlorophyll-based antenna, IsiA. For Prochlorococcus, the capacity for NPQf is greater in high light-adapted strains, except during iron starvation which allows for increased quenching in low light-adapted strains. NPQf formation in freshwater cyanobacteria is accompanied by deep Fo quenching which increases with prolonged iron starvation.

<ABSTRACT>
Although vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are widely used in cardiovascular research, their phenotypic change under various culture conditions is problematic to evaluate the experimental results obtained. The levels of angiotensin (Ang) type 1/2 (AT1/AT2) receptors as well as contractile and structural proteins are degraded through culture passages. The present study demonstrated that heparin recovered Ang receptors and differentiation markers, such as desmin, SM-22 and smooth muscle alpha-actin in VSMCs at the ninth passage. Heparin also potenciated Ang II-induced activation for ERK1/2 and p38. These results suggest a potential value of heparin-treated VSMCs as the model for analysis of Ang-mediated signal transduction under physiological condition.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 3;579(1):285-91.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have investigated the effect of the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent, methyl thiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA), on ligand binding to the human melanocortin-4 (MC4) receptor stably expressed in HEK-293 cells. MTSEA inhibited binding of the agonist, 125I-NDPalpha-MSH, and the antagonist, 125I-SHU9119, in a concentration-dependent manner. Pre-incubation of cells with either the agonist or antagonist protected from subsequent MTSEA inhibition of radioligand binding. Mutation of Cys130 in transmembrane helix 3 to alanine, whilst not affecting ligand binding, led to a complete loss of the inhibitory effect of MTSEA. Since other types of sulfhydryl-reactive reagents had no effect on ligand binding, we conclude that covalent modification of Cys130 by MTSEA disrupts ligand binding by neutralising a close-by negative charge, most likely on Asp126.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
This study describes the first promising steps in the comparison of peptide patterns of laser capture microdissected trophoblast cells obtained from frozen tissue sections in relative low numbers, approximately 125 cells. Trophoblasts were collected by laser capture microdissection from a terme human placenta and dissolved in detergents, sonified, and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptide mixtures were directly analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry. Using this approach specific peptide patterns that consist on average of approximately 35 peptide peaks for trophoblast cells, and surrounding villous stroma cells could be obtained. From the results it was concluded that trophoblast and surrounding villous stroma cells show exclusive discriminating peptide patterns. In the future this method is potentially suitable for finding specific peptides and identification of proteins that are related to the pathogenesis of trophoblast pregnancy diseases such as preeclampsia.

<ABSTRACT>
Forestry is a valuable natural resource for many countries. Rapid production of large quantities of genetically improved and uniform seedlings for restocking harvested lands is a key component of sustainable forest management programs. Clonal propagation through somatic embryogenesis has the potential to meet this need in conifers and can offer the added benefit of ensuring consistent seedling quality. Although in commercial use, mass production of conifers through somatic embryogenesis is relatively new and there are numerous biological unknowns regarding this complex developmental pathway. To aid in unravelling the embryo developmental process, two-dimensional electrophoresis was employed to quantitatively assess the expression levels of proteins across four stages of somatic embryo maturation in white spruce (0, 7, 21 and 35 days post abscisic acid treatment). Forty-eight differentially expressed proteins have been identified, which display a significant change in abundance as early as day 7 of embryo development. These proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, many of which have not previously been associated with embryo development. The identification of these proteins was greatly assisted by the availability of a substantial expressed sequence tag (EST) resource developed for white, sitka and interior spruce. The combined use of these spruce ESTs in conjunction with GenBank accessions for other plants improved the rate of protein identification from 38% to 62% when compared with GenBank alone using automated, high-throughput techniques. This underscores the utility of EST resources in a proteomic study of any species for which a genome sequence is unavailable.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) play a crucial role in cardiovascular disorders. A differential proteomic approach should help to elucidate SMC dysfunctions involved in these diseases. With this goal in mind, we plotted the first 2-dimensional (2-D) maps of the proteome and secretome of human arterial smooth muscle cell (ASMC). Intracellular and secreted proteins were extracted from a primary culture of SMCs obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (n = 11) and separated by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Silver-stained gels were analyzed using Progenesis software. A high level of between-gel reproducibility was obtained, allowing us to generate two protein patterns specific to the ASMC proteome and secretome, respectively. A total of 121 and 40 distinct intracellular and secreted polypeptide spots, corresponding to 83 and 18 different proteins, respectively, were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. The 2-D reference maps and database resulting from this study confirm that SMCs are involved in a wide range of biological functions. They could constitute a useful tool for a wide range of investigators involved in vascular biology, allowing them to investigate SMC protein changes associated with cardiovascular disorders or environmental stimuli.

<ABSTRACT>
Quantitative structure retention relationships (QSRR) were derived allowing prediction of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) retention of peptides. To quantitatively characterize the structure of a peptide, and then to predict its gradient retention time under given HPLC conditions, the following descriptors are employed: logarithm of the sum of retention times of the amino acids composing the peptide, log Sum(AA), logarithm of Van der Waals volume of the peptide, log VDW(Vol), and logarithm of its calculated n-octanol-water partition coefficient, clog P. The first descriptor is based on a set of empirical data for 20 natural amino acids. The next two descriptors are easily calculated from a structural formula. The predicted gradient retention times are in excellent agreement with the experimental data, determined for a structurally diversified series of 101 peptides. The QSRR equation obtained predicts in a convenient and reliable manner the retention times for any peptide in a once characterized HPLC system.

Proteome dynamics in complex organisms: using stable isotopes to monitor
individual protein turnover rates.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(2):522-33.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The complete definition of changes in a proteome requires information about dynamics and specifically the rate at which the individual proteins are turned over intracellularly. Whilst this can be achieved in single-cell culture using stable isotope precursors, it is more challenging to develop methods for intact animals. In this study, we show how dietary administration of stable isotope-labelled amino acids can obtain information on the relative rates of synthesis and degradation of individual proteins in a proteome. The pattern of stable isotope-labelling in tryptic peptides can be deconstructed to yield a highly reliable measure of the isotope abundance of the precursor pool, a parameter that is often difficult to acquire. We demonstrate this approach using chickens fed a semisynthetic diet containing [(2)H(8)]valine at a calculated relative isotope abundance (RIA) of 0.5. When the labelling pattern of gel-resolved muscle proteins was analyzed, the intracellular precursor isotope abundance was 0.35, consistent with dilution of the amino acid precursor pool with unlabelled amino acids derived from degradation of pre-existing proteins. However, the RIA was stable over an extended labelling window, and permitted calculation of the rates of synthesis and degradation of individual proteins isolated by gel electrophoresis. For the first time, it is feasible to contemplate the analysis of turnover of individual proteins in intact animals.

Peeling the yeast protein network.

<ABSTRACT>
A set of highly connected proteins (or hubs) plays an important role for the integrity of the protein interaction network of Saccharomyces cerevisae by connecting the network's intrinsic modules. The importance of the hubs' central placement is further confirmed by their propensity to be lethal. However, although highly emphasized, little is known about the topological coherence among the hubs. Applying a core decomposition method which allows us to identify the inherent layer structure of the protein interaction network, we find that the probability of nodes both being essential and evolutionary conserved successively increases toward the innermost cores. While connectivity alone is often not a sufficient criterion to assess a protein's functional, evolutionary and topological relevance, we classify nodes as globally and locally central depending on their appearance in the inner or outer cores. The observation that globally central proteins participate in a substantial number of protein complexes which display an elevated degree of evolutionary conservation allows us to hypothesize that globally central proteins serve as the evolutionary backbone of the proteome. Even though protein interaction data are extensively flawed, we find that our results are very robust against inaccurately determined protein interactions.

Multigenic families and proteomics: extended protein characterization as a
tool for paralog gene identification.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(2):450-60.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In classical proteomic studies, the searches in protein databases lead mostly to the identification of protein functions by homology due to the non-exhaustiveness of the protein databases. The quality of the identification depends on the studied organism, its complexity and its representation in the protein databases. Nevertheless, this basic function identification is insufficient for certain applications namely for the development of RNA-based gene-silencing strategies, commonly termed RNA interference (RNAi) in animals and post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants, that require an unambiguous identification of the targeted gene sequence. A PTGS strategy was considered in the study of the infection of Oryza sativa by the Rice Yellow Mottle Virus (RYMV). It is suspected that the RYMV recruits host proteins after its entry into plant cells to form a complex facilitating virus multiplication and spreading. The protein partners of this complex were identified by a classical proteomic approach, nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Among the identified proteins, several were retained for a PTGS strategy. Nevertheless most of the protein candidates appear to be members of multigenic families for which all paralog genes are not present in protein databases. Thus the identification of the real expressed paralog gene with classical protein database searches is impossible. Consequently, as the genome contains all genes and thus all paralog genes, a whole genome search strategy was developed to determine the specific expressed paralog gene. With this approach, the identification of peptides matching only a single gene, called discriminant peptides, allows definitive proof of the expression of this identified gene. This strategy has several requirements: (i) a genome completely sequenced and accessible; (ii) high protein sequence coverage. In the present work, through three examples, we report and validate for the first time a genome database search strategy to specifically identify paralog genes belonging to multigenic families expressed under specific conditions.

Liquid ultraviolet matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization -- mass
spectrometry for automated proteomic analysis.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(2):360-70.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have combined several key sample preparation steps for the use of a liquid matrix system to provide high analytical sensitivity in automated ultraviolet -- matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation -- mass spectrometry (UV-MALDI-MS). This new sample preparation protocol employs a matrix-mixture which is based on the glycerol matrix-mixture described by Sze et al. The low-femtomole sensitivity that is achievable with this new preparation protocol enables proteomic analysis of protein digests comparable to solid-state matrix systems. For automated data acquisition and analysis, the MALDI performance of this liquid matrix surpasses the conventional solid-state MALDI matrices. Besides the inherent general advantages of liquid samples for automated sample preparation and data acquisition the use of the presented liquid matrix significantly reduces the extent of unspecific ion signals in peptide mass fingerprints compared to typically used solid matrices, such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) or alpha-cyano-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA). In particular, matrix and low-mass ion signals and ion signals resulting from cation adduct formation are dramatically reduced. Consequently, the confidence level of protein identification by peptide mass mapping of in-solution and in-gel digests is generally higher.

Analysis of thyroglobulin iodination by tandem mass spectrometry using
immonium ions of monoiodo- and diiodo-tyrosine.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(2):351-3.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Peptides containing a monoiodo- or diiodo-tyrosine residue (monoiodo-Y, diiodo-Y) were found to generate abundant immonium ions following collision-induced dissociation at m/z 261.97 and 387.87 Da, respectively. These residue-specific marker ions are between about 140 mDa (monoiodo-Y) and 300 mDa (diiodo-Y) mass deficient relative to any other peptide fragment ions of unmodified peptides, qualifying them as highly specific marker ions for tyrosine iodination when analyzed by high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Two new iodination sites (Y-364 and Y-2165) were pinpointed in bovine thyroglobulin by MS/MS using these iodotyrosine-specific marker ions and combined tryptic/chymotryptic digestion.

<ABSTRACT>
Proteins of haloarchaea are remarkably unstable in low-ionic-strength solvents and tend to aggregate under standard two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis conditions, causing strong horizontal streaking. We have developed a new approach to generate 2-D maps of halophilic proteins which included washing cells with 1.5 M Tris-HCl buffer. In addition, proteins were precipitated with acetone, solubilized with urea and thiourea in the presence of the sulfobetaine detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamino]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), reduced with tributylphosphine (TBP), and separated with microrange strips of immobilized pH gradients (pH 3.9-5.1). This combination enabled the construction of highly reproducible 2-D maps of Haloferax volcanii proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
We compare the catalytic activities of enzymes immobilized on silicon surfaces with and without orientation. While oriented sulfotransferases selectively immobilized on an otherwise zero-background surface via 6xHis tags faithfully reflect activities of solution phase enzymes, those with random orientation on the surface do not. This finding demonstrates that controlling the orientation of immobilized protein molecules and designing an ideal local chemical environment on the solid surface are both essential if protein microarrays are to be used as quantitative tools in biomedical research.

Housekeeping proteins: a preliminary study illustrating some limitations

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(2):566-71.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A primary objective of many protein expression studies is to define expression patterns that can distinguish between normal and diseased states, enabling a better understanding of molecular events associated with disease development and progression and ultimately potentially finding novel markers or therapeutic targets. Exploration and confirmation of many proteins is often done using Western blotting with normalization against "housekeeping proteins", such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta-actin, or beta-tubulin, to correct for protein loading and factors, such as transfer efficiency. Increasingly, in studies examining gene transcript levels, it has been shown that some of the commonly used housekeeping genes may be unsuitable due to the influence of various physiological and pathological factors on their expression. This has not been examined to any great extent for proteins, however. This study examines the degree of variability of three commonly used "housekeeping" proteins (GAPDH, beta-actin, and beta-tubulin) together with class I beta-tubulin, with comparisons being made between a number of different established renal cancer cell lines, matched pairs of renal tumor and normal kidney lysates as well as nine different human tissues and highlights some of the problems encountered.

<ABSTRACT>
There is significant interest in characterization of the human plasma proteome due to its potential for providing biomarkers applicable to clinical diagnosis and treatment and for gaining a better understanding of human diseases. We describe here a strategy for comparative proteome analyses of human plasma, which is applicable to biomarker identifications for various disease states. Multidimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been applied to make comparative proteome analyses of plasma samples from an individual prior to and 9 h after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Peptide peak areas and the number of peptide identifications for each protein were used to evaluate the reproducibility of LC-MS/MS and to compare relative changes in protein concentration between the samples following LPS treatment. A total of 804 distinct plasma proteins (not including immunoglobulins) were confidently identified with 32 proteins observed to be significantly increased in concentration following LPS administration, including several known inflammatory response or acute-phase mediators such as C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A and A2, LPS-binding protein, LPS-responsive and beige-like anchor protein, hepatocyte growth factor activator, and von Willebrand factor, and thus, constituting potential biomarkers for inflammatory response.

Analysis of the Listeria cell wall proteome by two-dimensional nanoliquid
chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(2):433-43.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Genome analyses have revealed that the Gram-positive bacterial species Listeria monocytogenes and L. innocua contain a large number of genes encoding surface proteins predicted to be covalently bound to the cell wall (41 and 34, respectively). The function of most of these proteins is unknown and they have not even been identified biochemically. Here, we report the first characterization of the Listeria cell wall proteome using a nonelectrophoretic approach. The material analyzed consisted of a peptide mixture obtained from a cell wall extract insoluble in boiling 4% SDS. This extract, containing peptidoglycan (intrinsically resistant to proteases) and strongly associated proteins, was digested with trypsin in a solution with 0.01% SDS, used to favor protein digestion throughout the peptidoglycan. The resulting complex peptide mixture was fractionated and analyzed by two-dimensional nanoliquid chromatography coupled to ion-trap mass spectrometry. A total of 30 protein species were unequivocally identified in cell wall extracts of the genome strains L. monocytogenes EGD-e (19 proteins) and L. innocua CLIP11262 (11 proteins). Among them, 20 proteins bearing an LPXTG motif recognized for covalent anchoring to the peptidoglycan were identified. Other proteins detected included peptidoglycan-lytic enzymes, a penicillin-binding protein, and proteins bearing an NXZTN motif recently proposed to direct protein anchoring to the peptidoglycan. The marked sensitivity of the method makes it highly attractive in the post-genome era for defining the cell wall proteome in any bacterial species. This information will be useful to study novel protein-peptidoglycan associations and to rapidly identify new targets in the surface of important bacterial pathogens.

<ABSTRACT>
The molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the risk of atherosclerosis are not clear. Therefore, detailed information about the protein composition of LDL may contribute to reveal its role in atherogenesis and the mechanisms that lead to coronary disease in humans. Here, we sought to map the proteins in human LDL by a proteomic approach. LDL was isolated by two-step discontinuous density-gradient ultracentrifugation and the proteins were separated with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified with peptide mass fingerprinting, using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry and with amino acid sequencing using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. These procedures identified apo B-100, apo C-II, apo C-III (three isoforms), apo E (four isoforms), apo A-I (two isoforms), apo A-IV, apo J and apo M (three isoforms not previously described). In addition, three proteins that have not previously been identified in LDL were found: serum amyloid A-IV (two isoforms), calgranulin A, and lysozyme C. The identities of apo M, calgranulin A, and lysozyme C were confirmed by sequence information obtained after collision-induced dissociation fragmentation of peptides characteristic for these proteins. Moreover, the presence of lysozyme C was further corroborated by demonstrating enriched hydrolytic activity in LDL against Micrococcus lysodeikticus. These results indicate that in addition to the dominating apo B-100, LDL contains a number of other apolipoproteins, many of which occur in different isoforms. The demonstration, for the first time, that LDL contains calgranulin A and lysozyme C raises the possibility that LDL proteins may play hitherto unknown role(s) in immune and inflammatory reactions of the arterial wall.

Proteomics analysis of prefractionated human lumbar cerebrospinal fluid.

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(2):541-50.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced by the chorioid plexus in the ventricles. It surrounds the brain and bone marrow, and reflects several different disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). Proteomics has been used to analyze CSF in order to discover disease-associated proteins and to elucidate the basic molecular mechanisms that either cause, or result from, CNS disorders. However, some disease-associated proteins are of low-abundance and are difficult to detect. A low total-protein concentration, a high amount of albumin and immunoglobins, and a wide dynamic range (several orders of magnitude) of protein concentration cause several difficulties in the identification of low-abundance CSF proteins. In this study, advantage was taken of the range of different hydrophobic properties of CSF proteins, and a reversed-phase solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge was used to prefractionate human lumbar CSF proteins into three separate fractions prior to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis resolution of the proteome. A portion of the high-abundance CSF proteins were removed from two (eluted with 35% and 50% acetonitrile) of the three fractions. Some trace CSF proteins were preferentially enriched in the two fractions, and many proteins were detected in the two-dimensional (2-D) gels of the two fractions. Among the novel proteins identified, sixty-two protein spots that represent forty-two proteins were characterized. Most of the proteins have not been annotated in any previous 2-D map of human CSF, and several have been implicated in CNS diseases. The prefractionation of CSF proteins with SPE, followed by proteomics analysis, provides a new method to explore low-abundance, disease-specific CSF proteins.

Proteomic analysis of bovine skeletal muscle hypertrophy.

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(2):490-500.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Myostatin plays a major role in muscle growth and development and animals with disruption of this gene display marked increases in muscle mass. Little is known about muscle physiological adaptations in relation to this muscle hypertrophy. To provide a more comprehensive view, we analyzed bovine muscles from control, heterozygote and homozygote young Belgian blue bulls for myostatin deletion, which results in a normal level of inactive myostatin. Heterozygote and homozygote animals were characterized by a higher proportion of fast-twitch glycolytic fibers in Semitendinosus muscle. Differential proteomic analysis of this muscle was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry. Thirteen proteins, corresponding to 28 protein spots, were significantly altered in response to the myostatin deletion. The observed changes in protein expression are consistent with an increased fast muscle phenotype, suggesting that myostatin negatively controls mainly fast-twitch glycolytic fiber number. Finally, we demonstrated that differential mRNA splicing of fast troponin T is altered by the loss of myostatin function. The structure of mutually exclusive exon 16 appears predominantly expressed in muscles from heterozygote and homozygote animals. This suggests a role for exon 16 of fast troponin T in the physiological adaptation of the fast muscle phenotype.

A multifaceted analysis of viperid snake venoms by two-dimensional gel

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(2):501-10.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The complexity of Viperid venoms has long been appreciated by investigators in the fields of toxinology and medicine. However, it is only recently that the depth of that complexity has become somewhat quantitatively and qualitatively appreciated. With the resurgence of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and the advances in mass spectrometry virtually all venom components can be visualized and identified given sufficient effort and resources. Here we present the use of 2-DE for examining venom complexity as well as demonstrating interesting approaches to selectively delineate subpopulations of venom proteins based on particular characteristics of the proteins such as antibody cross-reactivity or enzymatic activities. 2-DE comparisons between venoms from different species of the same genus (Bothrops) of snake clearly demonstrated both the similarity as well as the apparent diversity among these venoms. Using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry we were able to identify regions of the two-dimensional gels from each venom in which certain classes of proteins were found. 2-DE was also used to compare venoms from Crotalus atrox and Bothrops jararaca. For these venoms a variety of staining/detection protocols was utilized to compare and contrast the venoms. Specifically, we used various stains to visualize subpopulations of the venom proteomes of these snakes, including Coomassie, Silver, Sypro Ruby and Pro-Q-Emerald. Using specific antibodies in Western blot analyses of 2-DE of the venoms we have examined subpopulations of proteins in these venoms including the serine proteinase proteome, the metalloproteinase proteome, and the phospholipases A2 proteome. A functional assessment of the gelatinolytic activity of these venoms was also performed by zymography. These approaches have given rise to a more thorough understanding of venom complexity and the toxins comprising these venoms and provide insights to investigators who wish to focus on these venom subpopulations of proteins in future studies.

<ABSTRACT>
Oxidative stress and free radical production have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, where low levels of the antioxidant vitamin C (ascorbate) have been shown to be associated with the disease. In this study, neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ascorbate in order to elucidate the mechanism(s) of protection against oxidative stress afforded by ascorbate. Protein oxidation, glutathione levels, cell viability and the effects on the proteome and its oxidized counterpart were monitored. SH-SY5Y cells treated with ascorbate prior to co-incubation with peroxide showed increased viability in comparison to cells treated with peroxide alone. This dual treatment also caused an increase in protein carbonyl content and a decrease in glutathione levels within the cells. Proteins, extracted from SH-SY5Y cells that were treated with either ascorbate or peroxide alone or with ascorbate prior to peroxide, were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analyzed for oxidation. Co-incubation for 24 hours decreased the number of oxidised proteins (e.g. acyl CoA oxidase 3) and induced brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Enhanced expression of BDNF may contribute to the protective effects of ascorbate against oxidative stress in neuronal cells.

<ABSTRACT>
The technique of proteome analysis using 2-DE has the power to monitor global changes that occur in the protein complement of tissues and subcellular compartments. In this review, we describe construction of the rice proteome database, the cataloging of rice proteins, and the functional characterization of some of the proteins identified. Initially, proteins extracted from various tissues and organelles were separated by 2-DE and an image analyzer was used to construct a display or reference map of the proteins. The rice proteome database currently contains 23 reference maps based on 2-DE of proteins from different rice tissues and subcellular compartments. These reference maps comprise 13 129 rice proteins, and the amino acid sequences of 5092 of these proteins are entered in the database. Major proteins involved in growth or stress responses have been identified by using a proteomics approach and some of these proteins have unique functions. Furthermore, initial work has also begun on analyzing the phosphoproteome and protein-protein interactions in rice. The information obtained from the rice proteome database will aid in the molecular cloning of rice genes and in predicting the function of unknown proteins.

Leptin, from fat to inflammation: old questions and new insights.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):295-301.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Leptin is 16 kDa adipokine that links nutritional status with neuroendocrine and immune functions. Initially thought to be a satiety factor that regulates body weight by inhibiting food intake and stimulating energy expenditure, leptin is a pleiotropic hormone whose multiple effects include regulation of endocrine function, reproduction, and immunity. Leptin can be considered as a pro-inflammatory cytokine that belongs to the family of long-chain helical cytokines and has structural similarity with interleukin-6, prolactin, growth hormone, IL-12, IL-15, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and oncostatin M. Because of its dual nature as a hormone and cytokine, leptin links the neuroendocrine and the immune system. The role of leptin in the modulation of immune response and inflammation has recently become increasingly evident. The increase in leptin production that occurs during infection and inflammation strongly suggests that leptin is a part of the cytokine network which governs the inflammatory-immune response and the host defense mechanisms. Leptin plays an important role in inflammatory processes involving T cells and has been reported to modulate T-helper cells activity in the cellular immune response. Several studies have implicated leptin in the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammatory conditions, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and intestinal inflammation. Very recently, a key role for leptin in osteoarthritis has been demonstrated: leptin indeed exhibits, in concert with other pro-inflammatory cytokines, a detrimental effect on articular cartilage by promoting nitric oxide synthesis in chondrocytes. Here, we review the recent advances regarding leptin biology with a special focus on those actions relevant to the role of leptin in the pathophysiology of inflammatory processes and immune responses.

<ABSTRACT>
An in silico survey of all known 3D-structures of glycoside hydrolases that contain a ligand in the -1 subsite is presented. A recurrent crucial positioning of active site residues indicates a common general strategy for electrostatic stabilisation directed to the carbohydrate's ring-oxygen at the transition state. This is substantially different depending on whether the enzyme's proton donor is syn or anti positioned versus the substrate. A comprehensive list of enzymes belonging to 42 different families is given and selected examples are described. An implication for an early evolution scenario of glycoside hydrolases is discussed.

Evolution of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins: novel invertebrate UCP
homologues suggest early evolutionary divergence of the UCP family.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):313-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Current hypothesis about the evolution of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) proposed by suggests that UCP4 is the earliest form of UCP ancestral to all other UCP orthologues. However, this hypothesis is difficult to reconcile with a narrow tissue distribution of UCP4 (which is a brain-specific isoform), suggesting highly specialized rather than anfcestral function for this protein. We searched for UCP2, UCP3, and UCP5 homologues in invertebrate genomes using amplification with degenerate primers designed against UCP2-specific conserved sequences and/or BLASTP search with stringent ad hoc criteria to distinguish between homologues and orthologues of different UCPs. Our study identified invertebrate UCP homologues similar to UCP2 and 3 (which we termed UCP6) and an invertebrate homologue of UCP5. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that there are at least three clades of UCPs in invertebrates, which are closely related to vertebrate UCP1-3, UCP4, and UCP5, respectively, and shows early evolutionary divergence of UCPs, which pre-dates the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes. It also suggests that the newly identified UCP6 proteins from invertebrates are ancestral to the vertebrate UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3, and that divergence of these three vertebrate orthologues occurred late in evolution of the vertebrates. This study refutes the hypothesis of Hanak and Jezek (2001) that UCP4 is an ancestral form for all UCPs, and shows early evolutionary diversification of this protein family, which corresponds to their proposed functional diversity in regulation of proton leak, antioxidant defense and apoptosis.

Stage-specific expression of microRNAs during Xenopus development.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):318-24.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) repress target genes at the post-transcriptional level and play important roles in development and cell lineage decision. However, in vertebrates, both the targets of miRNAs and their expression profile during development are poorly understood. Here, we report the detailed expression profiles of miRNAs from oocyte stage to tadpole stage in Xenopus laevis. As development proceeds, a variety of miRNAs start to be expressed. Most miRNAs emerged at a specific stage and were continuously expressed until the tadpole stage. In addition, we identified a novel miRNA that was expressed only at specific stages of development and that is likely to have roles in midblastula transition.

One- and two-photon photoactivation of a paGFP-fusion protein in live
Drosophila embryos.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):325-30.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We constructed a photoactivatable Drosophila histone 2 A variant green fluorescent fusion protein (H2AvD-paGFP) for tracking chromatin loci in living Drosophila embryos. Activation of paGFP was achieved by irradiation from a single-photon diode laser at 408 nm, but activated nuclei failed to divide. Photoconversion could also be achieved by two-photon fs pulses in the range of 780-840 nm. Viability in whole-mount embryos could only be maintained at 820 nm, at which we could activate, simultaneously track and quantitate the mobility of multiple fluorescent loci. This report constitutes the first demonstration of two-photon activation of paGFP and the use of a paGFP-fusion protein in investigations of whole organisms.

Constitutive activity of Sauromatum guttatum alternative oxidase in

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Activity of the plant mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) can be regulated by organic acids, notably pyruvate. To date, only two well-conserved cysteine residues have been implicated in this process. We report the functional expression of two AOX isozymes (Sauromatum guttatum Sg-AOX and Arabidopsis thaliana At-AOX1a) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Comparison of the response of these two isozymes to pyruvate in isolated yeast mitochondria and disrupted mitochondrial membranes reveals that in contrast to At-AOX1a, Sg-AOX activity is insensitive to pyruvate and appears to be in a constitutively active state. As both of these isozymes conserve the two cysteines, we propose that such contrasting behaviour must be a direct result of differences in their amino acid sequence and have subsequently identified novel candidate residues.

AtNTRB is the major mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase in Arabidopsis

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):337-42.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductases (NTR) are homodimeric enzymes that reduce thioredoxins. Two genes encoding NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductases (AtNTRA and AtNTRB) were found in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. These originated from a recent duplication event and the encoded proteins are highly homologous. Previously, AtNTRA was shown to encode a dual targeted cytosol and mitochondrial protein. Here, we show that the AtNTRB gene encodes two mRNAs, presumably by initiating transcription at two different sites. The longer mRNA encodes a precursor polypeptide that is actively imported into mitochondria by a cleavage-associated mechanism, while the shorter mRNA encodes a cytosolic isoform. Isolation of Arabidopsis mutants with knocked-out AtNTRA or AtNTRB genes allowed us to prove that both genes encode cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms. Interestingly, AtNTRB appeared to express the major mitochondrial NTR, while AtNTRA expresses as the major cytosolic isoform, suggesting that these two recently duplicated genes are evolving towards a specific function.

Requirement of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate for HERC1-mediated
guanine nucleotide release from ARF proteins.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):343-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
HERC1 is a giant multidomain protein involved in membrane trafficking through its interaction with vesicle coat proteins such as clathrin and ARF. Previously, it has been shown that the RCC1-like domain 1 (RLD1) of HERC1 stimulates guanine nucleotide dissociation on ARF1 and Rab proteins. In this study, we have analyzed whether HERC1 may also regulate ARF6 activity. We show that HERC1, through its RLD1, stimulates GDP release from ARF6 but, unexpectedly, it inhibits GDP/GTP exchange on ARF6 under conditions where ARNO stimulates it. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the activity of HERC1 as a guanine nucleotide release factor requires the presence of PI(4,5)P(2) bound to HERC1's RLD1. In agreement with this, we find that purified HERC1 contains PI(4,5)P(2) bound to the RLD1.

A Gly/Ala switch contributes to high affinity binding of
benzoxazinone-based non-peptide oxytocin receptor antagonists.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):349-56.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Non-peptide antagonists of the oxytocin receptor (OTR) have been developed to prevent pre-term labour. The benzoxazinone-based antagonists L-371,257 and L-372,662 display pronounced species-dependent pharmacology with respect to selectivity for the OTR over the V(1a) vasopressin receptor. Examination of receptor sequences from different species identified Ala(318) in helix 7 of the human OTR as a candidate discriminator required for high affinity binding. The mutant receptor [A318G]OTR was engineered and characterised using ligands representing many different chemical classes. Of all the ligands investigated, only the benzoxazinone-based antagonists had decreased affinity for [A318G]OTR. Molecular modelling revealed that Ala(318) provides a direct hydrophobic contact with a methoxy group of L-371,257 and L-372,662.

Specific expression of pfkfb4 gene in spermatogonia germ cells and

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):357-62.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The results presented demonstrate the expression of pfkfb4 gene in adult testis and in a mouse spermatogonia germ cell line (GC-1spg). The genomic organization of the human pfkfb4 gene shows the existence of 14 exons and 13 introns, spanning 45 kb. A detailed analysis of the 5'-flanking region by transient transfection assays with different 5'-deletion promoter constructs in GC-1spg and mouse sertoli cells (TM-4), allows us to define the minimal promoter unit, containing several GC-rich and ETF sequences along the first -141 nucleotides involved in basal expression. This gene is activated by serum and chemical hypoxia (CoCl(2) treatment) whereas beta-estradiol decreases its expression.

<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):363-72.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Protein phosphatase (PP)-2A, which regulates the phosphorylation of tau, is regulated by two endogenous inhibitor proteins, I(1)(PP2A) and I(2)(PP2A), in mammalian tissues. Here, we report the cloning of I(1)(PP2A) and I(2)(PP2A) from human brain, and show that in PC12 cells and in I(1)(PP2A)-GFP or I(2)(PP2A)-GFP transfected NIH3T3 and human neural progenitor cells, I(1)(PP2A) is localized mostly in the cell cytoplasm and I(2)(PP2A) mostly in the nucleus. The recombinant I(1)(PP-2A) and I(2)(PP-2A) inhibit PP-2A activity towards hyperphosphorylated tau in vitro; the dephosphorylation of the hyperphosphorylated tau at specific sites is selectively inhibited. Overexpression of I(1)(PP2A) as well as I(2)(PP2A) results in tau hyperphosphorylation and degeneration of PC 12 cells.

antiporters.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):373-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The diuretic drug amiloride and its numerous derivatives are competitive inhibitors of mammalian Na(+)/H(+) antiporters and other eukaryotic antiporters. Most prokaryotic antiporters, including the major NhaA family of enterobacteria, are resistant to these compounds. We show that 2-aminoperimidine (AP), a guanidine-containing naphthalene derivative with some similarity to amiloride, acts as a specific inhibitor of NhaA from Escherichia coli. Similar concentrations (IC(50) of 0.9 muM) inhibit the proton motive force dependent Na(+)(Li(+))/H(+) exchange reaction in inside-out sub-bacterial vesicles (at 10 mM NaCl, pH 8) as well as the initial rate of (22)Na(+)/Na(+) exchange mediated by pure NhaA in proteoliposomes. The inhibitor is specific to NhaA type antiporters, so AP is a new tool to study the mechanism and roles of NhaA antiporters of enterobacteria as well as the molecular basis of inhibition by an amiloride-like compound.

Expression and subcellular targeting of canine parvovirus capsid proteins
in baculovirus-transduced NLFK cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):385-92.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A mammalian baculovirus delivery system was developed to study targeting in Norden Laboratories feline kidney (NLFK) cells of the capsid proteins of canine parvovirus (CPV), VP1 and VP2, or corresponding counterparts fused to EGFP. VP1 and VP2, when expressed alone, both had equal nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution. However, assembled form of VP2 had a predominantly cytoplasmic localization. When VP1 and VP2 were simultaneously present in cells, their nuclear localization increased. Thus, confocal immunofluorescence analysis of cells transduced with the different baculovirus constructs or combinations thereof in the absence or presence of infecting CPV revealed that the VP1 protein is a prerequisite for efficient targeting of VP2 to the nucleus. The baculovirus vectors were functional and the genes of interest efficiently introduced to this CPV susceptible mammalian cell line. Thus, we show evidence that the system could be utilized to study targeting of the CPV capsid proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) elevated nitric oxide (NO) production without affecting intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in endothelial cells in situ on aortic valves, and induced prominent endothelium-dependent relaxation of coronary arteries, which was blocked by N(omega)-monomethyl-L-arginine, a NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor. N-SMase induced translocation of endothelial NOS (eNOS) from plasma membrane caveolae to intracellular region, eNOS phosphorylation on serine 1179, and an increase of ceramide level in endothelial cells. Membrane-permeable ceramide (C(8)-ceramide) mimicked the responses to N-SMase. We propose the involvement of N-SMase and ceramide in Ca(2+)-independent eNOS activation and NO production in endothelial cells in situ, linking to endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation.

Acquisition of essential somatic cell cycle regulatory protein expression

<ABSTRACT>
It is clear that G1-S phase control is exerted after the mouse embryo implants into the uterus 4.5 days after fertilization (E4.5); null mutants of genes that control cell cycle commitment such as max, rb (retinoblastoma), and dp1 are embryonic lethal after implantation with proliferation phenotypes. But, a number of studies of genes mediating proliferation control in the embryo after fertilization-implantation have yielded confusing results. In order to understand when embryos might first exert G1-S phase regulatory control, we assayed preimplantation mouse embryos for the acquisition of expression of mRNA, protein, and phospho-protein for max, Rb, and DP-1, and for the proliferation-promoting phospho-protein forms of mycC (thr58/ser62) and Rb (ser795). The key findings are that: (1) DP-1 protein was present in the nucleus as early as the four-cell stage onwards, (2) max protein was in the nucleus, suggesting function from the four-cell stage onwards, (3) both mycC and Rb all form protein was present at increasing quantities in the cytoplasm from the 2 cell and 4/8 cell stage, respectively, (4) the phosphorylated form of mycC phospho was present in the nucleus at high levels from the two-cell stage through blastocyst-stage, and (5) the phosphorylated form of Rb was detected at low levels in the two-cell stage embryo and was highly expressed at the 4/8-cell stage through the blastocyst stage. Taken together, these data suggest that activation of mycC phospho/max dimer pairs, (E2F)/DP-1 dimer pairs, and repression of Rb inhibition of cell cycle progression via phosphorylation at ser795 occurs at the earliest stages of embryonic development. In addition, the presence of max, mycC phospho, DP-1, and Rb phospho in the nuclei of embryonic and placental lineage cells in the blastocyst and in trophoblast stem cells suggests that a similar type of cell cycle regulation is present throughout preimplantation development and in both embryonic and extra-embryonic cell lineages.

<ABSTRACT>
The purpose of the present study is to identify bioactive compounds with potential for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) pharmacological therapy. Various plant natural products including flavonoids were tested for their ability to ameliorate the abnormality of very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) metabolism in cultured skin-fibroblasts from X-ALD patients. Of the compounds tested, baicalein 5,6,7-trimethyl ether (baicalein-tri-Me) was found to significantly stimulate the VLCFA beta-oxidation activity. Furthermore, the incorporation of [1-(14)C]lignoceric acid into cholesteryl esters was markedly reduced towards the normal level and the VLCFA (C24:0 and C26:0) content was decreased. These results make baicalein-tri-Me a candidate for the therapeutic compound for X-ALD.

GABA shunt deficiencies and accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates:
insight from Arabidopsis mutants.

<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):415-20.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In plants, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH)-deficiency results in the accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), necrotic lesions, dwarfism, and hypersensitivity to environmental stresses. We report that Arabidopsis ssadh knockout mutants contain five times the normal level of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), which in SSADH-deficient mammals accounts for phenotypic abnormalities. Moreover, the level of GHB in Arabidopsis is light dependent. Treatment with gamma-vinyl-gamma-aminobutyrate, a specific gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA)-transaminase inhibitor, prevents the accumulation of ROI and GHB in ssadh mutants, inhibits cell death, and improves growth. These results provide novel evidence for the relationship between the GABA shunt and ROI, which may, in part, explain the phenotype of SSADH-deficient plants and animals.

<ABSTRACT>
Here, we report the first investigation of a novel member of the LZT (LIV-1 subfamily of ZIP zinc Transporters) subfamily of zinc influx transporters. LZT subfamily sequences all contain a unique and highly conserved metalloprotease motif (HEXPHEXGD) in transmembrane domain V with both histidine residues essential for zinc transport by ZIP (Zrt-, Irt-like Proteins) transporters. We investigate here whether ZIP14 (SLC39A14), lacking the initial histidine in this motif, is still able to transport zinc. We demonstrate that this plasma membrane located glycosylated protein functions as a zinc influx transporter in a temperature-dependant manner.

<ABSTRACT>
Cytoplasmic volume undergoes a series of changes during mitosis in eukaryotes; in turn, signaling events such as osmotic stress can regulate the cytoplasmic volume in cells. In some organisms, increase in cytoplasmic-to-nuclear volume ratio was seen to affect the growth potential in cells, however, the mechanistics of such a regulation, if at all present, was unclear. In a computational model, we have constructed a growth factor-induced signaling pathway leading to AP-1 heterodimer formation through transcriptional regulation, and analyzed the effects of increasing the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio on c-jun transcription and AP-1 complex. We have observed that larger cytoplasmic volumes caused both an increase in the final AP-1 product and a delay in the time of AP-1 accumulation.

<ABSTRACT>
Resistin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes, is suggested to be an important link between obesity and diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the regulatory effect of estrogen on adipocyte resistin gene expression in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and in isolated rat adipocytes in vitro. Subcutaneous injection of estradiol benzoate reduced resistin mRNA levels in adipocytes isolated from the inguinal, parametrial, perirenal, retroperitoneal, or periovarian fat deposits of OVX rats, while an in vitro study showed that estradiol treatment decreased resistin mRNA levels in cultured rat periovarian fat adipocytes. Results of Western blotting analysis also showed that estrogen decreased adipose resistin contents in vivo and in vitro. These data suggest that estrogen is a pivotal negative regulator of resistin gene expression.

regulation.

<ABSTRACT>
The C-Raf kinase is regulated by numerous phosphorylation steps. To quantify the most prominent phosphorylation sites of C-Raf, we performed mass spectrometry analysis of wild-type C-Raf and the constitutively active C-Raf mutant C-Raf-Y340D/Y341D. We confirmed phosphorylation of most of the sites reported in the literature with the exception that we did not detect phosphorylation of threonine 268/269 (autophosphorylation sites) and threonine 491/serine 494 (kinase activation loop). Importantly, we detected novel phosphorylation sites at the positions of serine 296 and 301. The degree of phosphorylation in these positions depends on the level of activation of C-Raf. Furthermore, we show here, using point mutant forms of C-Raf kinases with serine to alanine and serine to aspartic acid substitution, that serines 296 and 301 contribute to negative regulation of C-Raf.

The cortical cytoskeleton of vascular endothelial cells plays an important role in responding to mechanical stimuli and controlling the distribution of cell surface proteins. Here, we have used atomic force microscopy to visualize the dynamics of cortical cytoskeleton in living bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. We demonstrate that the cortical cytoskeleton, organized as a complex polygonal mesh, is highly dynamic and shows two modes of remodeling: intact-boundary-mode where mesh element boundaries remain intact but move at approximately 0.08 microm/min allowing the mesh element to change shape, and altered-boundary-mode where new mesh boundaries form and existing ones disappear.

<ABSTRACT>
AMP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetases (ACSs) are ubiquitous in all three domains of life. Here, we report the first characterization of an ACS from a hyperthermophilic organism, from the archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum. The recombinant ACS, the gene product of ORF PAE2867, showed extremely high thermostability and thermoactivity at temperatures around 100 degrees C. In contrast to known monomeric or homodimeric mesophilic ACSs, the P. aerophilum ACS was a 610 kDa homooctameric protein, with a significant lower content of thermolabile (Cys, Asn, and Gln) and higher content of charged (Glu, Lys, and Arg) amino acids. Kinetic analyses revealed an unusual broad substrate spectrum for organic acids and an extremely high affinity for acetate (K(m) 3 microM).

PDZ-binding motifs are unable to ensure correct polarized protein
distribution in the absence of additional localization signals.

<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):483-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The C-terminal PDZ-binding motifs are required for polarized apical/basolateral localization of many membrane proteins. To determine the specificity of the PDZ-binding motifs in establishing cellular distribution, we utilized a 111-amino acid region from the C-terminus of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that is able to direct apical localization of fused reporter proteins. Substitution of the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of CFTR with corresponding motifs necessary for basolateral localization of other membrane proteins did not lead to the redistribution of the fusion protein to the basolateral membrane. Instead, some fusion proteins remained localized to the apical membrane, whereas others showed no specific distribution. The specificity of the PDZ-based interactions was substantially increased when specific amino acids located upstream of the classical PDZ-binding motifs were included. However, even the presence of a longer C-terminal motif from a basolateral protein could not ensure basolateral distribution of the fusion protein. Our results indicate that the C-terminal PDZ-binding motifs are not the primary signals for polarized protein distribution, although they are required for targeting and/or stabilization of protein at the given location.

MAGGY is a Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon, which was identified in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Some Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposons, including MAGGY, contain a chromodomain-like module (CLM) in the C-terminus of the integrase domain. We have made a series of MAGGY mutants to examine the role of the CLM in the transposition activity of the element. Introduction of a mutation at different positions in the MAGGY integrase revealed that a loss or alteration of the CLM resulted in a drastic decrease in the transposition activity of the element. Our results indicate that the CLM may confer high transposition activity to the element.

Immunodetection of partially glycosylated isoforms of alpha-dystroglycan
by a new monoclonal antibody against its beta-dystroglycan-binding

<ABSTRACT>
The alpha/beta dystroglycan (DG) complex links the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton. The extensive glycosylation of alpha-DG is believed to be crucial for the interaction with its extracellular matrix-binding partners. We characterized a monoclonal antibody, directed against the beta-DG-binding epitope ( approximately positions 550-565), which recognizes preferentially hypoglycosylated alpha-DG. In Western blot, the antibody was able to detect a number of partially glycosylated alpha-DG isoforms from rat brain and chicken skeletal muscle tissue samples. In addition, we demonstrated its inhibitory effect on the interaction between alpha- and beta-DG in vitro and preliminary immunostaining experiments suggest that such hypoglycosylated alpha-DG isoforms could play a role within cells.

Thermodynamic and EPR studies of slowly relaxing ubisemiquinone species in
the isolated bovine heart complex I.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):500-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Previously, we investigated ubisemiquinone (SQ) EPR spectra associated with NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) in the tightly coupled bovine heart submitochondrial particles (SMP). Based upon their widely differing spin relaxation rate, we distinguished SQ spectra arising from three distinct SQ species, namely SQ(Nf) (fast), SQ(Ns) (slow), and SQ(Nx) (very slow). The SQ(Nf) signal was observed only in the presence of the proton electrochemical gradient (deltamu(H)(+)), while SQ(Ns) and SQ(Nx) species did not require the presence of deltamu(H+). We have now succeeded in characterizing the redox and EPR properties of SQ species in the isolated bovine heart complex I. The potentiometric redox titration of the g(z,y,x)=2.00 semiquinone signal gave the redox midpoint potential (E(m)) at pH 7.8 for the first electron transfer step [E(m1)(Q/SQ)] of -45 mV and the second step [E(m2)(SQ/QH(2))] of -63 mV. It can also be expressed as [E(m)(Q/QH(2))] of -54 mV for the overall two electron transfer with a stability constant (K(stab)) of the SQ form as 2.0. These characteristics revealed the existence of a thermodynamically stable intermediate redox state, which allows this protein-associated quinone to function as a converter between n=1 and n=2 electron transfer steps. The EPR spectrum of the SQ species in complex I exhibits a Gaussian-type spectrum with the peak-to-peak line width of approximately 6.1 G at the sample temperature of 173 K. This indicates that the SQ species is in an anionic Q(-) state in the physiological pH range. The spin relaxation rate of the SQ species in isolated complex I is much slower than the SQ counterparts in the complex I in situ in SMP. We tentatively assigned slow relaxing anionic SQ species as SQ(Ns), based on the monophasic power saturation profile and several fold increase of its spin relaxation rate in the presence of reduced cluster N2. The current study also suggests that the very slowly relaxing SQ(Nx) species may not be an intrinsic complex I component. The functional role of SQ(Ns) is further discussed in connection with the SQ(Nf) species defined in SMP in situ.

Identification of a novel member of yeast mitochondrial Hsp70-associated

<ABSTRACT>
Here, we report the identification of yeast 15-kD Tim15/Zim17, a new member of mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70)-associated motor and chaperone (MMC) proteins. The 15-kD MMC protein is a peripheral inner membrane protein with a zinc-finger motif. Depletion of the 15-kD protein led to impaired import of presequence-containing proteins into the matrix in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of the 15-kD protein rescued the functional defects of mtHsp70 in ssc1-3 cells, and a fusion protein containing the 15-kD protein physically interacts with purified mtHsp70. Tim15/Zim17 therefore cooperates with mtHsp70 to facilitate import of presequence-containing proteins into the matrix.

A role for the non-phosphorylated form of yeast Snf1: tolerance to toxic
cations and activation of potassium transport.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):512-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Snf1/AMP-activated protein kinases play a key role in stress responses of eukaryotic cells. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Snf1 is regulated by glucose depletion, which triggers its phosphorylation at Thr210 and concomitant increase in activity. Activated yeast Snf1 is required for the metabolic changes allowing starvation tolerance and utilization of alternative carbon sources. We now report a function for the non-activated form of Snf1: the regulation of the Trk high-affinity potassium transporter, encoded by the TRK1 and TRK2 genes. A snf1Delta strain is hypersensitive in high-glucose medium to different toxic cations, suggesting a hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane driving increased cation uptake. This phenotype is suppressed by the TRK1 and HAL5 genes in high-copy number consistent with a defect in K(+) uptake mediated by the Trk system. Accordingly, Rb(+) uptake and intracellular K(+) measurements indicate that snf1Delta is unable to fully activate K(+) import. Genetic analysis suggests that the weak kinase activity of the non-phosphorylated form of Snf1 activates Trk in glucose-metabolizing yeast cells. The effect of Snf1 on Trk is probably indirect and could be mediated by the Sip4 transcriptional activator.

HCO(3)(-)-independent rescue from apoptosis by stilbene derivatives in rat
cardiomyocytes.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):517-22.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Apoptosis of rat cardiomyocytes induced by staurosporine is prevented by a stilbene derivative (DIDS), which is a known blocker of both Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchangers and Cl(-) channels. To clarify its target, staurosporine-induced activation of caspase-3, DNA laddering and cell death were examined in cultured rat cardiomyocytes. Removal of ambient HCO(3)(-), which minimizes the function of Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchangers, failed to affect the preventive effect of DIDS on apoptosis. A carboxylate analog Cl(-) channel blocker, which does not block Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchangers, also inhibited apoptotic events. Thus, rescue by DIDS of cardiomyocytes from apoptosis is mediated by blockage of Cl(-) channels.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):523-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
alphaArg-376, betaLys-155, and betaArg-182 are catalytically important ATP synthase residues that were proposed to be involved in substrate Pi binding and subsequent steps of ATP synthesis [Senior, A.E., Nadanaciva, S. and Weber, J. (2002) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1553, 188-211]. Here, it was shown using purified Escherichia coli F(1)-ATPase that whereas Pi protected wild-type from reaction with 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, mutations betaK155Q, betaR182Q, betaR182K, and alphaR376Q abolished protection. Therefore, in ATP synthesis initial binding of substrate Pi in open catalytic site betaE is supported by each of these three residues.

Inhibition of GSK3beta by indirubins restores HIF-1alpha accumulation
under prolonged periods of hypoxia/anoxia.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):529-33.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Hypoxia inducible factor 1 is regulated by the appearance of the HIF-1alpha subunit. HIF-1alpha is subjected to proteasomal destruction or enhanced protein translation, which requires the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. We investigated how PI3K/Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) affect HIF-1alpha in human RKO cells under prolonged periods of severe hypoxia/anoxia. 16- to 32-h lasting incubations attenuated Akt activity and decreased HIF-1alpha protein. This was reproduced by blocking PI3K with LY294002. GSK3beta inhibition by indirubins circumvented the effect of hypoxia/anoxia or LY294002 on HIF-1alpha. Ruling stability regulation of HIF-1alpha protein and/or enhanced transcription of HIF-1alpha mRNA via GSK3beta inhibition out is suggestive for translational modulation of HIF-1alpha under the influence of GSK3beta.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Although basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) is generally included in the media for maintenance of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), the action of FGF2 in these cells has not been well defined. Here, we determined the roles of FGF2 in maintaining hESC self-renewal. Withdrawal of FGF2 from the media led to acquisition of typical differentiated characteristics in hESCs. In the presence of FGF2, which is normally required for proliferation in an undifferentiated state, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/PKB signal stimulated differentiation and attenuated the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. We suggest that FGF2 maintains hESC self-renewal by supporting stable expression of ECM molecules through activation of the PI3K/Akt/PKB pathway.

A novel pesticide-induced conformational state of the oestrogen receptor
ligand-binding domain, detected by conformation-specific peptide binding.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):541-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The diverse effects of different natural and synthetic oestrogen receptor ligands depend on induction of different receptor conformations, allowing differential interactions with other transcription factors. Different conformations of the oestrogen receptor ligand binding domains can be monitored by conformation-specific binding to peptides selected from phage-displayed peptide libraries. We now report that a group of chlorinated pesticides, including 2,4-dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene, induces a peptide recognition pattern different from those induced by any one of the classical oestrogen receptor ligands. The pesticide-complexed oestrogen receptors recognized peptides reacting with the receptors complexed both with the natural oestrogen 17beta-oestradiol and with the synthetic partial antagonist 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, respectively, indicating that the pesticide-induced conformation shares features with both the 17beta-oestradiol- and the 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen-induced conformations. The substitution H524A in the ligand binding domain conferred the pesticide-specific peptide recognition pattern and transactivation activity to the oestradiol- and the 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen-complexed receptors, indicating that one important determinant of the pesticide-induced conformation is a lack of stabilisation of any one particular receptor conformation by ligand interaction with H524, which is known to interact with both oestradiol and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen. Thus, peptide binding analyses of oestrogen receptor conformations induced by environmental endocrine disruptors can give novel information about molecular mechanisms of oestrogen action in general.

Linking integrin to IP(3) signaling is important for ovulation in
Caenorhabditis elegans.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 17;579(2):549-53.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Signals from germ and myoepithelial sheath cells initiate ovulation in Caenorhabditis elegans. The coordinated dilation and contraction of spermatheca lead to subsequent fertilization of oocyte. Either the dominant negative mutant pat-3 beta integrin or disruption of talin expression block ovulation. Talin loss-of-function uncovers roles in cell contractility and migration in C. elegans. Role of beta pat-3 integrins in development and function of Caenorhabditis elegans muscles and gonads, suggesting that the interaction between the cell and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is also important for ovulation. Here, we report that integrin plays an essential role in fertility via IP(3) signaling. Sterility caused by RNAi of pat-3 and ECM molecules was suppressed by increased IP(3) signaling. Our data suggest that the cell-ECM interaction controls ovulation via IP(3) signaling.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In this study, the functional relevance of the core nucleotides of the RNA cleaving 10-23 DNA enzyme (DNAzyme) was investigated. Systematic deletion studies revealed that DNAzymes lacking thymine at position 8 (T8) retain catalytic activity comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme. Deletion of the adjacent cytosine at position 7 (C7) also resulted in a highly active enzyme and even the double deletion mutant C7/T8 displayed cleavage activity, although the catalytic rate under multiple turnover conditions was found to be reduced by one order of magnitude. The identification of non-essential nucleotides in the catalytic core might help to stabilize the DNAzyme against nucleolytic degradation and to overcome problems in elucidating its three-dimensional structure.

<ABSTRACT>
We report the development of a robust interface for off-line coupling of nano liquid chromatography (LC) to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and its application to the analysis of proteolytic digests of proteins, both isolated and in mixtures. The interface makes use of prestructured MALDI sample supports to concentrate the effluent to a small sample plate area and localize the MALDI sample to a predefined array, thereby enriching the analyte molecules and facilitating automated MALDI-MS analysis. Parameters that influence the preparation of MALDI samples from the LC effluent were evaluated with regard to detection sensitivity, spectra quality, and reproducibility of the method. A procedure for data processing is described. The presented nano LC MALDI-MS system allowed the detection of several peptides from a tryptic digest of bovine serum albumin, at analyzed amounts corresponding to one femtomole of the digested protein. For the identification of native proteins isolated from mouse brain by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, nano LC MALDI-MS increased the number of detected peptides, thereby allowing identification of proteins that could not be identified by direct MALDI-MS analysis. The ability to identify proteins in complex mixtures was evaluated for the analysis of Escherichia coli 50S ribosomal subunit. Out of the 33 expected proteins, 30 were identified by MALDI tandem time of flight fragment ion fingerprinting.

<ABSTRACT>
Quantitative protein profiling using the isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) method and tandem mass spectrometry (MS) enables the pair-wise comparison of protein expression levels in biological samples. A new version of the ICAT reagent with an acid-cleavable bond, which allows removal of the biotin moiety prior to MS and which utilizes (13)C substitution for (12)C in the heavy-ICAT reagent rather than (2)H (for (1)H) as in the original reagent, was investigated. We developed and validated an MS data acquisition strategy using this new reagent that results in an increased number of protein identifications per experiment, without losing the accuracy of protein quantification. This was achieved by following a single survey (precursor) ion scan and serial collision induced dissociations (CIDs) of four different precursor ions observed in the prior survey scan. This strategy is common to many high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization (HPLC-ESI)-MS shotgun proteomic strategies, but heretofore not to ICAT experiments. This advance is possible because the new ICAT reagent uses (13)C as the "heavy" element rather than (2)H, thus, eliminating the slight delay in retention time of ICAT-labeled "light" peptides on a C18-based HPLC separation that occurs with (2)H and (1)H. Analyses using this new scheme of an ICAT-labeled trypsin-digested six protein mixture as well as a tryptic digest of a total yeast lysate, indicated that about two times more proteins were identified in a single analysis, and that there was no loss in accuracy of quantification.

Quantitative analysis of both protein expression and serine / threonine
post-translational modifications through stable isotope labeling with

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(2):388-98.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
While phosphorylation and O-GlcNAc (cytoplasmic and nuclear glycosylation) are linked to normal and pathological changes in cell states, these post-translational modifications have been difficult to analyze in proteomic studies. We describe advances in beta-elimination / Michael addition-based approaches which allow for mass spectrometry-based identification and comparative quantification of O-phosphate or O-GlcNAc-modified peptides, as well as cysteine-containing peptides for expression analysis. The method (BEMAD) involves differential isotopic labeling through Michael addition with normal dithiothreitol (DTT) (d0) or deuterated DTT (d6), and enrichment of these peptides by thiol chromatography. BEMAD was comparable to isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT; a commercially available differential isotopic quantification technique) in protein expression analysis, but also provided the identity and relative amounts of both O-phosphorylation and O-GlcNAc modification sites. Specificity of O-phosphate vs. O-GlcNAc mapping is achieved through coupling enzymatic dephosphorylation or O-GlcNAc hydrolysis with differential isotopic labeling. Blocking of cysteine labeling by prior oxidation of a cytosolic lysate from mouse brain allowed specific targeting of serine / threonine post-translational modifications as demonstrated through identification of 21 phosphorylation sites (5 previously reported) in a single mass spectrometry analysis. These results demonstate BEMAD is suitable for large-scale quantitative analysis of both protein expression and serine / threonine post-translational modifications.

<ABSTRACT>
Rosacea and chronic urticaria are two common skin disorders existing in idiopathic forms. A role of Helicobacter pylori bacterium infection in the aetiopathogenesis of rosacea or chronic urticaria has been suggested although still controversial. The aim of the present study was to establish a relationship between H. pylori infection and rosacea chronic urticaria by means of an immunoproteomic investigation. We analyzed immunoglobulin A (IgA)-, IgG-, and IgE-mediated immune-responses against H. pylori antigens and we identified some bacterial immunoresponsive proteins. A general IgA- and IgE-mediated immune response against antioxidative bacterial proteins was observed. A correlation between the bacterial occurrence and skin diseases pathogenesis is discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
To contribute to physiology and pathophysiology of the glomerulus of human kidney, we have launched a proteomic study of human glomerulus, and compiled a profile of proteins expressed in the glomerulus of normal human kidney by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and identification with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and/or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Kidney cortices with normal appearance were obtained from patients under surgical nephrectomy due to renal tumor, and glomeruli were highly purified by a standard sieving method followed by picking-up under a phase-contrast microscope. The glomerular proteins were separated by 2-DE with 24 cm immobilized pH gradient strips in the 3-10 range in the first dimension and 26 x 20 cm sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels of 12.5% in the second dimension. Gels were silver-stained, and valid spots were processed for identification through an integrated robotic system that consisted of a spot picker, an in-gel digester, and a MALDI-TOF MS and / or a LC-MS/MS. From 2-DE gel images of glomeruli of four subjects with no apparent pathologic manifestations, a synthetic gel image of normal glomerular proteins was created. The synthetic gel image contained 1713 valid spots, of which 1559 spots were commonly observed in the respective 2-DE gels. Among the 1559 spots, 347 protein spots, representing 212 proteins, have so far been identified, and used for the construction of an extensible markup language (XML)-based database. The database is deposited on a web site (http://www.sw.nec.co.jp/bio/rd/hgldb/index.html) in a form accessible to researchers to contribute to proteomic studies of human glomerulus in health and disease.

<ABSTRACT>
Proteomics methodologies hold great promise in basic renal research and clinical nephrology. The classical approach for proteomic analysis couples two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) with protein identification by mass spectrometry, to produce more global information regarding normal protein expression and alterations in different physiological and pathological states. In this report we have expanded the identification of proteins in the renal cortex, improving the previously published map to facilitate the study of different diseases affecting the human kidney. About 250 spots were analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting, 89 proteins and 74 isoforms for some of them were identified and implemented in the normal human renal cortex 2-DE reference map. This more comprehensive view of the proteome of the human renal cortex could be of invaluable help to the differential proteomic display of urological diseases.

<ABSTRACT>
Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) directly coupled with electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a successful choice to obtain a large number of product ion spectra from a complex peptide mixture. We describe a search validation program, ScoreRidge, developed for analysis of LC-MS/MS data. The program validates peptide assignments to product ion spectra resulting from usual probability-based searches against primary structure databases. The validation is based only on correlation between the measured LC elution time of each peptide and the deduced elution time from the amino acid sequence assigned to product ion spectra obtained from the MS/MS analysis of the peptide. Sufficient numbers of probable assignments gave a highly correlative curve. Any peptide assignments within a certain tolerance from the correlation curve were accepted for the following arrangement step to list identified proteins. Using this data validation program, host protein candidates responsible for interaction with human hepatitis B virus core protein were identified from a partially purified protein mixture. The present simple and practical program complements protein identification from usual product ion search algorithms and reduces manual interpretation of the search result data. It will lead to more explicit protein identification from complex peptide mixtures such as whole proteome digests from tissue samples.

beta-Phenylethyl isothiocyanate mediated apoptosis: a proteomic
investigation of early apoptotic protein changes.

Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):1075-82.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
beta-Phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) is a promising chemopreventative agent found in abundance in watercress (Rorripa nasturtium aquaticum) as its glucosinolate precursor. In the present investigation, we sought to determine the early changes in protein expression that contribute to the mechanism(s) of PEITC-mediated apoptosis in the human hepatoma HepG2 cell line. Such data may invariably identify new molecular targets of PEITC, contributing to a greater understanding of the mechanism(s) by which isothiocyanates mediate apoptotic cascades. Using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis we determined the changes in global protein expression between control (0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide) and PEITC (IC50 approximately 20 microM) treated cells after 3 and 6 h, such time points being used to circumvent the effects of caspase mediate proteolysis. Comparison between PEITC treated cells with their respective controls showed that 17 protein spots were differentially expressed. Fourteen of these spots, representing 9 unique proteins, were successfully identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption / ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and MALDI tandem time of flight (TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry. We observed significant shifts in isoelectric points on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels in heat shock 27 kDa protein (HSP27), macrophage migration inhibition factor and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) indicating that these proteins are probably involved in protein phosphorylation. Indeed, hnRNP K was determined to be phosphorylated on key tyrosine residues as assessed by using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. In separate experiments we also showed that c-myc is up-regulated in PEITC treated cells, and since hnRNP K is reported to induce overexpression of c-myc, we proposed that PEITC-induced apoptosis may involve a c-myc dependent apoptotic pathway in HepG2 cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Instead of using the probability mean, a simple and yet effective heuristic approach was employed to treat experimentally obtained tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data for protein identification. The proposed approach is based on the total number (T) of identified experimental MS/MS data. To warrant the subsequent ranking, the total number of identified b- and y-type ions (Tb+y) must be greater than 50% of T. Peptides having the same T and Tb+y are either ranked by the contiguity of identified ions or discarded during identification. When compared to other protein identification tools, good agreement with the searched results was seen.

Identification of grass pollen allergens by two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis and serological screening.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(3):729-36.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Approximately 50% of allergic patients are sensitized against grass pollen allergens. The characterization of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactivity to allergen components in pollen-allergic patients is fundamental for clinical diagnosis and for immunotherapy. Complex allergen extracts are commonly used in diagnostic tests as well as in immunotherapy preparations, but their composition in single allergenic molecules is only partially known. Diagnostic tests which utilize recombinant or immuno-purified allergens have been made available in clinical practice. They allow to obtain specific profiles of IgE reactivity, but the panel of available molecules is far from complete. Here, we used a proteomic approach in order to detect grass allergens from a natural protein extract. A five-grass pollen extract used for diagnosis and immunotherapy was resolved by two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), and assayed with 9 sera from pollen-allergic patients whose sensitization profile was dissected by using IgE reactivity to recombinant allergens. 2-DE immunoreactivity patterns were matched with IgE reactivity to identify protein spots as candidate allergens. Identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. We identified 6 out of 8 expected clinically relevant allergens in the natural grass extract. Moreover, we identified different molecular isoforms of single allergens, thus obtaining a more detailed profile of IgE reactivity. Some discrepancies in protein isoform profile and sera immunoreactivity between recombinant and native allergen 5 from Phleum pratense were observed and a new putative allergen was described. The proteomic approach applied to the analysis of a natural allergen allows the comprehensive evaluation of the sensitization profile of allergic patients and the identification of new allergens.

Numerical approaches for quantitative analysis of two-dimensional maps: a
review of commercial software and home-made systems.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(3):654-66.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The present review attempts to cover a number of methods that have appeared in the last few years for performing quantitative proteome analysis. However, due to the large number of methods described for both electrophoretic and chromatographic approaches, we have limited this review to conventional two-dimensional (2-D) map analysis which couples orthogonally a charge-based step (isoelectric focusing) to a size-based separation step (sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis). The first and oldest method applied to 2-D map data reduction is based on statistical analysis performed on sets of gels via powerful software packages, such as Melanie, PDQuest, Z3 and Z4000, Phoretix and Progenesis. This method calls for separately running a number of replicas for control and treated samples. The two sets of data are then merged and compared via a number of software packages which we describe. In addition to commercially-available systems, a number of home made approaches for 2-D map comparison have been recently described and are also reviewed. They are based on fuzzyfication of the digitized 2-D gel image coupled to linear discriminant analysis, three-way principal component analysis or a combination of principal component analysis and soft-independent modeling of class analogy. These statistical tools appear to perform well in differential proteomic studies.

Immunoaffinity reactors for prion protein qualitative analysis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(3):639-47.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The cellular prion protein (PrPc) represents the substrate for generation of conformational aberrant PrP isoforms which occur in human and animal prion diseases. The published two-dimensional maps of human PrPc show a vast microheterogeneity of this glycoprotein. The main goal of this project was to develop a highly specific immunoaffinity reactor for qualitative analysis of PrP cellular isoforms isolated from brain homogenate, cerebrospinal fluid and other tissues. New techniques for affinity proteomics, carriers and immobilization chemistry were applied. The choice of matrix (chemical and magnetic properties, particle size and distribution, porosity) was the key factor that influenced the quality of the reactor and the nature of final applications. Mouse anti-prion IgGs directed to N-terminal and C-terminal epitopes (residues 23-40 and 147-165) were grafted in different manners to magnetic micro- and nanoparticles particularly developed for micro-CHIP application. High operational and storage stability of affinity reactors with minimized nonspecific absorption were achieved. The quality of the immunoreactors was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting and by two-dimensional electrophoresis.

Renal and urinary proteomics: current applications and challenges.

Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):1033-42.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
During the past few years, proteomics has been extensively applied to various fields of medicine including nephrology. Current applications of renal and urinary proteomics are to better understand renal physiology, to explore the complexity of disease mechanisms, and to identify novel biomarkers and new therapeutic targets. This review provides some examples and perspectives of how proteomics can be applied to nephrology and how experimental data can be linked to physiology, functional significance and clinical applications. In some instances, proteomic analysis can be utilized to generate a new hypothesis from a set of candidates that are obtained from expression studies. The new hypothesis can then be addressed rapidly by conventional molecular biology methods, as demonstrated by identification of an altered renal elastin-elastase system in diabetic nephropathy and alterations in the renal kallikrein-kallistatin pathway in hypoxia-induced hypertension. The strengths and limitations of proteomics in renal research are summarized. Optimization of analytical protocols is required to overcome current limitations. Applications of proteomics to nephrology will then be more fruitful and successful.

Two-dimensional mapping as a tool for classification of green coffee bean
species.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(3):710-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Two species of the genus Coffea, Coffea arabica (Colombia) and Coffea canephora (Indiano Robusta) were analysed by two-dimensional (2-D) maps in order to obtain fingerprints of the expressed polypeptide chains and to determine which ones would characterize the two species. Green beans were milled under liquid nitrogen. A dry powder was produced by three different extraction protocols aimed at eliminating interfering substances (polyphenols). A reduced powder was produced by two successive extractions performed in acetone. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA; 10% w/v) and beta-mercaptoethanol (0.07% v/v) in acetone were used for the first extraction (a) and 10% w/v TCA in acetone was used for the second extraction (b). Proteins were then solubilized in a solution (40 microL per 1 mg powder) containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 3% w/v 3-(3-cholamidopropyldimethyl-amino)-1-propanesulfate, 1% v/v carrier ampholytes, 40 mM Tris, 5 mM tributylphosphine and 10 mM acrylamide as alkylating agent. Following incubation at room temperature for 1 hour and centrifugation (7000 rpm for 20 minutes), the supernatant was used for 2-D electrophoresis. The proteins were revealed by Sypro Ruby staining. Master maps of the five replicas of each species were compared by PDQuest analysis. The results of this differential proteome analysis were: sixteen proteins were expressed solely in C. canephora (var. Indiano Robusta) and five proteins were only found in C. arabica (var. Colombia). Another eight proteins were up-regulated in C. canephora (var. Indiano Robusta) in comparison to C. arabica (var. Colombia) and one was down-regulated in the same comparison. A number of these polypeptide chains were further characterized by mass spectrometry in the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mode. Additionally, considering the low number of protein sequences of Coffea present in the databases we also investigated some spots with a more powerful tool, reversed phase-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry, thus obtaining an internal peptide sequence. The general properties of the identified proteins are presented and discussed.

The aggravating role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in
neurodegeneration.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):571-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Association of protein inclusions or aggregates within brain tissues of patients with neurodegenerative disorders has been widely reported. These inclusions are commonly characterised both by the presence of ubiquitylated proteins and the sequestration of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Such observations have led to the proposition that the UPS has a direct role in their formation. Indeed, the presence of ubiquitylated proteins and UPS components in inclusions may reflect unsuccessful attempts by the UPS to remove aggregating proteins. Whether the physical presence of inclusions causes cell death or, conversely, whether they are non-toxic and their presence reflects a cellular protective mechanism remains highly controversial.

Cortactin phosphorylation as a switch for actin cytoskeletal network and

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):577-85.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cortactin is an important molecular scaffold for actin assembly and organization. Novel mechanistic functions of cortactin have emerged with more interacting partners identified, revealing its multifaceted roles in regulating actin cytoskeletal networks that are necessary for endocytosis, cell migration and invasion, adhesion, synaptic organization and cell morphogenesis. These processes are mediated by its multi-domains binding to F-actin and Arp2/3 complex and various SH3 targets. Furthermore, its role in actin remodeling is subjected to regulation by tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying cortactin phosphorylation and its functional consequences would provide new insights to various aspects of cell dynamics control.

Mimotope-hormesis and mortalin/grp75/mthsp70: a new hypothesis on how
infectious disease-associated epitope mimicry may explain low cancer
burden in developing nations.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):586-90.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
It is generally observed that countries with heavy infectious burden show lower cancer incidence as compared to more affluent nations. With the emerging paradigm on microbial heat shock proteins (hsps) as molecular link between infections and autoimmune diseases, we posit a new hypothesis, the "mimotope-hormesis", on the immunologic impact of infections on regional cancer prevention. According to this, assaults of infection during early adulthood could fortify the immune system to evoke more potent defenses against late-onset diseases, such as cancer, via autoimmunity. Interestingly, both experimental and clinical data support the beneficial role of autoimmunity in long-term cancer survivors. We illustrate this by a comprehensive in silico mimotope (epitope mimicry) analysis of human infectious pathogens against mortalin (mthsp70/PB74/GRP75), a type of hsp70 protein involved in control of cell proliferation, immortalization and tumorigenesis.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):591-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Genomes, functional genomics data and 3D structure reflect different aspects of protein function. Here, we combine these data to predict that BolA, a widely distributed protein family with unknown function, is a reductase that interacts with a glutaredoxin. Comparisons at the 3D structure level as well as at the sequence profile level indicate homology between BolA and OsmC, an enzyme that reduces organic peroxides. Complementary to this, comparative analyses of genomes and genomics data provide strong evidence of an interaction between BolA and the mono-thiol glutaredoxin family. The interaction between BolA and a mono-thiol glutaredoxin is of particular interest because BolA does not, in contrast to its homolog OsmC, have evolutionarily conserved cysteines to provide it with reducing equivalents. We propose that BolA uses the mono-thiol glutaredoxin as the source for these.

Stochastic variation in the concentration of a repressor activates GAL
genetic switch: implications in evolution of regulatory network.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):597-603.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a recessive mutation in the signal transducer encoded by GAL3 leads to a significant lag in the induction of GAL genes, referred to as long term adaptation phenotype (LTA). Further, gal3 mutation in combination with other genetic defects leads to the non-inducibility of GAL genes. It was shown that the expression of GAL1 encoded galactokinase, a redundant GAL3 like signal transducer, eventually substitutes for the lack of GAL3 signal transduction function. However, how GAL1 gets induced in the absence of GAL3 is not clear. We hypothesize that GAL1 induction in gal3 cells exposed to galactose is due to a stochastic decrease in the repressor, Gal80p concentration, leading to heterogeneity in the population. This observation explains not only LTA observed in gal3 cells but also explains the non-inducibility of gal3 mutants in combination with other genetic defects. By recruiting a dedicated signal transducer, GAL3, S. cerevisiae GAL switch has evolved to overcome the fortuitous induction, which occurs due to low signal to noise ratio in certain mutants of Escherichia coli and Kluveromyces lactis.

<ABSTRACT>
Axotrophin (axot) is a newly characterised stem cell gene and mice that lack axotrophin are viable and fertile, but show premature neural degeneration and defective development of the corpus callosum. By comparing axot+/+, axot+/- and axot-/- littermates, we now show that axotrophin is also involved in immune regulation. Both T cell proliferation and T cell-derived leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were suppressed by axotrophin in a gene-dose-dependent manner. Moreover, a role for axotrophin in the feedback regulation of LIF is implicated. This is the first evidence that fate determination mediated by LIF maybe qualified by axotrophin.

Activation of the transcription factor NFAT1: concerted or modular
regulation?
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):621-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The transcription factor NFAT1 is activated through dephosphorylation of multiple serine residues, contained within the SRR1 and SP motifs. The phosphorylation status of these motifs regulates the subcellular localisation of NFAT1 via a conformational switch. Here, we discuss two molecular mechanisms for NFAT1 activation that resemble network-oriented approaches. In the modular mechanism, import and export are regulated separately by the SRR1 and SP motifs, respectively, whereas in the concerted model all residues jointly control both processes. Using simulations of a computational model, we show that both mechanisms may be compatible with recent experimental data on the import and export kinetics of NFAT1.

<ABSTRACT>
We performed a docking study followed by a 500-ps molecular dynamics simulation of R-state human adult hemoglobin (HbA) complexed to different heterotropic effectors [2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG), inositol hexaphosphate (IHP), and 2-[4-[(3,5-dichlorophenylcarbamoyl)-]methyl]-phenoxy]-2-methylpropionic acid (RSR13)) to propose a molecular basis for recently reported interactions of effectors with oxygenated hemoglobin. The simulations were carried out with counterions and explicit solvation. As reported for T-state HbA, the effector binding sites are also located in the central cavity of the R-state and differ depending on effector anionic character. DPG and IHP bind between the alpha-subunits and the RSR13 site spans the alpha1-, alpha2- and beta2-subunits. The generated models provide the first report of the molecular details of R-state HbA bound to heterotropic effectors.

<ABSTRACT>
The mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers (AACs) catalyze the exchange of cytosolic ADP for matrix ATP. We have identified and characterized a novel member of the AAC subfamily of mitochondrial metabolite transport proteins, termed AAC4. The AAC4 gene maps to human chromosome 4q28.1, and its product AAC4 is 66-68% identical to human AAC 1-3 and is localized to mitochondria. AAC4 transcripts are exclusively present in liver, testis and brain unlike those of AAC 1-3. Consistent with its belonging to the AAC subfamily, upon heterologous expression and reconstitution into liposomes AAC4 exchanges ADP for ATP by an electrogenic antiport mechanism with high specificity and high sensitivity to carboxyatractyloside and bongkrekic acid.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are neurodegenerative disorders affecting humans and animals. At present, it is not possible to recognize individuals incubating the disease before the clinical symptoms appear. We investigated the effectiveness of the "Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification" (PMCA) technology to detect the protease-resistance disease-associated prion protein (PrP(res)) in pre-symptomatic stages. PMCA allowed detection of PrP(res) in the brain of pre-symptomatic hamsters, enabling a clear identification of infected animals as early as two weeks after inoculation. Furthermore, PMCA was able to amplify minute quantities of PrP(res) from a variety of experimental and natural TSEs. Finally, PMCA allowed the demonstration of PrP(res) in an experimentally infected cow 32 month post-inoculation, that did not show clinical signs and was negative by standard Western blot analysis. Our findings indicate that PMCA may be useful for the development of an ultra-sensitive diagnostic test to minimize the risk of further propagation of TSEs.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Adenosine deaminase isoenzyme 2 (ADA2) was isolated from human pleural fluid for the first time. Molecular and kinetic properties were characterized. It was shown that the inhibitors of adenosine deaminase isoenzyme 1 (ADA1), adenosine, and erithro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA) derivatives are poor inhibitors of ADA2. Comparison of the interaction of ADA2 and ADA1 with adenosine and its derivative, 1-deazaadenosine, indicates that the isoenzymes have similar active centers. The absence of ADA2 inhibition by EHNA is evidence of a difference of these active centers in a close environment. The possible role of Zn2+ ions and the participation of acidic amino acids Glu and Asp in adenosine deamination catalyzed by ADA2 were shown.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Plasmodium falciparum, the etiologic agent of malaria, is a facultative intracellular parasite of the phylum Apicomplexa. A limited turnover of microfilaments takes place beneath the parasite plasma membrane, but the cytoplasm of apicomplexans is virtually devoid of F-actin. We produced Plasmodium actin in yeast. Purified recombinant Plasmodium actin polymerized inefficiently unless both gelsolin and phalloidin were added. The resulting actin polymers appeared fragmented in the fluorescence microscope. Plasmodium actin bound DNaseI about 200 times weaker than bovine non-muscle actin. Our findings suggest that the unique properties of Plasmodium actin can explain some of the unusual features of apicomplexan parasite microfilaments.

Cofactor fingerprinting with STD NMR to characterize proteins of unknown

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):661-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteomics efforts have created a need for better strategies to functionally categorize newly discovered proteins. To this end, we have employed saturation transfer difference NMR with pools of closely related cofactors, to determine cofactor preferences. This approach works well for dehydrogenases and has also been applied to cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins. In the latter application, a protein (radial spoke protein-2, RSP2) that plays a central role in forming the radial spoke of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagella was shown to bind cCMP. cCMP-binding proteins are rare, although previous reports of their presence in sperm and flagella suggest that cCMP may have a more general role in flagellar function. 31P NMR was used to monitor the preferential hydrolysis of ATP versus GTP, suggesting that RSP2 is a kinase.

Primary structure of the nuclear forms of phospholipid hydroperoxide
glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) in rat spermatozoa.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):667-70.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase is a monomeric Se-peroxidase highly expressed in mammalian male germ cells. Its nuclear form, sperm nuclei glutathione peroxidase (snGPx), has been originally identified in maturating spermatozoa as a transcription product containing an alternative exon within the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase gene. In this paper, we show that this form is inconstantly detectable in rat spermatozoa where a 20.0 and 25.9 kDa major forms are detected instead. These have been conclusively characterized. The N-terminus sequence of the 20.0 kDa form confirmed that the protein is identical to cytosolic form, suggesting diffusion into the nucleus. The 25.9 kDa protein represented a truncated form of the previously described nuclear snGPx, lacking the basic nuclear localization signal. This protein is present in two forms differing from each other by the presence of an N-terminal methionine. The presence of traces of the larger snGPx form suggests that exhaustive proteolytic processing of the precursor produces the 25.9 kDa enzyme, although the alternate use of a downstream ATG, at least in rodents, could not be unequivocally ruled out.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):671-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Chronic ethanol exposure increases the density of N-type calcium channels in brain. We report that ethanol increases levels of mRNA for a splice variant of the N channel specific subunit alpha1 2.2 that lacks exon 31a. Whole cell recordings demonstrated an increase in N-type current with a faster activation rate and a shift in activation to more negative potentials after chronic alcohol exposure, consistent with increased abundance of channels containing this variant. These results identify a novel mechanism whereby chronic ethanol exposure can increase neuronal excitability by altering levels of channel splice variants.

No role of DT-diaphorase (NQO1) in the protection against oxidized
quercetin.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):677-82.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Quercetin is one of the most studied alimentary antioxidants. During its antioxidant activity, quercetin becomes oxidized into its ortho-quinone/quinone methide, denoted as QQ. QQ is toxic since it is highly reactive towards thiols. DT-diaphorase (NQO1) might protect against QQ toxicity by reducing QQ to quercetin. However, conflicting data have been reported. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the role of DT-diaphorase in the protection against QQ-mediated thiol reactivity. It was found that QQ is indeed a substrate for DT-diaphorase. However, QQ reacted much faster with glutathione or protein thiols than with DT-diaphorase in experiments with isolated compounds as well as with human liver cytosol or blood plasma. This indicates that DT-diaphorase has no role in the protection against QQ.

<ABSTRACT>
Large amounts of refined sequence material in the form of predicted, curated and annotated genes and expressed sequences tags (ESTs) have recently been added to the NCBI databases. We matched the transcript-sequences of RefSeq, Ensembl and dbEST in an attempt to provide an updated overview of how many unique human genes can be found. The results indicate that there are about 25000 unique genes in the union of RefSeq and Ensembl with 12-18% and 8-13% of the genes in each set unique to the other set, respectively. About 20% of all genes had splice variants. There are a considerable number of ESTs (2200000) that do not match the identified genes and we used an in-house pipeline to identify 22 novel genes from Genscan predictions that have considerable EST coverage. The study provides an insight into the current status of human gene catalogues and shows that considerable refinement of methods and datasets is needed to come to a conclusive gene count.

Selective suppression of Toll-like receptor 4 activation by chemokine
receptor 4.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):699-704.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The response of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is thought vital for resisting infection. Since aberrant TLR4 signaling may initiate inflammatory conditions such as the sepsis syndrome, we sought a component of normal cells that might provide local control of TLR4 activation. We found that antibodies that block chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) function enhanced TLR4 signaling, while increased expression of CXCR4 or addition of the CXCR4 ligand SDF-1 suppressed TLR4 signaling induced by LPS. These findings suggest that CXCR4 could exert local control of TLR4 and suggest the possibility of new therapeutic approaches to suppression of TLR4 function.

Chrysin suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression
through the inhibition of nuclear factor for IL-6 (NF-IL6) DNA-binding
activity.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):705-11.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Chrysin is a natural, biologically active compound extracted from many plants, honey and propolis. It possesses potent anti-inflammation, anti-cancer and anti-oxidation properties. The mechanism by which chrysin suppresses COX-2 expression remains poorly understood. In the present report, we investigated the effect of chrysin on the expression of COX-2 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated Raw 264.7 cells. Chrysin significantly suppressed the LPS-induced COX-2 protein and mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. The ability of chrysin to suppress the expression of the COX-2 was investigated using luciferase reporters controlled by various cis-elements in COX-2 promoter region. Mutational analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay verified that nuclear factor for IL-6 was identified as responsible for the chrysin-mediated COX-2 downregulation. These results will provide new insights into the anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties of chrysin.

Tuning electron transfer by ester-group of chlorophylls in bacterial

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):712-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Accessory chlorophylls (B(A/B)) in bacterial photosynthetic reaction center play a key role in charge-separation. Although light-exposed and dark-adapted bRC crystal structures are virtually identical, the calculated B(A) redox potentials for one-electron reduction differ. This can be traced back to different orientations of the B(A) ester-group. This tuning ability of chlorophyll redox potentials modulates the electron transfer from SP* to B(A).

Activation of UCPs gene expression in skeletal muscle can be independent

model of mouse cancer cachexia.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):717-22.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Implantation of a fast growing tumour to mice (Lewis lung carcinoma) resulted in a clear cachectic state characterized by a profound muscle wasting. This was accompanied by a significant increase in both UCP2 and UCP3 gene expression in skeletal muscle and heart. Interestingly, this increase in gene expression was not linked to a rise in circulating fatty acids or in a decrease in food intake, as previously reported in other pathophysiological states. These results question the concept that hyperlipaemia is the only factor controlling UCP gene expression in different pathophysiological conditions. In addition, the present work suggests that UCPs might participate in a counter-regulatory mechanism to lower the production of ROS.

Valproic acid induces apoptosis dependent of Yca1p at concentrations that

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):723-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Valproic acid (VPA) inhibited the growth of yeast in a dose-dependent manner with complete inhibition attained at 100 mM. When cells were exposed to 25 mM VPA, the wild-type died showing apoptotic markers, while yca1Delta deleted of YCA1 encoding yeast caspase 1 survived. On the other hand, when cells were exposed to 50 mM VPA, both the wild-type and yca1Delta died showing morphological features similar to those of the autophagic death of cdc28 which was also independent of YCA1. Thus, these results suggested that yeast cells die via YCA1-dependent apoptosis when their proliferative activity is mildly impaired.

5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase from Staphylococcus aureus is
insensitive to glyphosate.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):728-32.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) catalyzes the penultimate step of the shikimate pathway, and is the target of the broad-spectrum herbicide glyphosate. Kinetic analysis of the cloned EPSPS from Staphylococcus aureus revealed that this enzyme exerts a high tolerance to glyphosate, while maintaining a high affinity for its substrate phosphoenolpyruvate. Enzymatic activity is markedly influenced by monovalent cations such as potassium or ammonium, which is due to an increase in catalytic turnover. However, insensitivity to glyphosate appears to be independent from the presence of cations. Therefore, we propose that the Staphylococcus aureus EPSPS should be classified as a class II EPSPS. This research illustrates a critical mechanism of glyphosate resistance naturally occurring in certain pathogenic bacteria.

Endogenous nitric oxide activation protects against cigarette smoking
induced apoptosis in endothelial cells.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):733-40.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cigarette-induced endothelial dysfunction could be an early mediator of atherosclerosis. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) apoptosis. We found that 10-65% of HAECs underwent apoptotic changes when HAECs were exposed to 0.001-0.02 cigarette equivalent unit of CSE for 4 h. CSE activated the caspases-3 and 8, the p38 MAP kinase and stress activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (SAPK/JNK). Specific inhibitors of p38 MAP or SAPK/JNK reduced CSE-induced caspase activation. We further showed that eNOS pre-activation by L-arginine reduced endothelial apoptosis from 65% to 5%; and eNOS inhibition by N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester accentuated CSE-induced endothelial apoptosis. We suggest that appropriate endogenous NO production may be an important protective mechanism against smoking-induced endothelial damage.

Extracellular copper ions regulate cellular prion protein (PrPC)
expression and metabolism in neuronal cells.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):741-4.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The physiological functions of cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) remain unclear. It has been demonstrated that PrP(C) is a copper binding protein and proposed that its functions could be strictly linked to copper metabolism and neuroprotection. The aim of this study was to clarify how extracellular copper modifies PrP(C) expression and metabolism in cultured neurones. We reported here that copper delivered at physiological concentrations significantly decreases PrP(C) mRNA expression in GN11 neurones. Moreover, copper increases the release of PrP(C) into the culture medium. These results indicate that extracellular copper strongly affects the amount of cellular PrP and might represent an interesting strategy to decrease the expression of PrP(C) in neurones and its conversion in the pathological isoform PrP(Sc).

The conserved histidine 106 of large thioredoxin reductases is likely to
have a structural role but not a base catalyst function.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):745-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The catalytic activity of selenocysteine-containing thioredoxin reductases can be mimicked by cysteine-variants if the local environment at the C-terminal redox center supports thiol activation. This concept of a linear catalytic site was challenged by structural data suggesting that the invariant residue His106 functions as a base catalyst for the dithiol-disulphide exchange reaction between enzyme and substrate. As reported here, we changed His106 to asparagine, glutamine, and phenylalanine in various C-terminal mutants of Drosophila melanogaster thioredoxin reductase. The catalytic activity dropped considerably, yet pH-profiles did not reveal differences, rendering a function for His106 as a base catalyst unlikely. Interestingly, the phenylalanine-mutants, designed as negative controls were the most active mutants which suggests rather a structural role of His106.

<ABSTRACT>
This study investigates to what extent the expression of the slow myosin heavy chain (MyHCI) isoform and the slow type sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a) isoform are co-regulated in fibers of regenerating skeletal soleus muscle. Both overexpression of cain, a calcineurin inhibitor, or partial tenotomy prevented the expression of MyHCI but left SERCA2a expression unaffected in fibers of regenerating soleus muscles. These data complement those from different experimental models and clearly show that the expression of MyHCI and SERCA2a--the major proteins mediating, respectively, the slow type of contraction and relaxation--are not coregulated in regenerating soleus muscle.

<ABSTRACT>
Accumulation in brain of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is considered as crucial pathogenic event causing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Anti-Abeta immune therapy is a powerful means for Abeta clearance from the brain. We recently showed that intravenous injections of anti-Abeta antibodies led to reduction, elevation or no change in brain Abeta42 concentrations of an AD mouse model. We report here, in a second passive immunization protocol, a different bioactivity of same antibodies to alter brain Abeta42 concentrations. Comparing the bioactivity of anti-Abeta antibodies in these two passive immunization paradigms underscores the potential of immune therapy for AD treatment and suggests that both the epitope recognized by the antibody and the mode of antibody administration are crucial for its biological activity.

<ABSTRACT>
MLL is involved in the process of gene activity maintenance. It is shown that the amino-terminal region of MLL (MLLN) interacts with TAF-Ibeta/SET. In this study, using yeast two-hybrid assays, we have found that the acidic region of TAF-Ibeta is essential for its binding to MLLN. Pull-down assays using GST-MLLN demonstrated that TAF-Ibeta and histones interact with GST-MLLN. MLLN and TAF-Ibeta synergistically upregulated the transcription level of Hoxa9 and co-immunoprecipitated in chromatin containing the Hoxa9 promoter region. These results suggest that TAF-Ibeta plays an important role in MLL-mediated transcription and possibly chromatin maintenance.

Fine tuning of coenzyme specificity in family 2 aldo-keto reductases

tenuis xylose reductase (AKR2B5) bound to NAD+ and NADP+.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):763-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Aldo-keto reductases of family 2 employ single site replacement Lys-->Arg to switch their cosubstrate preference from NADPH to NADH. X-ray crystal structures of Lys-274-->Arg mutant of Candida tenuis xylose reductase (AKR2B5) bound to NAD+ and NADP+ were determined at a resolution of 2.4 and 2.3A, respectively. Due to steric conflicts in the NADP+-bound form, the arginine side chain must rotate away from the position of the original lysine side chain, thereby disrupting a network of direct and water-mediated interactions between Glu-227, Lys-274 and the cofactor 2'-phosphate and 3'-hydroxy groups. Because anchoring contacts of its Glu-227 are lost, the coenzyme-enfolding loop that becomes ordered upon binding of NAD(P)+ in the wild-type remains partly disordered in the NADP+-bound mutant. The results delineate a catalytic reaction profile for the mutant in comparison to wild-type.

Inhibition of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels by cannabinoid receptors in
single cerebrocortical nerve terminals.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):768-72.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Since cannabinoid receptors inhibit excitatory synaptic transmission by reducing glutamate release, we have examined whether this might occur through the direct inhibition of presynaptic Ca2+ channels. In cerebrocortical nerve terminals, activation of cannabinoid receptors with WIN55,212-2 reduces the KCl-evoked release of glutamate. However, this inhibition is attenuated when N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels are blocked. Through Ca2+ imaging in single nerve terminals, we found that WIN55,212-2 reduced the influx of Ca2+ both in nerve terminals that contain N-type Ca2+ channels and those that contain P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. Thus, cannabinoid receptors modulate the two major Ca2+ channels coupled to glutamate release in the cerebral cortex.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Caenorhabditis elegans PMR1, a P-type Ca2+/Mn2+ ATPase, is expressed in hypodermal seam cells, intestinal cells and spermatheca; localized in Golgi complex. Knock down of pmr-1 as well as overexpression of truncated Caenorhabditis elegans PMR1, which mimics dominant mutations observed in human Hailey-Hailey disease, renders the worm highly sensitive to EGTA and Mn2+. Interestingly, pmr-1 knock down not only causes animals to become resistant to oxidative stress but also suppresses high reactive oxygen species sensitivity of smf-3 RNA-mediated interference and daf-16 worms. These findings suggest that C. elegans PMR1 has important roles in Ca2+ and Mn2+ homeostasis and oxidative stress response.

The plant P1B-type ATPase AtHMA4 transports Zn and Cd and plays a role in
detoxification of transition metals supplied at elevated levels.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):783-91.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The transition metal Zn is essential for many physiological processes in plants, yet at elevated concentrations this, and the related non-essential metal Cd, can be toxic. Arabidopsis thaliana HMA4, belonging to the Type P1B subfamily of P-type ATPases, has recently been implicated in Zn nutrition, having a role in root to shoot Zn translocation. Using Arabidopsis insertional mutants, it is shown here that disruption of AtHMA4 function also results in increased sensitivity to elevated levels of Cd and Zn, suggesting that AtHMA4 serves an important role in metal detoxification at higher metal concentrations. AtHMA4 and a truncated form lacking the last 457 amino acids both confer Cd and Zn resistance to yeast but a mutant version of the full-length AtHMA4 (AtHMA4-C357G) does not; this demonstrates that the C-terminal region is not essential for this function. Evidence is presented that AtHMA4 functions as an efflux pump.

<ABSTRACT>
Selenium (Se)-containing proteins have important roles in protecting cells from oxidative damage. This work investigated the effects of Se-depletion on the expression of the genes encoding selenoproteins in colonic mucosa from rats fed diets of different Se content and in human intestinal Caco-2 cells grown in Se-adequate or Se-depleted culture medium. Se-depletion produced statistically significant (P<0.05) falls in glutathione peroxidase (GPX) 1 mRNA (60-83%) and selenoprotein W mRNA (73%) levels, a small but significant fall in GPX4 mRNA (17-25%) but no significant change in GPX2. The data show that SelW expression in the colon is highly sensitive to Se-depletion.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system exports folded proteins across bacterial cytoplasmic membranes. Recently, genes encoding TatA, TatB and TatC homologues were identified in Streptomyces lividans and the functionality of the Tat pathway was demonstrated. Here, we have examined the localization and structural organization of the Tat components in S. lividans. Interestingly, besides being membrane-associated proteins, S. lividans TatA and TatB were also detected in the cytoplasm. TatC could only be detected in isolated membrane fractions. Whereas all TatC was found to be stably inserted in the membrane, part of membrane-associated TatA and TatB could be extracted following high salt, sodium carbonate or urea treatment suggesting a more loose association with the membrane. Finally, we have analyzed Tat complexes that could be purified from an S. lividans TatABC overproducing strain. From the cytoplasmic membrane, two types of high molecular mass Tat complexes could be isolated having a similar composition as those isolated from Escherichia coli. In the cytoplasm, TatA and TatB were detected as monomer or as homo-oligomeric complexes.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Circadian rhythms are known to exist in all groups of eukaryotic organisms as well as oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria. However, little information is available regarding the existence of rhythmic behaviors in prokaryotes other than cyanobacteria. Here we report biological rhythms of gene expression in a purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides by using a luciferase reporter gene system. Self-bioluminescent strains of Rb. sphaeroides were constructed, which produced a bacterial luciferase and its substrate, a long chain fatty aldehyde, to sustain the luminescence reaction. After being subjected to a temperature or light entrainment regime, the reporter strains with the luciferase genes driven by an upstream endogenous promoter expressed self-sustained rhythmicity in the constant free-running period. The rhythms were controlled by oxygen and exhibited a circadian period of 20.5 h under aerobic conditions and an ultradian period of 10.6-12.7 h under anaerobic conditions. The data suggest a novel endogenous oscillation mechanism in purple photosynthetic bacteria. Elucidation of the clock-like behavior in purple bacteria has implications in understanding the origin and evolution of circadian rhythms.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):813-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
When deleted of its N-terminal signal-reception domain, the broad host range sigma54-dependent transcriptional regulator XylR, along with its cognate promoter Pu, becomes a sensor of the metabolic stress of the carrier bacteria. We have employed a surface reporter system to visualize the physiological status of intracellular Shigella flexneri during infection of Henle 407 cells in culture. To this end, the xylRDeltaA gene has been engineered adjacent to a bicistronic transcriptional fusion of Pu to a lamB variant tagged with a short viral sequence (cor) and beta-galactosidase (lacZ). The accessibility of the cor epitope to the externalmost medium and the expression of Pu in the bacterial population was confirmed, respectively, with immunomagnetic beads and the sorting of Escherichia coli cells treated with a fluorescent antibody. Intracellular Shigella cells expressed the Pu-lamB/cor-lacZ reporter at high levels, suggesting that infectious cells endure a considerable metabolic constraint during the invasion process.

<ABSTRACT>
The gene product of EFHC1 recently implicated in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) was found to be a homolog of Chlamydomonas axonemal protein Rib72, whose homologs are present in a wide variety of organisms that have motile cilia and flagella. Western blot analyses and immunofluorescence localization of the mouse ortholog mRib72-1/Efhc1 indicated that it is indeed abundantly present in sperm flagella and tracheal cilia but only in a small amount in the brain. It is not present in immotile primary cilia. These observations raise the possibility that malfunction of motile cilia is involved in the development of JME.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):823-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase) is a deglycosylating enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the beta-aspartylglycosylamine bond of aspargine-linked glycopeptides and glycoproteins. Earlier studies from our laboratory indicated that PNGase catalyzed de-N-glycosylation was limited to glycopeptide substrates, but recent reports have demonstrated that it also acts upon full-length misfolded glycoproteins. In this study, we utilized two glycoprotein substrates, yeast carboxypeptidase and chicken egg albumin (ovalbumin), to study the deglycosylation activity of yeast PNGase and its mutants. Our results provide further evidence that PNGase acts upon full-length glycoprotein substrates and clearly establish that PNGase acts only on misfolded or denatured glycoproteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Due to their central role in sugar metabolism and signalling plant hexokinases have been studied in great detail, however, little is known about the spatial and temporal expression and the sub-cellular distribution of individual hexokinase isoforms. Based on in planta and in vitro studies the recently isolated tobacco hexokinase 2 (Hxk2) could be located in the chloroplast stroma and biochemically characterized. Hxk2 represents the first innerplastidic hexokinase described from higher plants. Promoter studies indicate that Hxk2 is mainly expressed in cells of the vascular starch sheath and xylem parenchyma, in guard cells and root tips. We propose a role for Hxk2 in starch and secondary metabolism in the mentioned tissues.

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors stimulate osteoclast formation via
TRANCE/RANKL expression in osteoblasts: possible involvement of ERK and
p38 MAPK pathways.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jan 31;579(3):832-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are enzymes that degrade intracellular cAMP. In the present study, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and pentoxifylline, PDE inhibitors, induced osteoclast formation in cocultures of mouse bone marrow cells and calvarial osteoblasts. These inhibitors induced the expression of the osteoclast differentiation factor, TNF-related activation induced cytokine (TRANCE, identical to RANKL, ODF, and OPGL), in calvarial osteoblasts. IBMX induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in osteoblasts. Induction of TRANCE expression by IBMX was partially suppressed by the inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA), ERK, and p38 MAPK, suggesting that activation of ERK and p38 MAPK, as well as PKA, is involved in TRANCE expression by IBMX. Osteoblasts expressed PDE4, a PDE subtype, and rolipram, a selective inhibitor of PDE4, induced TRANCE expression. These results suggest that PDE4 is a key regulator of TRANCE expression in osteoblasts, which in turn controls osteoclast formation.

The impact of blood contamination on the proteome of cerebrospinal fluid.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):290-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is in direct contact with the brain extracellular space. Beside the secretion of CSF by the choroid plexus the fluid also derives directly from the brain by the ependymal lining of the ventricular system and the glial membrane and from blood vessels in the arachnoid. Therefore, biochemical change in the brain may be reflected in the CSF. CSF is a potential source of protein molecular indices of central nervous system function and pathology. However, various amounts of blood contamination in CSF may arise during sample acquisition. The concentration of protein in the CSF is only 0.2 to 0.5% that of blood. Minor contamination of CSF with blood during collection of the fluid may dramatically alter the protein profile confounding the identification of potential biomarkers. We have analyzed CSF and CSF spiked with increasing amounts of whole blood using proteomic techniques. We detected at least four blood specific highly abundant proteins: hemoglobin, catalase, peroxiredoxin and carbonic anhydrase I. These proteins can be used as blood contamination markers for proteomic analysis of CSF. Proteins in blood contaminated CSF samples were less stable compared to neat CSF at 37 degrees C suggesting that blood borne protease may induce protein degradation in CSF during sample acquisition. This analysis was aimed at identification of proteins found primarily in CSF, those found primarily in blood and assessment of the impact of blood contamination on those proteins found in both fluids.

Transcriptomic and proteomic responses of human renal HEK293 cells to
uranium toxicity.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):297-306.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The industrial use of uranium, in particular depleted uranium, has pin-pointed the need to review its chemical impact on human health. Global methodologies, applied to the field of toxicology, have demonstrated their applicability to investigation of fine molecular mechanisms. This report illustrate the power of toxicogenomics to evaluate the involvement of certain genes or proteins in response to uranium. We particularly show that 25% of modulated genes concern signal transduction and trafficking, that the calcium pathway is heavily disturbed and that nephroblastomas-related genes are involved (WIT-1, STMN1, and STMN2). A set of 18 genes was deregulated whatever the concentration of toxicant, which could constitute a signature of uranium exposure. Moreover, a group of downregulated genes, with corresponding disappearing proteins (HSP90, 14-3-3 protein, HMGB1) in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE), are good candidates for use as biomarkers of uranium effects. These results reveal a cross-checking between transcriptomic and proteomic technologies. Moreover, our temporal gene expression profiles suggest the existence of a concentration threshold between adaptive response and severe cell deregulation. Our results confirm the involvement of genes already described and also provide new highlights on cellular response to uranium.

Phosphoprotein profiling of erythropoietin receptor- dependent pathways
using different proteomic strategies.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):91-100.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteomic techniques provide new tools for the global analysis of protein profiles but also for the investigation of specific protein functions. The analysis of signaling cascades has traditionally been performed by the determination of enzymatic or transcription factor activities representing a certain pathway. Functional proteomics now allows more comprehensive approaches to study cellular responses induced during ligand/receptor interactions. In this study we evaluated proteomic strategies for the investigation of structure-function relationships in the erythropoietin receptor signalling complex. After expression of epidermal growth factor/erythropoietin receptor mutant molecules in an identical cellular background we characterized their potential to induce cellular activities. Using this system we focused our efforts on post-translational modifications of signalling proteins reflecting a substantial part of receptor-dependent signaling events. Although tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were enriched by immunoprecipitation the analysis using the classical approach combining two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry revealed that low expressed signaling proteins cannot be detected by this technique. An alternative strategy using one-dimensional gel separation of phosphoproteins and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, however, allowed us to identify multiple proteins involved in intracellular signalling representing already established pathways but also proteins which have not been linked to EPO-induced signaling so far. This approach offers the potential to extend functional proteomic studies to complex signaling processes.

Proteomic analysis of salt stress-responsive proteins in rice root.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):235-44.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Salt stress is one of the major abiotic stresses in agriculture worldwide. We report here a systematic proteomic approach to investigate the salt stress-responsive proteins in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). Three-week-old seedlings were treated with 150 mM NaCl for 24, 48 and 72 h. Total proteins of roots were extracted and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. More than 1100 protein spots were reproducibly detected, including 34 that were up-regulated and 20 down-regulated. Mass spectrometry analysis and database searching helped us to identify 12 spots representing 10 different proteins. Three spots were identified as the same protein, enolase. While four of them were previously confirmed as salt stress-responsive proteins, six are novel ones, i.e. UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6b-1, glutamine synthetase root isozyme, putative nascent polypeptide associated complex alpha chain, putative splicing factor-like protein and putative actin-binding protein. These proteins are involved in regulation of carbohydrate, nitrogen and energy metabolism, reactive oxygen species scavenging, mRNA and protein processing, and cytoskeleton stability. This study gives new insights into salt stress response in rice roots and demonstrates the power of the proteomic approach in plant biology studies.

A comparison of immobilized pH gradient isoelectric focusing and
strong-cation-exchange chromatography as a first dimension in shotgun
proteomics.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):24-34.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Recently, we have developed a high-resolution two-dimensional separation strategy for the analysis of complex peptide mixtures. This methodology employs isoelectric focusing of peptides on immobilized pH gradient (IPG) gels in the first dimension, followed by reversed-phase chromatography in the second dimension, and subsequent tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The traditional approach to this mixture problem employs strong-cation-exchange (SCX) chromatography in the first dimension. Here, we present a direct comparison of these two first-dimensional techniques using complex protein samples derived from the testis of Rattus norvegicus. It was found that the use of immobilized pH gradients (narrow range pH 3.5-4.5) for peptide separation in the first dimension yielded 13% more protein identifications than the optimized off-line SCX approach (employing the entire pI range of the sample). In addition, the IPG technique allows for a much more efficient use on mass spectrometer analysis time. Separation of a tryptic digest derived from a rat testis sample on a narrow range pH gradient (over the 3.5-4.5 pH range) yielded 7626 and 2750 peptides and proteins, respectively. Peptide and protein identification was performed with high confidence using SEQUEST in combination with a data filtering program employing pI and statistical based functions to remove false-positives from the data.

A proteomic approach to characterize protein shedding.

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):123-31.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Shedding (i.e. proteolysis of ectodomains of membrane proteins) plays an important pathophysiological role. In order to study the feasibility of identifying shed proteins, we analyzed serum-free media of human mammary epithelial cells by mass spectrometry following induction of shedding by the phorbol ester, 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Different means of sample preparation, including biotinylation of cell surface proteins, isolation of glycosylated proteins, and preparation of crude protein fractions, were carried out to develop the optimal method of sample processing. The collected proteins were digested with trypsin and analyzed by reversed-phase capillary liquid chromatography interfaced to an ion-trap mass spectrometer. The resulting peptide spectra were interpreted using the program SEQUEST. Analyzing the sample containing the crude protein mixture without chemical modification or separation resulted in the greatest number of identifications, including putatively shed proteins. Overall, 45 membrane-associated proteins were identified including 22 that contain at least one transmembrane domain and 23 that indirectly associate with the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane. Of the 22 transmembrane proteins, 18 were identified by extracellular peptides providing strong evidence they originate from regulated proteolysis or shedding processes. We combined results from the different experiments and used a peptide count method to estimate changes in protein abundance. Using this approach, we identified two proteins, syndecan-4 and hepatoma-derived growth factor, whose abundances increased in media of cells treated with PMA. We also detected proteins whose abundances decreased after PMA treatment such as 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein and lactate dehydrogenase A. Further analysis using immunoblotting validated the abundance changes for syndecan-4 and 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein as a result of PMA treatment. These results demonstrate that tandem mass spectrometry can be used to identify shed proteins and to estimate changes in protein abundance.

Purification and proteomic analysis of outer membrane vesicles from a
clinical isolate of Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):144-52.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The severe pulmonary form of leptospirosis (SPFL) is an especially serious and rapid disease process characterized by alveolar hemorrhage and acute respiratory failure. The outer membrane of Leptospira facilitates direct interactions with the environs and likely contains important constituents involved during infection, transmission, survival, and adaptation to environmental conditions, including putative vaccinogen and diagnostic candidates. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) were purified by incubation in low-pH citrate buffer, treatment in a French press, and centrifugation over a continuous sucrose gradient. OMVs characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) contained the previously described outer membrane proteins OmpL1, Qlp42, LipL32, LipL41, LipL36 and Loa22. In addition, unknown, hypothetical and putative outer membrane proteins were identified. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry and fraction collection (LC-MS+) measured the intact mass profile of the major outer membrane protein, LipL32, and the putative lipoprotein Qlp42. In contrast to a predicted molecularmass of 27,653.5 Da for LipL32 after cleavage of its signal peptide, intact mass proteomics measured the mass as ranging from 28,468 to 28,583 Da, consistent with lipidation of LipL32. In contrast to a predicted molecular mass of 39.8 kDa for Qlp42, the actual mass was measured as 24,811 and 26,461 Da consistent with a 30 kDa doublet observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and processing of the N-terminus of the mature protein. These studies indicate that purified OMVs are highly compatible with proteomics technologies including 2-DE and intact mass proteomics using LC-MS+ that facilitates definition of actual molecular masses of intact outer membrane proteins, and heterogeneity associated with them.

The 30S ribosomal P site: a function of 16S rRNA.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 7;579(4):855-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The 30S ribosomal P site serves several functions in translation. It must specifically bind initiator tRNA during formation of the 30S initiation complex; bind the anticodon stem-loop of peptidyl-tRNA during the elongation phase; and help to maintain the translational reading frame when the A site is unoccupied. Early experiments provided evidence that 16S rRNA was an important component of the 30S P site. Footprinting and crosslinking studies later implicated specific nucleotides in interactions with tRNA. The crystal structures of the 30S subunit and 70S ribosome-tRNA complexes confirmed the interactions between 16S rRNA and tRNA, but also revealed contacts between tRNA and the C-terminal tails of proteins S9 and S13. Deletion of these tails now shows that the 16S rRNA contacts alone are sufficient to support protein synthesis in living cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Members of the Y-family of DNA polymerases catalyze template-dependent DNA synthesis but share no sequence homology with other known DNA polymerases. Y-family polymerases exhibit high error rates and low processivity when copying normal DNA but are able to synthesize DNA opposite damaged templates. In the past three years, much has been learned about this family of polymerases including determination of more than a dozen crystal structures with various substrates. In this short review, I will summarize the biochemical properties and structural features of Y-family DNA polymerases.

Replication of damaged DNA by translesion synthesis in human cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 7;579(4):873-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Most types of DNA damage block the passage of the replication machinery. In order to bypass these blocks, cells employ special translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases, which have lower stringency than replicative polymerases. DNA polymerase eta is the major polymerase responsible for bypassing UV lesions in DNA and its absence results in the variant form of the genetic disorder, xeroderma pigmentosum. Other TLS polymerases have specificities for different types of damage, but their precise roles inside the cell have not yet been established. These polymerases are located in replication factories during DNA replication and the polymerase sliding clamp PCNA plays an important role in mediating switching between different polymerases.

<ABSTRACT>
Prior to the initiation of DNA replication, chromosomes must establish a biochemical mark that permits the recruitment in S phase of the DNA replication machinery that copies DNA. The process of chromosome replication in eukaryotes also must be coordinated with segregation of the duplicated chromosomes to daughter cells during mitosis. Protein complexes that utilize ATP coordinate events at origins of DNA replication and later they participate in the initiation of DNA replication. In eukaryotes, some of these proteins also play a part in later processes that ensure accurate inheritance of chromosomes in mitosis, including spindle attachment of chromosomes, accurate duplication of centrosomes and cytokinesis. A perspective of how ATP-dependent proteins accomplish this task in eukaryotes is discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
The information from genome sequencing provides new approaches for systems-wide understanding of protein networks and cellular function. DNA microarray technologies have advanced to the point where nearly complete monitoring of gene expression is feasible in several organisms. An equally important goal is to comprehensive survey cellular proteomes and profile protein changes under different cellular states. This presents a complex analytical problem, due to the chemical variability between proteins and peptides. Here, we discuss strategies to improve accuracy and sensitivity of peptide identification, distinguish represented protein isoforms, and quantify relative changes in protein abundance.

Towards therapeutic applications of engineered zinc finger proteins.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 7;579(4):892-4.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
It has long been the goal of molecular biologists to design DNA-binding proteins for the specific control of gene expression. The zinc finger design is ideally suited for such purposes, discriminating between closely related sequences both in vitro and in vivo. Whereas other DNA-binding proteins generally make use of the 2-fold symmetry of the double helix, zinc fingers do not and so can be linked linearly in tandem to recognize DNA sequences of different lengths, with high fidelity. This modular design offers a large number of combinatorial possibilities for the specific recognition of DNA. By fusing zinc finger peptides to repression or activation domains, genes can be selectively targeted and switched off and on. Several recent applications of such engineered zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) are described, including the activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a human cell line and an animal model. Clinical trials have recently begun on using VEGF-activating ZFPs to treat human peripheral arterial disease, by stimulating vascular growth. Also in progress are pre-clinical studies using ZFPs to target the defective genes in two monogenic disorders, SCID and SCA. The aim is to replace them in each case by a correct copy from an extrachromosomal DNA donor by means of homologous recombination. Promising results are reported.

<ABSTRACT>
It is now widely recognized that the packaging of genomic DNA, together with core histones, linker histones, and other functional proteins into chromatin profoundly influences nuclear processes such as transcription, replication, DNA repair, and recombination. Whereas earlier structural studies portrayed nucleosomes (the basic repeating unit of chromatin) as monolithic and static macromolecular assemblies, we now know that they are highly dynamic and capable of extensive crosstalk with the cellular machinery. Histone variants have evolved to locally alter chromatin structure, whereas histone chaperones and other cellular factors promote histone exchange and chromatin fluidity. Both of these phenomena likely facilitate interconversion between different chromatin states that show varying degrees of transcriptional activity.

<ABSTRACT>
An RNA polymerase II promoter has been isolated in transcriptionally activated and repressed states. Topological and nuclease digestion analyses have revealed a dynamic equilibrium between nucleosome removal and reassembly upon transcriptional activation, and have further shown that nucleosomes are removed by eviction of histone octamers rather than by sliding. The promoter, once exposed, assembles with RNA polymerase II, general transcription factors, and Mediator in a approximately 3 MDa transcription initiation complex. X-ray crystallography has revealed the structure of RNA polymerase II, in the act of transcription, at atomic resolution. Extension of this analysis has shown how nucleotides undergo selection, polymerization, and eventual release from the transcribing complex. X-ray and electron crystallography have led to a picture of the entire transcription initiation complex, elucidating the mechanisms of promoter recognition, DNA unwinding, abortive initiation, and promoter escape.

<ABSTRACT>
Transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes involves structurally and functionally distinct nuclear RNA polymerases, corresponding general initiation factors, gene-specific (DNA-binding) regulatory factors, and a variety of coregulatory factors that act either through chromatin modifications (e.g. histone acetyltransferases and methyltransferases) or more directly (e.g. Mediator) to facilitate formation and function of the preinitiation complex. Biochemical studies with purified factors and DNA versus recombinant chromatin templates have provided insights into the nature and mechanism of action of these factors, including pathways for their sequential function in chromatin remodeling and preinitiation complex formation/function (transcription) steps and a possible role in facilitating the transition between these steps.

<ABSTRACT>
During protein biosynthesis, a nascent protein is exposed to multiple environments and proteins both inside and outside the ribosome that influence nascent chain folding and trafficking. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between two dyes incorporated into a single nascent chain using aminoacyl-tRNA analogs can directly and selectively monitor changes in nascent chain conformation. This approach recently revealed the existence and functional ramifications of ribosome-mediated folding of nascent membrane proteins inside the ribosome and can be extended to characterize the effects of chaperones and other proteins and ligands on nascent protein folding, interactions, assembly, and avoidance of misfolding and degradation.

Co-translational protein targeting by the signal recognition particle.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 7;579(4):921-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The signal recognition particle (SRP) mediates the co-translational targeting of nascent proteins to the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum membrane, or the bacterial plasma membrane. During this process, two GTPases, one in the SRP and one in the SRP receptor (SR), form a complex in which both proteins reciprocally activate the GTPase reaction of one another. The recent crystal structures of the T. aquaticus SRP.SR complex show that the two GTPases associate via an unusually extensive and highly cooperative interaction surface, and form a composite active site at the interface. GTPase activation proceeds through a unique mechanism, stimulated by both interactions between the twinned GTP molecules across the dimer interface and by conformational rearrangements that position catalytic residues in each active site with respect to the bound substrates. Distinct classes of mutations have been isolated that inhibit specific stages during SRP-SR complex formation and activation, suggesting discrete conformational stages during formation of the active SRP.SR complex. Each stage provides a potential control point in the targeting reaction at which regulation by additional components can be exerted, thus ensuring the binding and release of cargo at the appropriate time.

Imaging of biochemical processes in living cells and organisms is essential for understanding how genes and gene products work together in space and time and in health and disease. Such imaging depends crucially on indicator molecules designed to maximize sensitivity and specificity. These molecules can be entirely synthetic, entirely genetically encoded macromolecules, or hybrid combinations, each approach having its own pros and cons. Recent examples from the author's laboratory include peptides whose uptake into cells is triggered by proteases typical of tumors, monomeric red fluorescent proteins and biarsenical-tetracysteine systems for determining the age and electron-microscopic location of proteins.

Technological advances have made it possible to apply it to ice-embedded biological material (cryotomography), thereby ensuring a close-to-life preservation of the samples. In combination with advanced computational methods, such as molecular identification based on pattern recognition, it is a promising approach to comprehensively map macromolecular architecture inside organelles and cells and to visualize macromolecules at work in their natural environment.

<ABSTRACT>
Aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) is delivered to the ribosome in a ternary complex with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP. The stepwise movement of aa-tRNA from EF-Tu into the ribosomal A site entails a number of intermediates. The ribosome recognizes aa-tRNA through shape discrimination of the codon-anticodon duplex and regulates the rates of GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu and aa-tRNA accommodation in the A site by an induced fit mechanism. Recent results of kinetic measurements, ribosome crystallography, single molecule FRET measurements, and cryo-electron microscopy suggest the mechanism of tRNA recognition and selection.

<ABSTRACT>
The ability to maintain intact ribosomes in the mass spectrometer has enabled research into their changes in conformation and interactions. In the mass spectrometer, it is possible to induce dissociation of proteins from the intact ribosome and, in conjunction with atomic structures, to understand the factors governing their release. We have applied this knowledge to interpret the structural basis for release of proteins from ribosomes for which no high resolution structures are available, such as complexes with elongation factor G and ribosomes from yeast. We also describe how improvements in technology and understanding have widened the scope of our research and lead to dramatic improvements in quality and information available from spectra of intact ribosomes.

<ABSTRACT>
Ribosomes are ribozymes exerting substrate positioning and promoting substrate-mediated catalysis. Peptide-bonds are formed within a symmetrical region, thus suggesting that ribosomes evolved by gene-fusion. Remote interactions dominate substrate positioning at stereochemistry suitable for peptide-bond formation and elaborate architectural-design guides the processivity of the reaction by rotatory motion. Nascent proteins are directed into the exit tunnel at extended conformation, complying with the tunnel's narrow entrance. Tunnel dynamics facilitate its interactive participation in elongation, discrimination, cellular signaling and nascent-protein trafficking into the chaperon-aided folding site. Conformational alterations, induced by ribosomal-recycling factor, facilitate subunit dissociation. Remarkably, although antibiotics discrimination is determined by the identity of a single nucleotide, involved also in resistance, additional nucleotides dictate antibiotics effectiveness.

The atomic structures of the large ribosomal subunit from Haloarcula marismortui and its complexes with substrates and antibiotics have provided insights into the way the 3000 nucleotide 23S rRNA folds into a compact, specific structure and interacts with 27 ribosomal proteins as well as the structural basis of the peptidyl transferase reaction and its inhibition by antibiotics. The structure shows that the ribosome is indeed a ribozyme.

<ABSTRACT>
Translation is the process by which the genetic information contained in mRNA is used to link amino acids in a predetermined sequential order into a polypeptide chain, which then folds into a protein. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are the adapter molecules designed to provide the "lookup" from codons to amino acids. Cryo-EM has provided evidence that the ribosome, as a molecular machine, undergoes many structural changes during translation. Recent findings show that the tRNA structure itself undergoes large conformational changes as well, and that the decoding process must be seen as a complex dynamic interplay between tRNA and the ribosome.

Characterization of heat shock protein 27 phosphorylation sites in renal
cell carcinoma.

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(3):788-95.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) occurs differently in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) compared to homologous normal kidney tissue. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was used to separate and visualize HSP27, via immunostaining with anti-HSP27 antibody, in tumor and normal renal samples, obtained after surgery resection from patients with RCC. The mean number of protein species was 21 in RCC and 15 in normal tissues. Selected spots were in-gel digested with trypsin, extracted and analyzed by microcapillary liquid chromatography (LC) electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry to confirm HSP27 protein identity and reveal phosphorylation sites. Loss of phosphopeptides due to extensive plumbing and/or metal components in automated LC-systems was limited by manual loading of samples directly onto the LC system using a homemade pressure vessel. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed that in three of the HSP27 protein species phosphorylation occurred at Serine 15 and in five at Serine 82 in a different pattern. The phosphorylation of Serine 15 and 82 was also investigated by immunohistochemistry on tissue sections. The data obtained using anti-HSP27Serine82phos-antibody are consistent with MS results, while the variance between results achieved by anti-HSP27Serine15phos-antibody and by MS is probably due to the low specificity of the antibody. Knowledge of the diversity and modulation of HSP27 phosphorylation protein species might represent useful markers involved in the differentiation of RCC.

A proteomic investigation into etoposide chemo-resistance of neuroblastoma
cell lines.

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(3):796-804.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Neuroblastoma, one of the most common pediatric solid tumors, originates from the peripheral sympathetic nervous system and is responsible for approximately 15% of all childhood cancer deaths. Among the several antineoplastic drugs used in neuroblastoma chemotherapeutic protocols, topoisomerase inhibitors (i.e., etoposide) represent the most commonly used. Several resistance mechanisms limit the clinical success of topoisomerase-targeting drugs, mainly reducing the ability of neoplastic cells to start programmed cell death when exposed to antineoplastic drugs. The aim of this study was to determine, by means of proteomics, potential markers of etoposide resistance in human neuroblastoma cell lines as well as to investigate protein levels and modifications possibly involved in the onset of resistance. The etoposide resistant clone showed overexpression of the following proteins: peroxiredoxin 1, beta-galactoside soluble lectin binding protein, vimentin (three protein spots), heat shock 27 kDa protein (two protein spots) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K. In addition, we also found down-regulation of dUTP pyrophosphatase. This investigation might represent a first step towards the development of novel prognostic markers of neuroblastoma chemotherapy.

Changes in the tobacco leaf apoplast proteome in response to salt stress.

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(3):737-45.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The apoplast of plant cells is a dynamic compartment involved in many processes, including maintenance of tissue shape, development, nutrition, signalling, detoxification and defence. In this work we used Nicotiana tabacum plants as a model to investigate changes in the soluble apoplast composition induced in response to salt stress. Apoplastic fluid was extracted from leaves of control plants and plants exposed to salt stress, using a vacuum infiltration procedure. Two-dimension electrophoretic analyses revealed about 150 polypeptide spots in the pH range of 3.0 to 10.0, in independent protein extracts, with a high level of reproducibility between the two sample sets. Quantitative evaluation and statistical analyses of the resolved spots in treated and untreated samples revealed 20 polypeptides whose abundance changed in response to salt stress. Mass spectroscopic peptide separation and sequencing was used to identify polypeptides affected by salt stress. While the levels of some proteins were reduced by salt-treatment, an enhanced accumulation of protein species known to be induced by biotic and abiotic stresses was observed. In particular, two chitinases and a germin-like protein increased significantly and two lipid transfer proteins were expressed entirely de novo. Some apoplastic polypeptides, involved in cell wall modifications during plant development, remained largely unchanged. The significance of these components is discussed in the context of stress responses in plants.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) are typically subdivided into three groups, according to their molecular weights and isoelectric points, namely the B-, C-, and D groups. Enriched B- and C-type LMW-GS fractions extracted from the bread wheat cultivar Chinese Spring were characterized using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) directly interfaced with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and HPLC coupled off-line with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, in order to ascertain the number and relative molecular masses of the components present in each fraction and determine the number of cysteine residues. About 70 components were detected in each of the fractions examined by the combined use of these two techniques, with 18 components common to both fractions. Analysis of the fractions after alkylation with 4-vinylpyridine allowed determination of the number of the cysteines present in about 40 subunits. The proteins detected were tentatively classified based on the relative molecular masses and number of cysteine residues. Cross-contamination was found in both B- and C- fractions, along with the presence of D-type LMW-GS. The two fractions also contained unexpected components, probably lipid transfer proteins and omega-gliadins. The presence of extensive microheterogeneity was suggested by the detection of several co-eluting proteins with minor differences in their molecular masses.

Proteomic analysis of human pleural effusion.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):1062-74.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Pleural effusion, an accumulation of pleural fluid, contains proteins originating from plasma filtrate and, especially when tissues are damaged, parenchymal interstitial spaces of lungs and/or other organs. This report presents data of the first global proteomic analysis of human pleural effusion. A composite sample was prepared by pooling pleural effusions from seven lung adenocarcinoma patients. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis of the composite sample revealed 472 silver-stained spots. 242 selected gel spots were subjected to protein identification by in-gel digestion, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and sequence database search. 44 proteins were identified with higher confidence levels (at least two unique peptide sequences matched), while 161 other proteins were identified at the minimal confidence level (only one unique peptide sequence matched). The data provide fundamental information on the composition of protein contents in human pleural effusion. Among these 44 proteins that were identified with higher confidence levels, 7 proteins, retinoblastoma binding protein 7, synaptic vesicle membrane protein, corticosteroid binding globulin precursor, PR-domain containing protein 11, envelope glycoprotein, MSIP043 protein, and titin have not been reported in plasma and may represent proteins specifically present in pleural effusion. These proteins could have originated from parenchymal interstitial spaces and represent potential candidates of useful biomarkers that could not be readily detected in plasma but in pleural effusion. Retinoblastoma binding protein 7 is of special interest since it may play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation.

Different isoforms and post-translational modifications of human salivary
acidic proline-rich proteins.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(3):805-15.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The human salivary acidic proline-rich proteins (aPRPs) complex was investigated by different chromatographic and mass spectrometric approaches and the main aPRPs, namely PRP-1, PRP-2 and PIF-s (15,515 amu), Db-s (17,632 amu) and Pa (15,462 amu) proteins, were detected. All these isoforms are phosphorylated at Ser-8 and Ser-22 and have a pyroglutamic moiety at the N-terminus. Apart from Pa, all the other aPRPs undergo a proteolytic cleavage at Arg-106 residue (Arg-127 in Db-s protein), that generates the small PC peptide (4371 amu) and PRP-3, PRP-4, PIF-f (11,162 amu) and Db-f (13,280 amu) proteins, all of which were detected. With regard to the Pa protein, the main form detected was the dimeric derivative (Pa 2-mer, 30,922 amu) originated by a disulfide bond involving Cys-103 residue. Besides these known isoforms, several previously undetected aPRP derivatives were found (in minor amounts): (i) the triphosphorylated derivatives of PRP-1/PRP-2/PIF-s and Db-s, showing the additional phosphate group at Ser-17; (ii) the mono-phosphorylated forms at either Ser-22 or Ser-8 of PRP-1/PRP-2/PIF-s, PRP-3/PRP-4/PIF-f, Db-s and Db-f; (iii) a nonphosphorylated form of PRP-3/PRP-4/PIF-f; (iv) the triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated forms of Pa 2-mer. Moreover, minor quantities of PRP-3/PRP-4/PIF-f lacking the C-terminal Arg (11,006 amu), and of Pa 2-mer lacking the C-terminal Gln (30,793 amu) were found. By this approach the different phenotypes of PRH1 locus in 59 different subjects were characterized.

<ABSTRACT>
The CpG motif of bacterial DNA (CpG-DNA) is a potent immunostimulating agent whose mechanism of action is not yet clear. Here, we used both DNA microarray and proteomic approaches to investigate the effects of oligodeoxynucleotides containing the CpG motif (CpG-ODN) on gene transcription and protein expression profiles of CpG-ODN responsive THP-1 cells. Microarray analysis revealed that 2 h stimulation with CpG-ODN up-regulated 50 genes and down-regulated five genes. These genes were identified as being associated with inflammation, antimicrobial defense, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, tumor progression, cell differentiation, proteolysis and metabolism. Longer stimulation (8 h) with CpG-ODN enhanced transcriptional expression of 58 genes. Among these 58 genes, none except one, namely WNTI inducible signaling pathway protein 2, was the same as those induced after 2 h stimulation. Proteomic analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by mass spectrometry identified several proteins up-regulated by CpG-ODN. These proteins included heat shock proteins, modulators of inflammation, metabolic proteins and energy pathway proteins. Comparison of microarray and proteomic expression profiles showed poor correlation. Use of more reliable and sensitive analyses, such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and functional assays, on several genes and proteins, nonetheless, confirmed that there is indeed good correlation between mRNA and protein expression after CpG-ODN treatment. This study also revealed that several anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective related proteins, not previously reported, are activated by CpG-DNA. These findings have extended our knowledge on the activation of cells by CpG-DNA and may contribute to further understanding of mechanisms that link innate immunity with acquired immune response(s).

<ABSTRACT>
The recent availability of the honey-bee Apis mellifera genome and trascriptome of both the female castes, has stimulated new efforts in investigating the protein composition of royal jelly (RJ), its role in caste differentiation and its quality and typicality by a proteomic approach. This study is aimed both to separate and identify proteins of royal jelly and to detect some of them in honey-bee pollen-bread by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and by de novo sequencing. All the identified proteins belonged to the Apis mellifera genome. Apalbumin 1 was also confirmed to be present in honey-bee pollen-bread where the presence of apalbumin 2 was also found. In addition several fragments of apalbumin 1 and apalbumin 3 were also found in RJ. These could be the result of protease activity other than that of serine-protease. This study is a contribution to the description of royal jelly proteome.

Amphoteric, buffering chromatographic beads for proteome prefractionation.
I: theoretical model.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(3):620-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The possibility is reported here of fractionating proteins on amphoteric, buffering resins via ion-exchange chromatography. A given protein's adsorption to a particular amphoteric buffering resin is characterized by a bell-shaped curve in which the maximum protein binding capacity is observed at an optimum pH value lying approximately midway between the isoelectric point values (pI) of the resin and the protein. On either side of this maximum the protein binding capacity declines steadily, reaching zero at the pI of either the protein or exchanger. For instance, on beads of pI equal to 8, four proteins, two acidic (bovine albumin and ovalbumin) and two basic (cytochrome c and lysozyme), exhibit binding curves reaching zero values for the whole set when the exchanger is conditioned at pH 8.0. Away from the pI, and on both sides of the pH scale, the bell-shaped adsorption curves reach a maximum, for each protein, at a pH located at the midpoint between the pI values of each protein and that of the exchanger, and decline steadily to reach zero at the pI value of each protein species. Separation of model proteins using different amphoteric buffering resins of various pI was possible at different pH values according to both the pI of the proteins and of the exchangers. It was also demonstrated, using surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and two dimensional electrophoretic mapping, that separation of an Escherichia coli cell lysate on columns packed with amphoteric buffering resins of different pI and titrated to a particular pH value, delivered two distinctly different fractions, i.e. characteristically composed of, on the one hand, proteins having a pI below the buffer pH (the 'adsorbed' fraction), and on the other, of alkaline proteins possessing a pI above the pH of the buffer (the 'unadsorbed' fraction). This approach represents an attractive addition and/or alternative to the armory of protein pre-fractionation techniques currently employed in proteomics.

Different techniques for urinary protein analysis of normal and lung

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Many components in urine are useful in clinical diagnosis and urinary proteins are known as important components to define many diseases such as proteinuria, kidney, bladder and urinary tract diseases. In this study, we focused on the comparison of different sample preparation methods for isolating urinary proteins prior to protein analysis of pooled healthy and lung cancer patient samples. Selective method was used for preliminary investigation of some putative urinary protein markers. Urine samples were passed first through a gel filtration column (PD-10 desalting column) to remove high salts and subsequently concentrated. Remaining interferences were removed by ultrafiltration or four precipitation methods. The analysis of urinary proteins by high-performance liquid chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed many similarities in profiles among preparation methods and a few profiles were different between normal and lung cancer patients. In contrast, the results of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) showed more distinctly different protein patterns. Our finding showed that the sequential preparation of urinary proteins by gel filtration and ultrafiltration could retain most urinary proteins which demonstrated the highest protein spots on 2-D gels and able to identify preliminary urinary protein markers related to cancer. Although sequential preparation of urine samples by gel filtration and protein precipitation resulted in low amounts of proteins on 2-D gels, high Mr proteins were easily detected. Therefore, there are alternative choices for urine sample preparation for studying the urinary proteome and identifying urinary protein markers important for further preclinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Analysis of O-glycosylation site occupancy in bovine kappa-casein
glycoforms separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):990-1002.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The ability of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) to separate glycoproteins was exploited to separate distinct glycoforms of kappa-casein that differed only in the number of O-glycans that were attached. To determine where the glycans were attached, the individual glycoforms were digested in-gel with pepsin and the released glycopeptides were identified from characteristic sugar ions in the tandem mass spectrometry (MS) spectra. The O-glycosylation sites were identified by tandem MS after replacement of the glycans with ammonia / aminoethanethiol. The results showed that glycans were not randomly distributed among the five potential glycosylation sites in kappa-casein. Rather, glycosylation of the monoglycoform could only be detected at a single site, T152. Similarly the diglycoform appeared to be modified exclusively at T152 and T163, while the triglycoform was modified at T152, T163 and T154. While low levels of glycosylation at other sites cannot be excluded the hierarchy of site occupation between glycoforms was clearly evident and argues for an ordered addition of glycans to the protein. Since all five potential O-glycosylation sites can be glycosylated in vivo, it would appear that certain sites remain latent until other sites are occupied. The determination of glycosylation site occupancy in individual glycoforms separated by 2-DE revealed a distinct pattern of in vivo glycosylation that has not been recognized previously.

Isoelectric beads for proteome pre-fractionation. II: experimental
evaluation in a multicompartment electrolyzer.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(3):629-38.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteome pre-fractionation in multicompartment electrolyzers is proposed here, with substantial modifications as compared to the standard technique. First of all, the classical isoelectric, buffering membranes, delimiting each compartment and acting, in pairs, as isoelectric traps, have been replaced by isoelectric buffering beads, operating on the same principle, but allowing unhindered migration of proteins (lack of sieving properties, contrary to typical continuous membrane barriers). Secondly, the isoelectric beads are not made in the conventional manner, with ionic acrylamide derivative monomers throughout their central core, but are composed of a hard, ceramic core, coated with an amphoteric buffering polymer. This minimizes mass transfer resistance of proteins that are transiently adsorbed onto the beads. As a result, significantly reduced separation times, of the order of ca. 3 h, are required for developing steady-state patterns, as compared to the lengthy times (overnight and much longer) in conventional multicompartment electrolyzers operating with isoelectric membranes. Examples of separation of standard marker proteins, as well as entire Escherichia coli lysates and human serum proteins, are given. The obtained fractions are analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.

Automatic annotation of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
N-glycan spectra.

Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):865-75.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is the pre-eminent technique for mass mapping of glycans. In order to make this technique practical for high-throughput screening, reliable automatic methods of annotating peaks must be devised. We describe an algorithm called Cartoonist that labels peaks in MALDI spectra of permethylated N-glycans with cartoons which represent the most plausible glycans consistent with the peak masses and the types of glycans being analyzed. There are three main parts to Cartoonist. (i) It selects annotations from a library of biosynthetically plausible cartoons. The library we currently use has about 2800 cartoons, but was constructed using only about 300 archetype cartoons entered by hand. (ii) It determines the precision and calibration of the machine used to generate the spectrum. It does this automatically based on the spectrum itself. (iii) It assigns a confidence score to each annotation. In particular, rather than making a binary yes/no decision when annotating a peak, it makes all plausible annotations and associates them with scores indicating the probability that they are correct.

An efficient proteomics based strategy for the functional characterization
of a novel halophilic enzyme from Halobacterium salinarum.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):907-17.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The extremely halophilic archaeon, Halobacterium salinarum grows in environments containing over 25% NaCl. The enzymes of this organism have thus been adapted to be active and stable in hypersaline conditions, which makes them strong candidates as robust industrial enzymes. In this study, the proteomics approach was applied to screen novel halophilic enzymes. We focused initially on proteins that are differentially expressed under different salt concentrations in culture media. After two-dimensional gel electrophoresis over a pH 3.5-4.5 range, 29 differentially expressed protein spots were identified by tandem mass spectrometry and six of these had no similarity to preexisting genes of known function. To predict the function of them, we used various bioinformatic methods. Among other proteins, we selected Vng0487h, which showed a high similarity to acetyltransferases. As a step toward assaying the enzymatic activity of this protein, we cloned the Vng0487h gene of H. salinarum and expressed and purified the recombinant protein with a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) tag in Escherichia coli. Using a GST-pulldown assay, a protein fragment derived from E. coli could interact with recombinant Vng0487h, and was identified to be the ribosomal protein L3. This protein showed high sequence homology with ribosomal protein L7/12 from E. coli and ribosomal protein L13p from H. salinarum. This suggests that Vng0487h acetylates a subunit of ribosomal protein, possibly L13p, in H. salinarum. During the present study, an efficient procedure was established to screen novel halophilic enzymes, and to predict and assess their functions.

<ABSTRACT>
In the post-genomics era there has been an acceleration of understanding of cellular and organismal biology and this acceleration has moved the goalposts for proteomics. Higher eukaryotes use alternative promoters, alternative splicing, RNA editing and post-translational modification to produce multiple isoforms of proteins from single genes. Switching amongst these isoforms is a major mechanism for control of cellular function. At present fundamental limitations in sensitivity, in absolute quantitation of proteins and in the characterization of protein structure at functionally important levels strongly limit the applicability of proteomics to higher eukaryotes. Recent developments suggest that quantitative, top-down proteomics analyses of complete proteins at sub-attomole levels are necessary for physiologically relevant studies of higher eukaryotes. New proteomics technologies which will ensure the future of proteomics as an important technology in medicine and cellular biology of higher eukaryotes are becoming available.

<ABSTRACT>
Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) combined with mass spectrometry has significantly improved the possibilities of large-scale identification of proteins. However, 2-DE is limited by its inability to speed up the in-gel digestion process. We have developed a new approach to speed up the protein identification process utilizing microwave technology. Proteins excised from gels are subjected to in-gel digestion with endoprotease trypsin by microwave irradiation, which rapidly produces peptide fragments. The peptide fragments were further analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization technique for protein identification. The efficacy of this technique for protein mapping was demonstrated by the mass spectral analyses of the peptide fragmentation of several proteins, including lysozyme, albumin, conalbumin, and ribonuclease A. The method reduced the required time for in-gel digestion of proteins from 16 hours to as little as five minutes. This new application of microwave technology to protein identification will be an important advancement in biotechnology and proteome research.

<ABSTRACT>
Primary hepatolithiasis or intrahepatic calculi (IHC), which is characterized by the formation of gallstones in the intrahepatic bile duct, is an intractable liver disease and suspected to be one of the causes of cholangiocellular carcinoma. To obtain an insight into the disease, we performed proteomic analysis of liver tissue specimens of paired affected and unaffected hepatic segments from patients with primary hepatolithiasis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by identification of proteins. For the specimens from the unaffected segments, 125 spots out of 613 spots were identified, defining 83 unique protein names. For the specimens from the affected segments, 102 spots out of 671 spots were identified, defining 74 unique protein names. To further precisely compare, we used two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis. Consequently we identified 12 up-regulated proteins and 21 down-regulated proteins. The up-regulated proteins contained the proteins related to liver fibrosis and to cellular oxidoreduction. The down-regulated proteins contained RAF kinase inhibitor protein, chaperonin and proteins related to principal liver function.

Subnanoliter enzymatic assays on microarrays.

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(2):420-5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Many areas of research today are based on enzymatic assays most of which are still performed as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in microtiter plates. The demand for highly parallel screening of thousands of samples eventually led to a miniaturization and automation of these assays. However, the final transfer of enzymatic assays from a microtiter-based technology to microarrays has proven to be difficult for various reasons, such as the inability to maintain unbound reaction products on the spot of reaction or the missing capability of multiplexing. Here, we have conducted multiplex enzymatic assays in subnanoliter volumes on a single microarray using the multiple spotting technology. We were able to measure enzymatic activity with a sensitivity down to 35 enzyme molecules, applying only conventional flat microarray surfaces and standard microarray hardware. We have performed assays of inhibition and applied this format for the detection of prognostic markers, such as cathepsin D. The new approach allows the rapid and multiplex screening of thousands of samples on a single microarray with applications in drug screening, metagenomics, and high-throughput enzyme assays.

<ABSTRACT>
To identify proteins involved in the processes of cellular and molecular response to radiation damage repair in intestinal epithelial IEC-6 cells, we comparatively analyzed the proteome of irradiated IEC-6 cells with that of normal cells. A series of methods were used, including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Z-DE), PDQuest software analysis of 2-DE gels, peptide mass fingerprinting based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), and Swiss-Prot database searching, to separate and identify differentially expressed proteins. Western blotting and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to validate the differentially expressed proteins. Image analysis revealed that averages of 608 +/- 39 and 595 +/- 31 protein spots were detected in normal and irradiated IEC-6 cells, respectively. Sixteen differential protein spots were isolated from gels, and measured with MALDI-TOF-MS. A total of 14 spots yielded good spectra, and 11 spots matched with known proteins after database searching. These proteins were mainly involved in anti-oxidation, metabolism, and protein post-translational processes. Western blotting confirmed that stress-70 protein was down-regulated by gamma-irradiation. Up-regulation of ERP29 was confirmed by RT-PCR, indicating that it is involved in ionizing radiation. The clues provided by the comparative proteome strategy utilized here will shed light on molecular mechanisms of radiation damage repair in intestinal epithelial cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Identification of differentially expressed proteins between the male and female worm of Schistosoma japonicum may provide new insights into the development of schistosomes, especially the molecular mechanism of female worm maturation induced by the male worm after pairing. Comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry were employed to separate and identify differentially expressed proteins between the male and female worm after pairing. Soluble and hydrophobic proteins from egg, schistosomulum (14 days), and female and male worms at adult stage (42 days) were separated by a sequential extraction method followed by 2-DE and 2-DE images were constructed. There were 1016 +/- 67, 1808 +/- 89, 1142 +/- 45 and 1288 +/- 32 spots detected for soluble proteins and 1425 +/- 108, 952 +/- 59, 847 +/- 75 and 965 +/- 69 spots for hydrophobic proteins from egg, schistosomulum, and adult stage female and male worms, respectively. The differentially and uniquely expressed proteins from male and female worms after pairing (42 days) include 41 +/- 4 and 23 +/- 2 unique spots for soluble proteins, and 11 +/- 1 and 26 +/- 3 unique spots for hydrophobic proteins, respectively. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry were employed to analyze 12 unique spots from the female worm and 16 unique spots from the male worm for peptide mass fingerprinting and sequencing. The results showed that the main functions of these differentially expressed proteins were in signal transduction, metabolism and transcriptional regulation etc. Comparison of the schistosomes proteome between male and female worms may permit the identification of protein candidates for the development of vaccines or new targets for drug development against schistosomiasis.

<ABSTRACT>
The increasing volume of proteomics data currently being generated by increasingly high-throughput methodologies has led to an increasing need for methods by which such data can be accurately described, stored and exchanged between experimental researchers and data repositories. Work by the Proteomics Standards Initiative of the Human Proteome Organisation has laid the foundation for the development of standards by which experimental design can be described and data exchange facilitated. The progress of these efforts, and the direct benefits already accruing from them, were described at a plenary session of the 3(rd) Annual HUPO congress. Parallel sessions allowed the three work groups to present their progress to interested parties and to collect feedback from groups already implementing the available formats.

Proteomic and transcriptomic characterization of interferon-alpha-induced
human primary T helper cells.

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(2):371-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is a multifunctional cytokine that modulates immune response. In spite of the numerous comprehensive studies on the effects of IFN-alpha on various cell types, novel characteristics of this versatile agent emerge continuously. In the present study a differential proteomic approach was used to identify new IFN-alpha-regulated proteins in human primary CD4(+) T cells. Two IFN-alpha-inducible proteins, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein alpha (alpha-SNAP) and cleavage stimulation factor-64 (CstF-64) previously not described in this context, were identified. Additionally, several proteins already known as IFN-stimulated genes were observed. The results of proteomics experiments were further studied at the mRNA level using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Both peripheral blood and cord blood CD4(+) T cells were used in order to see if there are differences in IFN-alpha response between these populations. Differences were observed between the IFN-alpha-induced expression kinetics in peripheral blood and cord blood transcripts. The induction was more rapid in peripheral blood than in cord blood cells. CstF-64 expression was upregulated by IFN-alpha at the protein, but not at the mRNA level.

A redox switch hypothesis for the origin of two light reactions in

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 14;579(5):963-8. Epub 2005 Jan 21.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Photosynthesis provides energy in the Earth's biosphere and oxygen in its atmosphere. For oxygen to be produced, two different light reactions must operate simultaneously and in series. Known anaerobic, photosynthetic bacteria contain one or other of these photosystems, but never both. Here, I propose that the two photosystems diverged, in structure and function, from a common ancestor, within a single, continuous, anaerobic lineage. In such cells, living examples of which are predicted, the two photosystems are isoenzymes encoded by orthologous genes under co-ordinated, redox regulatory control. A redox switch responds to defined environmental conditions and selects which set of genes is expressed. In these cells, the two photosystems are thus synthesised at different times. It is further proposed that the origin of oxygen-evolving photosynthesis was a simple mutation that disabled the redox switch, permitting simultaneous expression of the two sets of genes. The two, newly co-existing photosystems became connected by shared electron carriers, allowing generation of electrochemical potential high enough to oxidise water; an inexhaustible supply of reductant; and the selective advantages and pressures of an aerobic world.

The tRNA aminoacylation co-factor Arc1p is excluded from the nucleus by an

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 14;579(5):969-75. Epub 2005 Jan 18.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Arc1p, a yeast tRNA-binding protein, forms a complex with the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, methionyl tRNA synthetase (MetRS) and glutamyl tRNA synthetase (GluRS). Although this complex localizes normally in the cytoplasm, in the absence of Arc1p the two free synthetases are also found inside the nucleus. In this work, in order to localize free Arc1 we abolished complex assembly by deleting the appended domains from both MetRS and GluRS. Surprisingly, free Arc1p remained cytoplasmic even when fitted with a strong nuclear localization signal (NLS). However, NLS-Arc1p accumulated in the nucleus when Xpo1/Crm1, the export receptor for NES-containing cargo proteins, was mutated. Thus, the cytoplasmic location of Arc1p is maintained by Xpo1p-dependent nuclear export and Arc1p could act as an adapter in the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of tRNA and/or the tRNA-aminoacylation machinery.

N-terminal peptide of Rhizopus oryzae lipase is important for its
catalytic properties.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 14;579(5):976-82. Epub 2005 Jan 13.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In a culture medium, the Rhizopus oryzae strain produces only one form of lipase, ROL32. When the concentrated culture medium was stored at 0 degrees C during several months or kept at 6 degrees C during a few days, we noticed the appearance of a second shorter form of ROL32 lacking its N-terminal 28 amino acid (ROL29). ROL29 was purified to homogeneity and its 21 N-terminal amino acid residues were found to be identical to the 29-49 sequence of ROL32. The cleavage of the N-terminal peptide reduced the specific activity of ROL29 by 50% using either triolein or tributyrin as substrates. In order to explain this decrease of the specific activity of ROL29, we measured its critical surface pressure of penetration into phosphatidyl choline from egg yolk films which was found to be 10 mN/m, in contrast to a value of 23 mN/m found in ROL32. A kinetic study on the surface pressure dependency, stereoselectivity and regioselectivity of ROL29 was performed using the three dicaprin isomers spread as monomolecular films at the air-water interface. Our results showed that in contrast to ROL32, ROL29 presented a preference for the distal ester groups of one diglyceride isomer (1,3-sn-dicaprin). Furthermore, ROL32 was markedly more stereoselective than ROL29 for the sn-3 position of the 2,3-sn-enantiomer of dicaprin. A structural explanation of the enhanced penetration capacity as well as the catalytic activity of ROL32 was proposed by molecular modeling. We concluded that the N-terminal peptide of ROL32 can play an important role in the specific activity, the regioselectivity, the stereoselectivity and the binding of the enzyme to its substrate.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The higher plant ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) is a heterotetramer consisting of two regulatory large subunits (LSs) and two catalytic small subunits (SSs). To further characterize the roles of these subunits in determining enzyme function, different combinations of wildtype LS (LWT) and variant forms (LUpReg1, LM345) were co-expressed with wildtype SS (SWT) and variant forms (STG-15 and Sdevo330) and their enzyme properties compared to those measured for the heterotetrameric wildtype enzyme and SS homotetrameric enzymes. Analysis of the allosteric regulatory properties of the various enzymes indicates that although the LS is required for optimal activation by 3-phosphoglyceric acid and resistance to Pi, the overall allosteric regulatory and kinetic properties are specified by both subunits. Our results show that the regulatory and kinetic properties of AGPase are not simply due to the LS modulating the properties of the SS but, instead, are a product of synergistic interaction between the two subunits.

<ABSTRACT>
NDRG1 is phosphorylated by SGK1 (but not PKB) in vivo at three residues each contained within three nonapeptide repeats. Here, we demonstrate that this nonapeptide, like the NDRG1 protein, is phosphorylated by SGK1, but not by PKBalpha or RSK1 in vitro. The inability of PKBalpha and RSK1 to phosphorylate the nonapeptide was traced to residues n+1, n+2 and n-4 (where n is the phosphorylation site). Changing them from Ser, Glu and Ser to Phe, Ala and Pro, respectively, transformed the nonapeptide into an excellent substrate for PKBalpha and RSK1. Our results identify a specific substrate for SGK1 and may facilitate detection of additional physiological substrates for this enzyme.

<ABSTRACT>
The influence in vivo of mutated forms of translation initiation factor (IF1) on the expression of the lacZ or 3A' reporter genes, with different initiation and/or +2 codons, has been investigated. Reporter gene expression in these infA(IF1) mutants is similar to the wild-type strain. The results do not support the longstanding hypothesis that IF1 could perform discriminatory functions while blocking the aminoacyl-tRNA acceptor site (A-site) of the ribosome. One cold-sensitive IF1 mutant shows a general overexpression, in particular at low temperatures, of both reporter genes at the protein but not mRNA level.

<ABSTRACT>
The bioluminescence spectra from the Ca2+-regulated photoproteins aequorin (lambdamax=469 nm) and obelin (lambdamax=482 nm) differ because aequorin has an H-bond from its Tyr82 to the bound coelenteramide, not present in obelin at the corresponding Phe88. Substitutions of this Phe88 by Tyr, Trp, or His shifted the obelin bioluminescence to shorter wavelength with F88Y having lambdamax=453 nm. Removal of the H-bond by the substitution of Y82F in aequorin shifted its bioluminescence to lambdamax=501 nm. All mutants were stable with good activity and were expressible in mammalian cells, thereby demonstrating potential for monitoring multiple events in cells using multi-color detection.

<ABSTRACT>
A new subtype of archaeal Rieske ferredoxin (RFd) has been identified in the genome of the thermoacidophilic archaeon Acidianus ambivalens. The gene is inserted in an atypical genomic context in a gene cluster encoding a NiFe hydrogenase. Sequence and phyletic analysis showed that the protein is related to bacterial RFd but not to any of the known archaeal Rieske proteins. The recombinant 14 kDa protein isolated from Escherichia coli behaved as a dimer in solution. It contained approximately 2 Fe/mol and all visible and EPR spectroscopic features typical of Rieske centre-containing proteins. However, its redox potential (+170 mV) was significantly higher than those of canonical RFd. This difference is rationalized in terms of the protein structure environment, as discrete amino acid substitutions in key positions around the metal centre account for the higher potential.

<ABSTRACT>
Telomerase activation is regulated by the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and is a key step in the development of human cancers. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signaling induces growth arrest in many tumors through multiple regulatory mechanisms. The p27 tumor suppressor protein inhibits the formation of tumors through the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. We demonstrate here that p27Kip1 inhibits hTERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity through post-transcriptional up-regulation by IFN-gamma/IRF-1 signaling. The ectopic expression of p27 suppressed hTERT expression and telomerase activity in human cervical cancer cell lines, HeLa and HT3. Furthermore, hTERT promoter activity of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in p27 (p27-/- MEFs) was significantly higher than that of wild-type MEFs. Overexpression of p27 suppressed hTERT promoter activity and telomerase activity of p27-/- MEFs. In addition p27 down-regulated E7 protein expression and in transiently transfected HeLa cells, E7 increased hTERT promoter activity. In conclusion, we propose that inhibition of the hTERT expression and telomerase activity may be a novel tumor suppressor function of p27.

<ABSTRACT>
Rat cytosolic sialidase is expressed at elevated levels in skeletal muscle and is believed to play a role in the myogenic differentiation of muscle cells. Here, we observed varying levels of enhancement of sialidase activity in the presence a range of divalent cations. In particular, a significant enhancement of activity was observed in the presence of Ca2+. Conversely, inhibition of the sialidase activity was found when the enzyme was incubated in the presence of Cu2+, EDTA, and a range of carbohydrate-based inhibitors. Finally, an investigation of the enzymatic hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-alpha-D-neuraminide, by 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed that the reaction catalysed by rat skeletal muscle cytosolic sialidase proceeds with overall retention of anomeric configuration. This result further supports the notion that all sialidases appear to be retaining enzymes.

<ABSTRACT>
Jab1 interacts with a variety of cell cycle and signal transduction regulators to control cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis. In this study, we employed a non-denaturing gel electrophoresis method to separate different Jab1-containing complexes, the COP9 signalosome complex and the small Jab1-containing subcomplex. The formation of the small Jab1 complex was dependent on a low cell density and anchorage to a solid support, and enhanced during the early G1 phase of the cell cycle, which was abrogated in ras-transformed cells. The small Jab1-containing subcomplex may be a novel mediator of anchorage and cell-cell contact-dependent signal transduction.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 14;579(5):1055-60.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Transections of the entorhinal afferent fibers to hippocampus, perforant path (PP), result in the denervation in specific hippocampal subregions, which is followed by a series of plastic events including axon sprouting and reactive synaptogenesis. Many growth-associated molecules are thought to participate in these events. In the present study, we proved the upregulation of ephrin-A2 in the denervated areas of the ipsilateral hippocampus following PP transections. Interestingly, when the elevation of ephrin-A2 reached the maximum axon sprouting in the denervated areas almost finished, implying the possible inhibitory effect of ephrin-A2 on sprouting. In addition, ephrin-A2 expression was observed in synapses during reactive synaptogenesis, suggesting that this molecule might also be implicated in the formation and maturation of synapses in the denervated areas.

<ABSTRACT>
Haem controls its own synthesis in non-erythroid cells primarily by regulation of ALAS1 mRNA stability. Alternative splicing of human ALAS1 generates two mRNAs with different 5'-UTRs: a major one, where exon 1B is omitted, and a minor form containing exon 1B. We show that, unlike the major ALAS1 mRNA, the minor form was resistant to haem-mediated decay. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ALAS1 5'-UTR alone did not confer haem-mediated decay upon a heterologous mRNA and the inclusion of exon 1B inhibited translation. These data suggest that translation of ALAS1 mRNA itself might be required for destabilisation in response to haem.

The protein has a light, oxygen and voltage (LOV)-sensing domain binding a flavin mononucleotide. The photo-activation of the domain is an indispensable step to initiate the cellular signaling for flowering. In the present study, a LOV-containing polypeptide of FKF1 was prepared by an overexpression system, and the quaternary structure of it was studied by size exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering. The apparent molecular weight from chromatography suggested a globular trimeric or an anisotropic-shaped dimeric association of the polypeptide in solution. The scattering experiment demonstrated a dimeric association of the polypeptides with an elongated molecular shape displaying the radius of gyration of 27 A and the maximum dimension of 94 A. The molecular shape simulated from scattering profiles suggests an antiparallel association of the LOV domains in the dimer. Though the absorption spectrum of blue-light irradiated polypeptide was stable in the photoactivated state for a long period, the scattering profiles showed very small changes between the dark and light conditions. Based on the homologies in the amino-acid sequences and the scattering profiles, these results are discussed in connection with the structures and function of LOV domains of phototropin.

<ABSTRACT>
Import of tRNAs into plant mitochondria appears to be highly specific. We recently showed that the anticodon and the D-domain sequences are essential determinants for tRNAVal import into tobacco cell mitochondria. To determine the minimal set of elements required to direct import of a cytosol-specific tRNA species, tobacco cells were transformed with an Arabidopsis thaliana intron-containing tRNAMet-e gene carrying the D-domain and the anticodon of a valine tRNA. Although well expressed and processed into tobacco cells, this mutated tRNA was shown to remain in the cytosol. Furthermore, a mutant tRNAVal carrying the T-domain of the tRNAMet-e, although still efficiently recognized by the valyl-tRNA synthetase, is not imported into mitochondria. Altogether these results suggest that mutations affecting the core of a tRNA molecule also alter its import ability into plant mitochondria.

alpha7B integrin changes in mdx mouse muscles after L-arginine
administration.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 14;579(5):1079-84.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Muscle fibers attach to laminin in the basal lamina using two mechanisms, i.e., dystrophin with its associated proteins and alpha7beta1 integrin. In humans, gene-mutation defects in one member of these complexes result in muscular dystrophies. This study revealed changes after L-arginine treatment of utrophin-associated proteins and the alpha7B integrin subunit in mdx mouse, a dystrophin-deficient animal model. In the two studied muscles (cardiac muscle and diaphragm), the alpha7B integrin subunit was increased in 5-week-old treated mice. Interestingly, the diaphragm histopathological appearance was significantly improved by L-arginine administration. These results highlight a possible way to compensate for dystrophin deficiency via alpha7beta1 integrin.

<ABSTRACT>
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide (GLP-1) is the most potent physiological insulinotropic hormone in humans. We produced large amounts of a GLP-1 analogue, [Ser8, Gln26, Asp34]-GLP-1, which is resistant to trypsin-digestion, as part of a chimeric rice seed storage protein, a 26 kDa globulin, in genetically modified rice seeds. Junction sites between GLP-1 analogue and globulin were replaced by tryptic cleavage sites. The highest level of GLP-1 analogue accumulation was approximately 20-50 microg per seed. We found that GLP-1 analogue derived from trypsin-digested genetically modified rice seeds stimulated insulin secretion from a mouse pancreatic beta-cell line, MIN6.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Using high-density oligonucleotide array, we comprehensively analyzed expression levels of 12600 genes in 50 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples with positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) serology (well (G1), moderately (G2), and poorly (G3) differentiated tumors) and 11 non-tumorous livers (L1 and L0) with and without HCV infection. We searched for discriminatory genes of transition (L0 vs. L1, L1 vs. G1, G1 vs. G2, G2 vs. G3) with a supervised learning method, and then arranged the samples by self-organizing map (SOM) with the discriminatory gene sets. The SOM arranged the five clusters on a unique sigmoidal curve in the order L0, L1, G1, G2, and G3. The sample arrangement reproduced development-related features of HCC such as p53 abnormality. Strikingly, G2 tumors without venous invasion were located closer to the G1 cluster, and most G2 tumors with venous invasion were located closer to the G3 cluster (P=0.001 by Fisher's exact test). Our present profiling data will serve as a framework to understand the relation between the development and dedifferentiation of HCC.

<ABSTRACT>
Systems biology efforts are increasingly adopting quantitative, mechanistic modeling to study cellular signal transduction pathways and other networks. However, it is uncertain whether the particular set of kinetic parameter values of the model closely approximates the corresponding biological system. We propose that the parameters be assigned statistical distributions that reflect the degree of uncertainty for a comprehensive simulation analysis. From this analysis, we globally identify the key components and steps in signal transduction networks at a systems level. We investigated a recent mathematical model of interferon gamma induced Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway by applying multi-parametric sensitivity analysis that is based on simultaneous variation of the parameter values. We find that suppressor of cytokine signaling-1, nuclear phosphatases, cytoplasmic STAT1, and the corresponding reaction steps are sensitive perturbation points of this pathway.

<ABSTRACT>
Mitochondrial morphology is controlled by large GTPases, such as Msp1p, whose action on mitochondrial membranes is not yet understood. The sub-mitochondrial localization of Msp1p, the subject of ongoing controversies, was found to be within the intermembrane space. Overexpression of Msp1p led to aggregation of the mitochondrial network, while its downregulation resulted in fragmentation of this network. Mutations affecting the integrity of the Msp1p GTPase function had a dominant phenotype and induced mitochondrial fragmentation followed by mitochondrial DNA loss and cell death. These effects were not observed in cells deleted for Dnm1p, an actor in mitochondrial fission, suggesting that Msp1p is involved in the fusion of mitochondria.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Copper delivery to Ccc2--the Golgi Cu+-ATPase--was investigated in vivo, replacing the Cu+-chaperone Atx1 by various structural homologues in an atx1-Delta yeast strain. Various proteins, displaying the same ferredoxin-like fold and (M/L)(T/S)CXXC metal-binding motif as Atx1 and known as Cu+-, Cd2+- or Hg2+-binding proteins were able to replace Atx1. Therefore, regardless of their original function, these proteins could all bind copper and transfer it to Ccc2, suggesting that Ccc2 is opportunistic and can interact with many different proteins to gain Cu+. The possible role of electrostatic potential surfaces in the docking of Ccc2 with these Atx1-homologues is discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
Bacterial fructosyltransferase enzymes belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 68 (GH68) are not known to require a metal cofactor. Here, we show that Ca2+ ions play an important structural role in the Lactobacillus reuteri 121 levansucrase (Lev) and inulosucrase (Inu) enzymes. Analysis of the Bacillus subtilis Lev 3D structure [Meng, G. and Futterer, K. (2003) Nat. Struct. Biol. 10, 935-941] has provided evidence for the presence of a bound metal ion, most likely Ca2+. Characterization of site-directed mutants in the putative Ca2+ ion-binding sites of Lb. reuteri Lev and Inu revealed that the Inu Asp520 and Lev Asp500 residues play an important role in Ca2+ binding. Sequence alignments of family GH68 proteins showed that this Ca2+ ion-binding site is (largely) present only in proteins of Gram-positive origin.

<ABSTRACT>
The mobilization of sulfur (SUF) system is one of three systems involved in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and maintenance. In eukaryotes the SUF system is specific for the plastid and therefore of symbiotic origin. Analyses in cryptophytes showed a unique genetic compartmentalization of the SUF system, which evolved by at least two different gene transfer events. We analyzed one of the components, SufD, in the cryptophyte Guillardia theta and in Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrated that SufD fulfils house keeping functions during embryogenesis and in adult plants in A. thaliana.

<ABSTRACT>
The serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT4) receptor is of potential interest for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease because it increases memory and learning. In this study, we investigated the effect of zinc metalloprotease inhibitors on the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing induced by the serotonin 5-HT4 receptor in vitro. We show that secretion of the non-amyloidogenic form of APP, sAPPalpha induced by the 5-HT4(e) receptor isoform was not due to a general boost of the constitutive secretory pathway but rather to its specific effect on alpha-secretase activity. Although the h5-HT4(e) receptor increased IP3 production, inhibition of PKC did not modify its effect on sAPPalpha secretion. In addition, we found that alpha secretase activity is regulated by the cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Epac and the small GTPase Rac.

Neutron diffraction reveals sequence-specific membrane insertion of
pre-fibrillar islet amyloid polypeptide and inhibition by rifampicin.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 14;579(5):1143-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) forms amyloid deposits in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Pre-fibrillar hIAPP oligomers (in contrast to monomeric IAPP or mature fibrils) increase membrane permeability, suggesting an important role in the disease. In the first structural study of membrane-associated hIAPP, lamellar neutron diffraction shows that oligomeric hIAPP inserts into phospholipid bilayers, and extends across the membrane. Rifampicin, which inhibits hIAPP-induced membrane permeabilisation in functional studies, prevents membrane insertion. In contrast, rat IAPP (84% identical to hIAPP, but non-amyloidogenic) does not insert into bilayers. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that membrane-active pre-fibrillar hIAPP oligomers insert into beta cell membranes in NIDDM.

<ABSTRACT>
CLC chloride channels are a family of channel proteins mediating chloride transport across the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes. The single yeast CLC protein Gef1p is localized to the Golgi and endosomal system. Investigating epitope-tagged variants of Gef1p, we found that the channel is proteolytically processed in the secretory pathway. Proteolytic cleavage occurs in the first extracellular loop of the protein at residues KR136/137 and is carried out by the Kex2p protease. Fragments mimicking the N- and C-terminal products of the cleavage reaction are non-functional when expressed alone. However, functional channels can assemble when the two fragments are co-expressed.

<ABSTRACT>
The X-ray structure of the ligand-binding core of the kainate receptor GluR5 (GluR5-S1S2) in complex with (S)-glutamate was determined to 1.95 A resolution. The overall GluR5-S1S2 structure comprises two domains and is similar to the related AMPA receptor GluR2-S1S2J. (S)-glutamate binds as in GluR2-S1S2J. Distinct features are observed for Ser741, which stabilizes a highly coordinated network of water molecules and forms an interdomain bridge. The GluR5 complex exhibits a high degree of domain closure (26 degrees) relative to apo GluR2-S1S2J. In addition, GluR5-S1S2 forms a novel dimer interface with a different arrangement of the two protomers compared to GluR2-S1S2J.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 14;579(5):1161-6.

<ABSTRACT>
The recently described Spred protein family has been implicated in the modulation of receptor tyrosine kinase signalling. We report the crystal structure of the Enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology-1 (EVH1) domain from Xenopus tropicalis Spred1, solved to 1.15 A resolution. This structure confirms that the Spred EVH1 adopts the pleckstrin-homology fold, with a similar secondary structure to Enabled. A translation of one of the peptide-binding groove beta-strands narrows this groove, whilst one end of the groove shows structural flexibility. We propose that Spred1 will bind peptides that are less proline-rich than other EVH1 domains, with conformational changes indicating an induced fit.

<ABSTRACT>
Arabidopsis thaliana plants with mutations in the genes encoding eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF4E) or isoform of eIF4E (eIF(iso)4E) were tested for susceptibility to Clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV), a member of the genus Potyvirus. ClYVV accumulated in both inoculated and upper uninoculated leaves of mutant plants lacking eIF(iso)4E, but not in mutant plants lacking eIF4E. In contrast, Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), another member of the genus Potyvirus, multiplied in mutant plants lacking eIF4E but not in mutant plants lacking eIF(iso)4E. These results suggest the selective involvement of members of the eIF4E family in infection by potyviruses.

<ABSTRACT>
EstA is an outer membrane-anchored esterase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An inactive EstA variant was used as an anchoring motif for the Escherichia coli cell-surface display of lipolytic enzymes. Flow cytometry analysis and measurement of lipase activity revealed that Bacillus subtilis lipase LipA, Fusarium solani pisi cutinase and one of the largest lipases presently known, namely Serratia marcescens lipase were all efficiently exported by the EstA autotransporter and also retained their lipolytic activities upon cell surface exposition. EstA provides a useful tool for surface display of lipases including variant libraries generated by directed evolution thereby enabling the identification of novel enzymes with interesting biological and biotechnological ramifications.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 14;579(5):1183-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In tritium-hydrogen exchange experiments, the large GroEL substrate Rubisco was unfolded and exchanged in urea/acid/tritiated water, then diluted into either protic buffer or protic buffer containing GroEL. The respective Rubisco metastable folding intermediate or Rubisco-GroEL binary complex was then separated from residual tritium after varying times of exchange by centrifugation through P-10 or G-25 resin. No significant tritium was recovered in either case, in contrast to an earlier report. Thus, although the earlier-proposed forced unfolding mechanism for the action of GroEL on a bound polypeptide, occurring during ATP/GroES binding, remains an attractive hypothesis, the data here do not provide any indication that it is involved in the folding of Rubisco.

<ABSTRACT>
An anti-cancer peptide was purified from the Mercenaria (Meretrix meretrix Linnaeus) by the method of chromatography on Sephadex G-25 and FPLC, and its molecular weight was determined to be 3147 Da by the way of MALDI-TOF mass spectrum. The effects of this peptide on human gastric gland carcinoma cells (BGC-823) and their cytoskeletal morphology were investigated. The results showed that the peptide could inhibit the proliferation of BGC-823 cells and obviously destroy the skeletal structures of the cells. When the concentration of the peptide reached 4.0 microg/ml, the inhibition percentage of the cell growth was about 60%. The effects of this anticancer peptide on the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tyrosinase were studied. The results showed that the peptide activated ALP and SOD, but inhibit the tyrosinase activity. When the concentration of the peptide reached to 0.5 microg/ml, the relative activities of SOD, ALP and tyrosinase were determined to be 188.5%, 122.0% and 27.5%, respectively.

DLC-1 (deleted in liver cancer 1) is a Rho GTPase-activating protein that is able to inhibit cell growth and suppress tumorigenesis. We have used homologous recombination to inactivate the mouse DLC-1 gene (Arhgap7). Mice heterozygous for the targeted allele were phenotypically normal, but homozygous mutant embryos did not survive beyond 10.5 days post coitum. Histological analysis revealed that DLC-1-/- embryos had defects in the neural tube, brain, heart, and placenta. Cultured fibroblasts from DLC-1-deficient embryos displayed alterations in the organization of actin filaments and focal adhesions.

<ABSTRACT>
The formation of inclusion bodies in dopaminergic neurons is associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. In order to clarify the role of dopamine/L-dopa in the formation of protein aggregates, we investigated dopamine/L-dopa-related aggregation using an experimental inclusion model. The inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) by alpha-methyltyrosine dramatically decreased MG132-induced aggregate formation. In addition, the inhibition of TH caused the upregulation of proteasomes in cultured cells and the dopamine/L-dopa induced non-enzymatic polymerization of ubiquitin. This inhibition did not affect cell viability. These results suggest that dopamine/L-dopa might enhance aggregate formation, and that intracellular aggregates may not be toxic to cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Most protein structure prediction methods use templates to assist in the construction of protein models. In this paper, we analyse the current state of template-based modelling approaches and reach an estimate of the empirical limits of these methods. Our analysis show that current prediction methods are already reaching these empirical accuracy limits in the easier cases, where finding a close homologue to the native target structure is not a problem. However, we find that even in the absence of alignment errors and using optimal templates, template-based methods have intrinsic limitations, suggesting that other methodologies, such as ab initio procedures, must be used if accuracy is ultimately to be improved.

The X-ray structure of the group 2 major allergen from Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f 2) was determined to 1.83 A resolution. The overall Der f 2 structure comprises a single domain of immunoglobulin fold with two anti-parallel beta-sheets. A large hydrophobic cavity is formed in the interior of Der f 2. Structural comparisons to distantly related proteins suggest a role in lipid binding. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) cross-reactivity between group 2 house dust mite major allergens can be explained by conserved surface areas representing IgE binding epitopes.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 14;579(5):1213-9. Epub 2005 Jan 21.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The mammalian lens consists of an aged core of quiescent cells enveloped by layers of mature fully elongated cells and younger, continuously elongating transcriptionally active cells. The fiber cell maturation is initiated when fiber cells cease to elongate. The process of maturation represents a radical switch from active elongation to a life-long quiescence and has not been studied previously. It may also include critical stages of preparation for the organelle removal and denucleation. In the present study, we used laser capture microdisection (LCM) microdissection and RNA amplification to compare global gene expression profiles of young elongating and mature, non-elongating fiber cells. Analysis of microarray data from three independent dye-swap experiments identified 65 differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.1) with greater than 2-fold change in expression levels. Microarray array results for a group of randomly selected genes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. These microarray results provide clues to understanding the molecular pathways underlying lens development. The identified changes in the profile of gene expression reflected a shift in cell physiology characterizing the lens fiber maturation.

<ABSTRACT>
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are key angiogenic stimulators during normal development and wound healing, as well as in a variety of pathological conditions. Recent studies have demonstrated a synergistic effect of VEGF and PlGF in pathological angiogenesis and suggest a role for PlGF in amplifying VEGF action in endothelial cells. We show here in the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy that VEGF is significantly increased (P<0.01) in the retina at both the mRNA and protein levels. In this mouse model, PlGF was significantly upregulated in the retina at the protein level (P<0.01) without a corresponding change in mRNA levels. In cultured human retinal and umbilical vein endothelial cells, VEGF induced the production of PlGF protein by over 10-fold (P<0.01) in a dose-dependent manner through a post-transcriptional mechanism. The increased PlGF expression upon VEGF treatment was significantly reduced by inhibition of the protein kinase C (PKC) and MEK signaling pathways, as well as by treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that VEGF can amplify its effects on endothelial cells by inducing the production of PlGF via a post-transcriptional mechanism in a PKC-dependent manner, and provide a potential link between PKC inhibition and amelioration of vascular complications in the development of angiogenic diseases.

Ultrastructural stability under high temperature or intensive light stress
conferred by a small heat shock protein in cyanobacteria.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 14;579(5):1235-42. Epub 2005 Jan 26.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The role and sub-cellular localization of the small heat shock protein HspA under stress conditions was investigated comparing the cyanobacterium Synechococcus strain ECT16-1, which constitutively expresses HspA, with the reference strain ECT. The ultrastructure of ECT cells under elevated temperature or intensive light stress exhibited severe damage including aggregation of cytosol and disordered thylakoid membranes, but in ECT16-1 cells these ultrastructural changes were much less conspicuous. Immunocytochemical studies showed that the main localization of HspA in the ECT16-1 cells shifted from the thylakoid area to the cytoplasm, then back to thylakoid area during the heat stress. Expression of HspA stabilized the morphology of nucleoids. The results are discussed, in particular with respect to the unique property of HspA to associate with thylakoid membranes.

Auxin-induced reactive oxygen species production requires the activation

FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 14;579(5):1243-8. Epub 2005 Jan 24.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We recently reported that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is essential for auxin-induced gravitropic signaling. Here, we investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and its product, PtdIns(3)P, in auxin-mediated ROS production and the root gravitropic response. Pretreatment with LY294002, an inhibitor of PtdIns 3-kinase activity, blocked auxin-mediated ROS generation, and reduced the sensitivity of root tissue to gravistimulation. The amount of PtdIns(3)P increased in response to auxin, and this effect was abolished by pretreatment with LY294002. In addition, sequestration of PtdIns(3)P by transient expression of the endosome binding domain in protoplasts abrogated IAA-induced ROS accumulation. These results indicate that activation of PtdIns 3-kinase and its product PtdIns(3)P are required for auxin-induced production of ROS and root gravitropism.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In this study, the effects of short-term diabetes (4 days) on rat renal glomerular cells proliferation and the potential involvement of sphingolipids in this process were investigated. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes promoted increased intra-glomerular hyperplasia, particularly marked for mesangial cells. This was associated with a concomitant increase in neutral ceramidase and sphingosine-kinase activities and the accumulation of the pro-proliferative sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate, in glomeruli isolated from kidney cortex of STZ-treated rats. These results suggest a possible involvement of sphingolipid metabolites in the glomerular proliferative response during the early stages of diabetic nephropathy.

<ABSTRACT>
Photodynamic treatment (PDT) is an emerging procedure for the therapy of cancer, based on photosensitizers, compounds that generate highly reactive oxygen species on illumination with visible light. Photodynamic peroxidation of cellular lipids is a consequence of PDT associated with cytolethality. We used chloromethyl dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and a novel fluorescent ratiometric oxidation-sensitive probe, C11-BODIPY581/591 (C11-BO), which reports on lipid peroxidation, for visualizing oxidative stress in cells subjected to PDT with a phthalocyanine photosensitizer Pc4. With C11-BO loaded into the cells before or immediately after PDT, we observed a prolonged oxidation, which continued up to 30 min after illumination. In contrast, H2O2 caused oxidation of C11-BO only when the cells were in direct contact with H2O2. PDT-induced oxidative stress was most pronounced in vesicular perinuclear organelles, most likely photodamaged lysosomes. We hypothesize that the lysosomal localization of the prolonged oxidative stress is a consequence of the presence of redox-active iron in lysosomes. In conclusion, we have found that oxidative stress induced in cells by PDT differs from one induced by H2O2 in respect of induction of prolonged oxidation of lipids.

A thermodynamic study of mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic
L-arabinose isomerases: the effects of divalent metal ions on protein

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
To gain insight into the structural stability of homologous homo-tetrameric l-arabinose isomerases (AI), we have examined the isothermal guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced unfolding of AIs from mesophilic Bacillus halodurans (BHAI), thermophilic Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GSAI), and hyperthermophilic Thermotoga maritima (TMAI) using circular dichroism spectroscopy. The GdnHCl-induced unfolding of the AIs can be well described by a two-state reaction between native tetramers and unfolded monomers, which directly confirms the validity of the linear extrapolation method to obtain the intrinsic stabilities of these proteins. The resulting unfolding free energy (DeltaGU) values of the AIs as a function of temperature were fit to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation to determine their thermodynamic parameters based on a two-state mechanism. Compared with the stability curves of BHAI in the presence and absence of Mn2+, those of holo GSAI and TMAI were more broadened than those of the apo enzymes at all temperatures, indicating increased melting temperatures (Tm) due to decreased heat capacity (DeltaGp). Moreover, the extent of difference in DeltaCp between the apo and holo thermophilic AIs is larger than that of BHAI. From these studies, we suggest that the metal dependence of the thermophilic AIs, resulting in the reduced DeltaCp, may play a significant role in structural stability compared to their mesophilic analogues, and that the extent of metal dependence of AI stability seems to be highly correlated to oligomerization.

Statin-inhibited endothelial permeability could be associated with its
effect on PECAM-1 in endothelial cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 14;579(5):1272-8. Epub 2005 Jan 26.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are known to inhibit leukocyte recruitment to endothelium but the mechanism is less understood. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) is an endothelial junction protein involved in leukocyte diapedesis. We hypothesize that in endothelial cells, statins may well recruit PECAM-1 to exert their inhibitory effect on leukocyte trans-endothelial migration (TEM). In lovastatin-treated resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), increased levels of mRNA and protein of PECAM-1 as well as its bio-synthesis (all approximately 2-fold) were observed by real-time PCR, Western blotting and 35S-labeled methionine incorporation assay, respectively. Moreover, in lovastatin treated resting cells as well as TNF-alpha activated endothelial cells, unanimously decreased Triton X-100 insoluble and soluble PECAM-1 ratio was observed. Such changes were accompanied by decreased TEM of U-937 cells (a promonocyte cell line). All lovastatin's effects were abrogated by mevalonic acid. In resting HUVECs, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), but not farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) (both are isoprenoid intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway) compromised the effect of lovastatin on PECAM-1 expression, whereas C3 toxin, an inhibitor of small G proteins, exerted statin-like effect. CONCLUSION: Statin-reduced endothelial permeability could be attributed to altered intracellular distribution of PECAM-1 in endothelial cells. We speculate that lovastatin regulates PECAM-1 expression in HUVECs through the mevalonate-GGPP pathway by inhibiting of Rho small GTPase.

Overexpression of small glutamine-rich TPR-containing protein promotes
apoptosis in 7721 cells.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
It is known that small glutamine-rich TPR-containing protein (SGT) is the member of TPR motif family. However, the biological functions of SGT remain unclear. In this paper, we report that SGT plays a role in apoptotic signaling. Ectopic expression of SGT enhances DNA fragment and nucleus breakage after the induction of apoptosis. Increasing mRNA level of SGT is also observed in 7721 cells undergoing apoptosis, knockdown the expression of endogenous SGT contributes to the decrease of apoptosis of 7721 cells. Deletion analysis reveals that TPR domain is critical to pro-apoptotic function of SGT. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the PARP cleavage and cytochrome c release are enhanced when SGT is overexpressed in 7721 cells during apoptosis. Collectively, our results indicate that SGT is a new pro-apoptotic factor.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cathepsin S is unique among mammalian cysteine cathepsins in being active and stable at neutral pH. We show that autocatalytic activation of procathepsin S at low pH is a bimolecular process that is considerably accelerated (approximately 20-fold) by glycosaminoglycans and polysaccharides such as dextran sulfate, chondroitin sulfates A and E, and dermatan sulfate through electrostatic interaction with the proenzyme. Procathepsin S is also shown to undergo autoactivation at neutral pH in the presence of dextran sulfate with t1/2 of approximately 20 min at pH 7.5. This novel property of procathepsin S may have implications in pathological conditions associated with the appearance of active cathepsins outside lysosomes.

<ABSTRACT>
Efficacious cationic transfection lipids usually need either DOPE or cholesterol as co-lipid to deliver DNA inside the cell cytoplasm in non-viral gene delivery. If both of these co-lipids fail in imparting gene transfer properties, the cationic lipids are usually considered to be transfection inefficient. Herein, using both the reporter gene assay in CHO, COS-1 and HepG2 cells and the whole cell histochemical X-gal staining assay in representative CHO cells, we demonstrate that common co-lipids DOPE, Cholesterol and DOPC, when act in synergy, are capable of imparting improved gene transfer properties to a novel series of cationic lipids (1-5). Contrastingly, lipids 1-5 became essentially transfection-incompetent when used in combination with each of the pure co-lipid components alone.

<ABSTRACT>
We previously reported that hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells caused by prostaglandin (PG) F2alpha is mediated by the induction of NOX1, a catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase that generates superoxide. The signal transduction pathway(s) involved in this process, however, remained unresolved. PGF2alpha enhanced the phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, and a selective inhibitor of EGF receptor kinase, tyrphostin AG1478, significantly suppressed PGF2alpha-induced NOX1 expression. AG1478 also blunted the PGF2alpha-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2 and Akt. Phosphoinositide 3 (PI3) kinase inhibitors not only reduced PGF2alpha-induced NOX1 expression, but also suppressed the phosphorylation of ATF-1, a transcription factor previously shown to play a key role in the induction of NOX1. Accordingly, the transactivation of the EGF receptor and the activation of ERK1/2, PI3 kinase, and ATF-1 constitute the signaling pathways involved in the upregulation of NOX1.

<ABSTRACT>
Acaryochloris marina is a prochlorophyte-like cyanobacterium containing both phycobilins and chlorophyll d as light harvesting pigments. We show that the chlorophyll d light harvesting system, composed of Pcb proteins, functionally associates with the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center (RC) core to form a giant supercomplex. This supercomplex has a molecular mass of about 2300 kDa and dimensions of 385 A x 240 A. It is composed of two PSII-RC core dimers arranged end-to-end, flanked by eight symmetrically related Pcb proteins on each side. Thus each PSII-RC monomer has four Pcb subunits acting as a light harvesting system which increases the absorption cross section of the PSII-RC core by almost 200%.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Conflicting reports exist on the effect of actin depolymerization in anti-Fas-induced apoptosis. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has been found to inhibit apoptosis in variable cell types. In this study, we evaluated LPA's protective effects on anti-Fas-induced apoptosis enhanced by actin depolymerization and possible mechanisms in epithelial ovarian cancer. OVCAR3 cells were pretreated with vehicle or LPA, then treated with Cytochalasin D (Cyto D), followed with anti-Fas mAb to induce apoptosis. Cells were stained with apoptotic markers and analyzed by flow cytometry. We report that LPA inhibited anti-Fas-induced apoptosis enhanced by actin depolymerization. Immunoprecipition of Fas death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and Western blot suggested that the actin depolymerization accelerated caspase-8 activation, while LPA inhibited the association and activation of caspase-8 at the DISC. LPA inhibited caspase-3 and 7 activation induced by anti-Fas and/or Cyto D in cytosols. Phosphorylation of ERK and Bad112 by LPA may play a role in preventing caspase-3 activation through mitochondrial pathway induced by Cyto D. Our investigation found that LPA inhibited anti-Fas-induced apoptosis enhanced by actin depolymerization, and LPA may protect epithelial ovarian cancer from immune cell attack and cytoskeleton disrupting reagents induced apoptosis through multiple pathways.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The pathways involved in the maintenance of human embryonic stem (hES) cells remain largely unknown, although some signaling pathways have been identified in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. Fibroblast feeder layers are used to maintain the undifferentiated growth of hES cells and an examination of the conditioned media (CM) of human neonatal fibroblasts (HNFs) could provide insights into the maintenance of hES cells. The neonatal foreskin fibroblast line (HNF02) used in this study was shown to have a normal 2n = 46, XY chromosomal complement and to support the undifferentiated growth of the Embryonic Stem Cell International Pte. Ltd.-hES3 cell line. The CM of HNF02 was examined using two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2-D LCMS) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (2-DE/MALDI). A total of 102 proteins were identified, 19 by 2-DE/MALDI, 53 by 2-D LCMS and 30 by both techniques. These proteins were classified into 15 functional groups. Proteins identified in the extracellular matrix and differentiation and growth factor functional categories were considered most likely to be involved in the maintenance of hES cell growth, differentiation and pluripotency as these groups contained proteins involved in a variety of events including cell adhesion, cell proliferation and inhibition of cell proliferation, Wnt signaling and inhibition of bone morphogenetic proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Difference in two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis (DIGE) is a novel method for analyzing up to three samples in one 2-D gel and using the information gained to study post-translational modifications of proteins. We describe the use of DIGE to isolate and characterize those proteins that undergo processing in spermatozoa as they transit the epididymal tract. We find up to 60 protein spots are significantly modified as sperm traverse the epididymis. In this article, we report eight unambiguous protein identifications and demonstrate that one protein, the beta-subunit of the mitochondrial F1-ATPase, is serine-phosphorylated as sperm undergo epididymal maturation. We suggest that phosphorylation of this particular protein in a cAMP-dependent manner may contribute to the mechanisms by which motility is conferred upon spermatozoa.

<ABSTRACT>
Drought is one of the major factors limiting the yield of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.). The identification of candidate genes for marker-assisted selection (MAS) could greatly improve the efficiency of breeding for increased drought tolerance. Drought-induced changes in the proteome could highlight important genes. Two genotypes of sugar beet (7112 and 7219-P.69) differing in genetic background were cultivated in the field. A line-source sprinkler irrigation system was used to apply irrigated and water deficit treatments beginning at the four-leaf stage. At 157 days after sowing, leaf samples were collected from well-watered and drought-stressed plants for protein extraction and to measure shoot biomass and leaf relative water content. Changes induced in leaf proteins were studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and quantitatively analyzed using image analysis software. Out of more than 500 protein spots reproducibly detected and analyzed, 79 spots showed significant changes under drought. Some proteins showed genotype-specific patterns of up- or downregulation in response to drought. Twenty protein spots were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), leading to identification of Rubisco and 11 other proteins involved in redox regulation, oxidative stress, signal transduction, and chaperone activities. Some of these proteins could contribute a physiological advantage under drought, making them potential targets for MAS.

High molecular mass proteome of androgen-independent prostate cancer.

Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):1097-112.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We made a comprehensive study of protein expression of androgen-independent (AI) prostate cancer by means of agarose two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (agarose 2-DE) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric analysis. The agarose 2-DE method being good at separating high molecular mass (HMM) proteins and alkaline ones, so we were able to successfully reveal differences between the proteomes of androgen-dependent (AD) tumors and those of AI tumors. During the creation of agarose 2-DE protein maps, we successfully identified 295 proteins (91.0%) out of 324 spots excised in total. Excluding redundant and mouse serum proteins, we considered the remaining 225 proteins to be related to the cancer. We divided the 225 cancer-related proteins into HMM and low molecular mass (LMM) groups by their molecular mass being above or below 80 kDa. Functional classification of the proteins in these two groups showed clear differences between the two: more than half (54.8%) of the HMM proteins, but less than one-third (29.1%) of the LMM ones were classified among transcription- or translation-related proteins. Eighteen proteins were regulated when the tumor progressed from an AD to an AI state. Five of these proteins, including antioxidant protein 2, superoxide dismutase 1, thioredoxin peroxidase, GTP-binding protein beta chain homolog, and the ha1225 gene product, had a function to protect cells against oxidant stress-induced apoptosis. We suggest that prevention against oxidative stress is one of the key points for prostate cancer to obtain androgen independency. We also found proteins that had not been previously reported in prostate cancer by use of genomic or conventional 2-DE based proteomic approaches. The proteomic approach, using agarose 2-DE focused on HMM proteins, has the capability to find novel biomarkers of prostate cancer.

Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):1113-24.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A mutation in the thyroglobulin (Tg) gene is the primary cause of hereditary dwarfism and hypothyroidism in the rdw rat. Despite the Tg mutation that causes a Tg shortage, rdw rats survive. The present study examines the influences of this condition on the pancreatic proteome. Normal control (group 1; n = 19) and rdw rats that did not receive L-thyroxine (T4) (group 2; n = 27) were sacrificed from 4 to 56 weeks after birth. The rdw rats were supplemented either with daily intraperitoneal injections of T4 from 3 to 28 days after birth (group 3; n = 4) or with normal thyroid tissues grafted at 4 weeks of age (group 4; n = 3). Groups 3 and 4 were sacrificed 12 weeks after birth. Pancreatic proteomes analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that levels of at least four pancreatic proteins were higher in group 2 than in group 1, and that those of four were lower. Cluster decomposition and principal component analysis of the eight protein contents showed that groups 1 and 2 were separated into two clusters and that pancreatic proteomes of group 4 were better normalized than those of group 3. Injecting T4 into group 3 was temporarily effective, whereas the thyroid graft to group 4 provided a continuous positive effect, which concurred with the increased body weight of the other two groups of rdw rats that received grafts of normal thyroids.

<ABSTRACT>
Calcified organic substances in the skeleton contain a protein-polysaccharide complex taking a key role in the regulation of bio-calcification. However, information concerning the matrix proteins in alcyonarian and their effect on calcification process is still unknown. For this reason, we have studied the organic matrix of endoskeletal spicules from the alcyonarian coral, Synularia polydactyla, to analyze the proteins with their sequences and investigate the functional properties by a molecular approach. The separated spicules from the colony were identified by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The soluble organic matrix comprised 0.04% of spicule weight. By recording decline of pH in the experimental design, the inhibitory effect of the matrix on CaCO3 precipitation was revealed. Prior to electrophoresis, our analysis of proteins extracted from the soluble organic matrix of the spicules revealed an abundance of proteins in molecular weight. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of the preparations showed seven bands of proteins with an apparent molecular mass of 109, 83, 70, 63, 41, 30 and 22 kDa. The proteins were electrophoresed on Tricine-SDS-PAGE after electro-elution treatment, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes and their N-termini were sequenced. Two bands of proteins of about 70 and 63 kDa successfully underwent N-terminal amino acid sequencing. For the detection of calcium binding proteins, a Ca2+ overlay analysis was conducted on the extract by 45Ca autoradiography. The 109 and 63 kDa calcium binding proteins were found to be radioactive. Periodic acid schiff staining indicated that 83 and 63 kDa proteins were glycosylated. An assay for carbonic anhydrase, which is thought to play an important role in the process of calcification revealed low level of the activity. These findings suggest that the endoskeletal spicules of alcyonarian corals have protein-rich organic matrices, which might be related to the calcification process.

<ABSTRACT>
Of the numerous factors affecting rice yield, how solar radiation is transformed into biomass through rice leaves is the most important. We have analyzed proteomic changes in rice leaves collected from six different developing stages (vegetative to ripening). We studied protein expression profiles of rice leaves by running two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Differential protein expression among the six phases were analyzed by image analysis, which allowed the identification of 49 significantly different gel spots. The spots were further verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, in which 89.8% of them were confirmed to be rice proteins. Finally, we confirmed some of the interesting rice proteins by immunoblotting. Three major conclusions can be drawn from these experimental results. (i) Protein expression in rice leaves, at least for high or middle abundance proteins, is attenuated during growth (especially some chloroplast proteins). However, the change is slow and the expression profiles are relatively stable during rice development. (ii) Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), a major protein in rice leaves, is expressed at constant levels at different growth stages. Interestingly, a high ratio of degradation of the RuBisCO large subunit was found in all samples. This was confirmed by two approaches, mass spectrometry and immunoblotting. The degraded fragments are similar to other digested products of RuBisCO mediated by free radials. (iii) The expression of antioxidant proteins such as superoxide dismutase and peroxidase decline at the early ripening stage.

<ABSTRACT>
Tumor development and progression consist of a series of complex processes involving multiple changes in gene expression (Paolo et al. Physiol. Rev., 1993, 73, 161-195; Lance et al. Cell., 1991, 64, 327-336). Tumor cells acquire an invasive and metastatic phenotype that is the main cause of death for cancer patients. Therefore, for early diagnosis and effective therapeutic intervention, we need to detect the alterations associated with transition from benign to malignant tumor cells on a molecular basis. To unravel alterations concerned with tumor progression, the proteomic approach has attracted great attention because it can identify qualitative and quantitative changes in protein composition, including post-translational modifications. In this study, we performed proteomic differential display analysis for the expression of intracellular proteins in the regressive cancer cell line QR-32 and the inflammatory cell-promoting progressive cancer cell line QRsP-11 of murine fibrosarcoma by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry using an Agilent 1100 LC/MSD Trap XCT. We found 11 protein spots whose expression was different between QR-32 and QRsP-11 cells and identified nine proteins, seven of which, calreticulin precursor, tropomyosin 1 alpha chain, annexin A5, heat shock protein (HSP)90-alpha, HSP90-beta, PEBP, and Prx II, were over-expressed, and two, Anp32e and HDGF, which were down-regulated. The results suggest an important complementary role for proteomics in identification of molecular abnormalities in tumor progression.

<ABSTRACT>
Clinical proteomics requires the stable and reproducible analysis of a large number of human samples. We report a high-throughput comprehensive protein profiling system comprising a fully automated, on-line, two-dimensional microflow liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (2-D microLC-MS/MS) system for use in clinical proteomics. A linear ion-trap mass spectrometer (ITMS) also known as a 2-D ITMS instrument, which is characterized by high scan speed, was incorporated into the microLC-MS/MS system in order to obtain highly improved sensitivity and resolution in MS/MS acquisition. This system was used to evaluate bovine serum albumin and human 26S proteasome. Application of these high-throughput microLC conditions and the 2-D ITMS resulted in a 10-fold increase in sensitivity in protein identification. Additionally, peptide fragments from the 26S proteasome were identified three-fold more efficiently than by the conventional 3-D ITMS instrument. In this study, the 2-D microLC-MS/MS system that uses linear 2-D ITMS has been applied for the plasma proteome analysis of a few samples from healthy individuals and lung adenocarcinoma patients. Using the 2-D and 1-D microLC-MS/MS analyses, approximately 250 and 100 different proteins were detected, respectively, in each HSA- and IgG-depleted sample, which corresponds to only 0.4 microL of blood plasma. Automatic operation enabled the completion of a single run of the entire 1-D and 2-D microLC-MS/MS analyses within 11 h. Investigation of the data extracted from the protein identification datasets of both healthy and adenocarcinoma groups revealed that several of the group-specific proteins could be candidate protein disease markers expressed in the human blood plasma. Consequently, it was demonstrated that this high-throughput microLC-MS/MS protein profiling system would be practically applicable to the discovery of protein disease markers, which is the primary objective in clinical plasma proteome projects.

Proteomics of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 biofilm reveals differentially
expressed proteins, including AggA and RibB.

<ABSTRACT>
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a Gram-negative, facultative aerobic bacterium, able to respire a variety of electron acceptors. Due to its capability to reduce solid ferric iron, S. oneidensis plays an important role in microbially induced corrosion of metal surfaces. Since this requires cellular adhesion to the metal surface, biofilm growth is an essential feature of this process. The goal of this work was to compare the global protein expression patterns of sessile and planktonic grown S. oneidensis cells by two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis. Mass spectrometry was used as an identification tool of the differentially expressed proteins. An IPG strip of pH 3-10 as well as pH 4-7 was applied for iso-electrofocusing. Analysis of the 2-D patterns pointed out a total of 59 relevant spots. Among these proteins, we highlight the involvement of a protein annotated as an agglutination protein (AggA). AggA is a TolC-like protein which is presumably part of an ABC transporter. Another differentially expressed protein is RibB, an enzyme of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway. Riboflavin is the precursor molecule of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and may be necessary for the altered respiratory properties of the biofilm cells versus planktonic cells. Some proteins that were identified indicate an anaerobic state of the biofilm. This anaerobic way of living affects the energy gaining pathways of the cell and is reflected by the presence of several proteins, including those of a heme-utilization system.

Phosphoproteome and transcriptome analysis of the neuronal response to a
CDK5 inhibitor.

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(5):1299-307.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis deregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) causes hyperphosphorylation of tau and neurofilament proteins, respectively, leading to neuronal cell death. We have demonstrated recently that pharmacological inhibition of CDK5 protects neurons under various stressful conditions (Weishaupt J. H., et al., Molec. Cell. Neurosci. 2003, 24, 489-502). To get an overview on the cellular mechanisms of action we analyzed global changes in protein phosphorylation in cultured cerebellar granule neurons by [(32)P]orthophosphate labeling after administration of a CDK5 inhibitor. Since CDK5 has recently been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate transcription factor MEF2, we included gene expression profiling using cDNA microarrays. By two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF)-mass spectrometry we identified several phosphoproteins that were modulated by compound administration. Among them syndapin I which is involved in vesicle recycling, and dynein light intermediate chain 2 which represents a regulatory subunit of the dynein protein complex. These findings are consistent with the known physiological function of CDK5 in synaptic signaling and axonal transport. Moreover, we detected phosphoproteins acting in neuronal surival and/or neurite outgrowth, such as cofilin and collapsin response mediator protein. Subsequent testing in cell cultures revealed that the CDK5 inhibitor blocked mitochondrial translocation of pro-apoptotic cofilin in cerebellar granule neurons and enhanced neurite outgrowth in dorsal root ganglia. Numerous genes exhibiting MEF2 consensus binding sequences were modulated by CDK5 inhibitor treatment. Among them some that may contribute to neurite elongation or neuronal survival, but also several genes functioning in synaptic transmission. Taken together, phosphoproteome and transcriptome analysis indicate that the compound promotes both neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth, but also may affect synaptic function in cultured neurons.

Differential accumulation of Lhcb gene products in thylakoid membranes of
Zea mays plants grown under contrasting light and temperature conditions.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(3):758-68.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In higher plants many different genes encode Lhcb proteins that belong to a highly conserved protein family. Evolutionary conservation of this genetic redundancy suggests that individual gene products play different roles in light harvesting and photoprotection depending on environmental conditions. We have tested the hypothesis that expression/accumulation of individual light harvesting complex (Lhc) proteins depends on plant growth conditions. Zea mays plants were grown in different temperature (13 degrees C vs. 24 degrees C) and light (high vs. low) conditions. The thylakoid membranes were isolated and fractionated by sucrose gradient and the protein content of the different bands was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Significant differences were found in the accumulation of both the major light harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCII) complexes and the minor antenna chlorophyll proteins CP29, CP26 and CP24. In particular, temperature seems to play a major role in driving the expression/accumulation of the different proteins: the LHCII/minor antenna ratio increases with decreasing temperature. The pigment composition and the spectroscopic properties of LHCII complexes isolated from low temperature grown plants are significantly different from those of LHCII purified from high temperature grown plants. Two-dimensional maps show that different LHCII proteins are accumulated at different levels depending on growth conditions. Moreover the low temperature/high light grown plants show an increased value of nonphotochemical quenching. These results suggest a specific role of different LHCII complexes in the organization of the potosystem II and photoprotection.

A proteomic approach to studying biogenic amine producing lactic acid
bacteria.

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(3):687-98.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
All fermented foods are subject to the risk of biogenic amine contamination. Histamine and tyramine are among the most toxic amines for consumers' health, exerting undesirable effects on the central nervous and vascular systems, but putrescine and cadaverine can also compromise the organoleptic properties of contaminated foods. These compounds are produced by fermenting microbial flora that decarboxylate amino acids to amines. Little is known of the factors which induce biosynthesis of decarboxylating enzymes and/or which modulate their catalytic activity: the accumulation of amines is generally considered to be a mechanism that contrasts an acidic environment and/or that produces metabolic energy through coupling amino acid decarboxylation with electrogenic amino acid/amine antiporters. Two Lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus sp. 30a (ATCC 33222), and a Lactobacillus sp. strain (w53) isolated from amine-contaminated wine, carrying genetic determinants for histidine decarboxylase (HDC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), were studied and the influence of some environmental and nutritional parameters on amine production and protein biosynthesis was analyzed through a proteomic approach; this is the first report of a proteomic analysis of amine-producing bacteria. HDC and ODC biosynthesis were shown to be closely dependent on the presence of high concentrations of free amino acids in the growth medium and to be modulated by the growth phase. The stationary phase and high amounts of free amino acids also strongly induced the biosynthesis of an oligopeptide transport protein belonging to the proteolytic system of Lactic Acid Bacteria. At least two isoforms of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, with different M(r), pI and expression profiles, were identified from Lactobacillus sp. w53: the biosynthesis of one isoform, in particular, is apparently repressed by high concentrations of free amino acids. Other proteins were identified from the Lactobacillus proteome, affording a global knowledge of protein biosynthesis modulation during biogenic amine production.

Glutathione S-transferase tissue profiling by reporter peptide monitoring.

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(3):648-53.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) form a widespread enzyme superfamily mainly involved in phase II detoxification. Differential expression of the various GST isoforms, differing in catalytic and structural properties, correlates with physiological and pathological states. Fast and simple determination of the GST profile is expected to be an important diagnostic tool in disease analysis. Here we propose a combined approach of high resolution separation techniques and electrospray mass spectrometric analyses for characterizing the spectrum of GSTs in male mouse liver. In this approach, the sensitivity and speed required for tissue GST profiling studies is achieved by tracking the reconstructed ion current of selected reporter peptides following chromatographic separation. This simple procedure, in which an affinity protein bait is followed by a chemical fragmentation and mass spectrometric analysis, could be sufficiently sensitive to detect the qualitative differences between physiological and pathological states.

Sequence tag scanning: a new explorative strategy for recognition of
unexpected protein alterations by nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem mass
spectrometry.

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(3):667-74.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Protein analysis by database search engines using tandem mass spectra is limited by the presence of unexpected protein modifications, sequence isoforms which may not be in the protein databases, and poor quality tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) of low abundance proteins. The analysis of expected protein modifications can be efficiently addressed by precursor ion scanning. However, it is limited to modifications that show such a characteristic loss in a peptide independent manner. We observed that proline and aspartic acid induced backbone fragmentation is accompanied by a low intensity signal for loss of H3PO4 for several pSer- or pThr-phosphopeptides. We describe here the use of peptide-specific fragments that can be used after a protein was identified to allow in-depth characterization of modifications and isoforms. We consider high abundance fragments formed by cleavage at the C-terminal side of aspartic acid, at the N-terminal side of proline and low mass ions such as a2, b2, b3, y1, y2, and y3. The MS/MS dataset is filtered for each sequence tag of interest by an in silico precursor ion scan. The resulting extracted ion traces are then combined by multiplication to increase specificity. Since the strategy is based on common peptide segments which are shared by different isoforms of peptides it can be applied to the analysis of any post-translational modification or sequence variants of a protein. This is demonstrated for the cases of serine and threonine phosphorylation, histone H1 acetylation and the spotting of multiple H1 isoforms.

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(5):1317-30.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In order to avoid the specific problems with intrinsic membrane proteins in proteome analysis, a new procedure was developed which is superior to the classical two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) method in terms of intrinsic membrane proteins. For analysis of the membrane proteome from Corynebacterium glutamicum, we replaced the first separation dimension, i.e., the isoelectric focusing step, by anion-exchange chromatography, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE in the second separation dimension. Enrichment of the membrane intrinsic subproteome was achieved by washing with 2.5 M NaBr which removed more than 35% of the membrane-associated soluble proteins. For the extraction and solubilization of membrane proteins, the detergent amidosulfobetaine 14 (ASB-14) was most efficient in a detailed screening procedure and proved also suitable for chromatography. 356 gel bands were spotted, and out of 170 different identified proteins, 50 were membrane-integral. Membrane proteins with one up to 13 transmembrane helices were found. Careful analysis revealed that this new procedure covers proteins from a wide pI range (3.7-10.6) and a wide mass range of 10-120 kDa. About 50% of the identified membrane proteins belong to various functional categories like energy metabolism, transport, signal transduction, protein translocation, and proteolysis while for the others a function is not yet known, indicating the potential of the developed method for elucidation of membrane proteomes in general.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In order to elucidate the roles of human growth hormone (hGH) in the normal (control) pituitary and in adenomas, the hGH isoforms in the human pituitary were analyzed with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immobilized metal affinity column (Ga(+3)) chromatography, mass spectrometry (MS), and bioinformatics. Twenty-four hGH-containing proteins, with significantly different expression proportions of their isoforms were found. The proportions of isoforms were as follows: isoform 1 (87.5%) > isoform 2 (8.1%) > isoform 3 (3.3%) > isoform 4 (1.1%). Deamidation of asparagine to aspartate was identified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight MS. Tandem mass spectrometry data demonstrated that hGH is a phosphoprotein (spot 6); phosphorylation was found at Ser-77 in the tryptic peptide (68)YSFLQNPQTSLCFSESIPTPSNR(90), at Ser-176 in the tryptic peptide (172)FDTNSHNDDALLK(184), and at Ser-132 in the peptide (126)SLVYGASDSNVYDLLK(141). The phosphorylation sites at Ser-77 and Ser-176 were consistent with computer-program predictions (NetPhos). These results provide novel clues for further studies of the functions, and mechanisms of action, of hGH in the human pituitary and in growth hormone-related diseases.

Effect of training datasets on support vector machine prediction of
protein-protein interactions.

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):876-84.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Knowledge of protein-protein interaction is useful for elucidating protein function via the concept of 'guilt-by-association'. A statistical learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), has recently been explored for the prediction of protein-protein interactions using artificial shuffled sequences as hypothetical noninteracting proteins and it has shown promising results (Bock, J. R., Gough, D. A., Bioinformatics 2001, 17, 455-460). It remains unclear however, how the prediction accuracy is affected if real protein sequences are used to represent noninteracting proteins. In this work, this effect is assessed by comparison of the results derived from the use of real protein sequences with that derived from the use of shuffled sequences. The real protein sequences of hypothetical noninteracting proteins are generated from an exclusion analysis in combination with subcellular localization information of interacting proteins found in the Database of Interacting Proteins. Prediction accuracy using real protein sequences is 76.9% compared to 94.1% using artificial shuffled sequences. The discrepancy likely arises from the expected higher level of difficulty for separating two sets of real protein sequences than that for separating a set of real protein sequences from a set of artificial sequences. The use of real protein sequences for training a SVM classification system is expected to give better prediction results in practical cases. This is tested by using both SVM systems for predicting putative protein partners of a set of thioredoxin related proteins. The prediction results are consistent with observations, suggesting that real sequence is more practically useful in development of SVM classification system for facilitating protein-protein interaction prediction.

<ABSTRACT>
We created an anti-tumor vaccine by using adenovirus as a vector which contains a cytomegalovirus early promoter-directed human carcinoembryonic antigen gene (AdCMV-hCEA). In an attempt to develop the skin patch vaccine, we epicutaneously vaccinated Balb/c mice with AdCMV-hCEA. After nine weeks post-immunization, vaccinated mice evoked a robust antibody titer to CEA and demonstrated the capability of suppressing in vivo growth of implanted murine mammay adenocarioma cell line (JC-hCEA) tumor cells derived from a female Balb/c mouse. Proteomic analysis of the tumor masses in the non-vaccinated naive and vaccinated mice reveal that six proteins change their abundance in the tumor mass. The levels of adenylate kinase 1, beta-enolase, creatine kinase M chain, hemoglobin beta chain and prohibitin were statistically increased whereas the level of a creatine kinase fragment, which is undocumented, was decreased in the tumor of vaccinated mice. These proteins may provide a vital link between early-stage tumor suppression and immune response of skin patch vaccination.

Subproteomes of soluble and structure-bound Helicobacter pylori proteins
analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry.

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(5):1331-45.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common bacterial pathogens and causes a variety of diseases, such as peptic ulcer or gastric cancer. Despite intensive study of this human pathogen in the last decades, knowledge about its membrane proteins and, in particular, those which are putative components of the type IV secretion system encoded by the cag pathogenicity island (PAI) remains limited. Our aim is to establish a dynamic two-dimensional electrophoresis-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE-PAGE) database with multiple subproteomes of H. pylori (http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE) which facilitates identification of bacterial proteins important in pathogen-host interactions. Using a proteomic approach, we investigated the protein composition of two H. pylori fractions: soluble proteins and structure-bound proteins (including membrane proteins). Both fractions differed markedly in the overall protein composition as determined by 2-DE. The 50 most abundant protein spots in each fraction were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. We detected four cag PAI proteins, numerous outer membrane proteins (OMPs), the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA, other potential virulence factors, and few ribosomal proteins in the structure-bound fraction. In contrast, catalase (KatA), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (Ggt), and the neutrophil-activating protein NapA were found almost exclusively in the soluble protein fraction. The results presented here are an important complement to genome sequence data, and the established 2-D PAGE maps provide a basis for comparative studies of the H. pylori proteome. Such subproteomes in the public domain will be effective instruments for identifying new virulence factors and antigens of potential diagnostic and/or curative value against infections with this important pathogen.

C-terminal sequencing by mass spectrometry: application to
gelatine-derived proline-rich peptides.

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(5):1209-16.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Protonated peptides derived from proline-rich proteins (PRP) are often difficult to sequence by standard collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectrometry (MS) due to preferential amide bond cleavage N-terminal to proline. In connection with bovine spongiform encephalopathy regulations, proteolytic products derived from the PRP collagen have been suggested as markers for contamination of animal feedstuffs with processed animal protein (Fernandez Ocana, M. et al., Analyst 2004, 129, 111-115). Herein, we report the identification of these marker peptides using the strategy of C-terminal sequencing by CID MS from their sodium and lithium adducts. Upon fragmentation a new cationized peptide was produced that is one C-terminal amino acid shorter in length. This dissociation pathway allowed for the facile identification of the C-terminal residue by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Each newly formed cationized peptide was further fragmented by up to seven stages of electrospray ionization ion trap MS. Proline-rich C-terminal sequence tags were established which permitted successful database identification of collagen alpha type I proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Commercially available high-content Ab380 and extensively validated DLM26 homemade protein microarrays were used to profile the effects of the pro-atherogenic molecule, oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL), on human aortic smooth muscle cells. Protein microarrays detected 298 proteins in cell lysates and 54 of these were differentially regulated. Microarray data were validated by immunoblotting for a selected set of up- and down-regulated proteins. The protein microarray data sets were compared with our recent cDNA microarray-based gene expression results in order to characterize the global effect of OxLDL on smooth muscle cell functions. A group of cell-cell interaction molecules was classified as up-regulated by OxLDL, whereas nucleic acid/protein biosynthesis, structural and humoral response proteins/genes were under-expressed in cells treated by OxLDL. These findings reveal the major pattern of OxLDL-induced effects on the human aortic smooth muscle cells functions and also demonstrate that protein chip-based microarrays could be a useful proteomic tool to profile disease-related states of muscle cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Strategies employing non-gel based methods for quantitative proteomic profiling such as isotope coded affinity tags coupled with mass spectrometry (ICAT-MS) are gaining attention as alternatives to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). We have conducted a large-scale investigation to determine the degree of reproducibility and depth of proteome coverage of a typical ICAT-MS experiment by measuring protein changes in Escherichia coli treated with triclosan, an inhibitor of fatty acid biosynthesis. The entire ICAT-MS experiment was conducted on four independent occasions where more than 24 000 peptides were quantitated using an ion-trap mass spectrometer. Our results demonstrated that quantitatively, the technique provided good reproducibility (median coefficient of variation of ratios was 18.6%), and on average identified more than 450 unique proteins per experiment. However, the method was strongly biased to detect acidic proteins (pI < 7), under-represented small proteins (<10 kDa) and failed to show clear superiority over 2-DE methods in monitoring hydrophobic proteins from cell lysates.

Pressure overload and neurohumoral activation differentially affect the

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Treatment with monocrotaline causes pulmonary hypertension in rats. This results in severe pressure overload-induced hypertrophy of the right ventricles, whilst the normally loaded left ventricles do not hypertrophy. Both ventricles are affected by enhanced neuroendocrine stimulation in this model. We analyzed in this model load-induced and catecholamine-induced changes of right and left ventricular proteome by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, tryptic in-gel digest, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. All analyzed animals showed right ventricular hypertrophy without signs of heart failure. Changes of 27 proteins in the right and 21 proteins in the left ventricular myocardium were found. Given the hemodynamic features of this animal model, proteome changes restricted to the right ventricle are caused by pressure overload. We describe for the first time a potentially novel pathway (BRAP2/BRCA1) that is involved in myocardial hypertrophy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that increased afterload-induced hypertrophy leads to striking changes in the energy metabolism with down-regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (subunit beta E1), isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinyl coenzyme A ligase, NADH dehydrogenase, ubiquinol-cytochrome C reductase, and propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase. These changes go in parallel with alterations of the thin filament proteome (troponin T, tropomyosin), probably associated with Ca(2+) sensitization of the myofilaments. In contrast, neurohumoral stimulation of the left ventricle increases the abundance of proteins relevant for energy metabolism. This study represents the first in-depth analysis of global proteome alterations in a controlled animal model of pressure overload-induced myocardial hypertrophy.

Microarrays based on affinity-tagged single-chain Fv antibodies: sensitive
detection of analyte in complex proteomes.

<ABSTRACT>
Protein-based microarrays are among the novel class of rapidly emerging proteomic technologies that will allow us to efficiently perform global proteome analysis. However, the process of designing adequate protein microarrays is a major inherent problem. In this study, we have evaluated a protein microarray platform based on nonpurified affinity-tagged single-chain (sc) Fv antibody fragments to generate proof-of-principle and to demonstrate the specificity and sensitivity of the array design. To this end, we used our human recombinant scFv antibody library genetically constructed around one framework, the n-CoDeR library containing 2 x 10(10) clones, as a source for our probes. The probes were immobilized via engineered C-terminal affinity tags, his- or myc-tags, to either Ni(2+)-coated slides or anti-tag antibody coated substrates. The results showed that highly functional microarrays were generated and that nonpurified scFvs readily could be applied as probes. Specific and sensitive microarrays were obtained, providing a limit of detection in the pM to fM range, using fluorescence as the mode of detection. Further, the results showed that spotting the analyte on top of the arrayed probes, instead of incubating the array with large sample volumes (333 pL vs. 40 microL), could reduce the amount of analyte required 4000 times, from 1200 attomole to 300 zeptomole. Finally, we showed that a highly complex proteome, such as human sera containing several thousand different proteins, could be directly fluorescently labeled and successfully analyzed without compromising the specificity and sensitivity of the antibody microarrays. This is a prerequisite for the design of high-density antibody arrays applied in high-throughput proteomics.

Protein expression patterns in zebrafish skeletal muscle: initial
characterization and the effects of hypoxic exposure.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(5):1362-71.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Patterns of protein expression were examined in white skeletal muscle from adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). High resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis resolved between 300 and 400 spots with molecular masses between 20 and 120 kDa and isoelectric points between about 5 and 8. Forty spots, representing a range of protein size, charge, and abundance were excised, digested with trypsin, and subjected to matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry for protein identification. Twenty-nine spots were identified, including enzymes of energy metabolism, contractile proteins, an iron transport protein, and a heat shock protein. In addition, several spots matched theoretical proteins predicted from genome sequencing. These theoretical proteins were tentatively identified by similarity to known proteins. Patterns of muscle protein expression were then measured after zebrafish were exposed to low oxygen (16 torr) for 48 h, an exposure previously shown to increase the survival of zebrafish at more severe reductions in oxygen. Exposure to low oxygen (hypoxia) did not change the general pattern of protein expression but did affect the amounts of six low abundance proteins. The relatively subtle effects of hypoxia on patterns of muscle protein expression contrasts the widespread changes previously documented in mRNA levels in this and other species of fish during hypoxic stress. The difference between protein and mRNA expression illustrates the need to integrate both measures for a more complete understanding of gene expression in fish during hypoxic exposure.

Normalization and analysis of residual variation in two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis for quantitative differential proteomics.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(5):1242-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Although two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) has long been a favorite experimental method to screen proteomes, its reproducibility is seldom analyzed with the assistance of quantitative error models. The lack of models of residual distributions that can be used to assign likelihood to differential expression reflects the difficulty in tackling the combined effect of variability in spot intensity and uncertain recognition of the same spot in different gels. In this report we have analyzed a series of four triplicate two-dimensional gels of chicken embryo heart samples at two distinct development stages to produce such a model of residual distribution. In order to achieve this reference error model, a nonparametric procedure for consistent spot intensity normalization had to be established, and is also reported here. In addition to variability in normalized intensity due to various sources, the residual variation between replicates was observed to be compounded by failure to identify the spot itself (gel alignment). The mixed effect is reflected by variably skewed bimodal density distributions of residuals. The extraction of a global error model that accommodated such distribution was achieved empirically by machine learning, specifically by bootstrapped artificial neural networks. The model described is being used to assign confidence values to observed variations in arbitrary 2-DE gels in order to quantify the degree of over-expression and under-expression of protein spots.

Ribosome inactivating proteins and apoptosis.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 28;579(6):1324-31.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) are protein toxins that are of plant or microbial origin that inhibit protein synthesis by inactivating ribosomes. Recent studies suggest that RIPs are also capable of inducing cell death by apoptosis. Though many reports are available on cell death induced by RIPs, the mechanism involved is not well studied. Comparison of pathways of apoptosis and cellular events induced by various RIPs suggests a central role played by mitochondria, probably acting as an integrator of cellular stress and cell death. The purpose of this review is to compare the various apoptotic pathways that may be involved and propose a general pathway in RIP-induced cell death.

<ABSTRACT>
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolite profiling of biological samples is rapidly becoming one of the cornerstones of functional genomics and systems biology. Thus, the technology needs to be available to many laboratories and open exchange of information is required such as those achieved for transcript and protein data. The key-step in metabolite profiling is the unambiguous identification of metabolites in highly complex metabolite preparations with composite structure. Collections of mass spectra, which comprise frequently observed identified and non-identified metabolites, represent the most effective means to pool the identification efforts currently performed in many laboratories around the world. Here, we describe a platform for mass spectral and retention time index libraries that will enable this process (MSRI; www.csbdb.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/gmd.html). This resource should ameliorate many of the problems that each laboratory will face both for the initial establishment of metabolome analysis and for its maintenance at a constant sample throughput.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Arguably, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial syndrome, rather than single disease, arising from a complex array of neurochemical factors. Numerous studies on the molecular pathogenesis of AD implicate a diversity of factors ranging from neurotoxic peptides (beta-amyloid) to inflammatory processes (interleukins), but all culminating in a common neuropathology. This diversity of molecular causation is an impediment to the design of effective therapies for AD. To address this design problem, we sought to identify a single, common motif (a "common receptor") shared by multiple structurally and functionally diverse proteins implicated in AD. This search revealed the presence of a common BBXB peptide motif and upon refinement, an AXBBXB motif; these regions can be exploited for the design of a "promiscuous drug" that exploits a "one-drug-multiple-receptors" therapeutic strategy for AD.

<ABSTRACT>
The receptor components of the chloroplast protein import machinery, Toc34 and Toc159, are both encoded by small gene families in Arabidopsis thaliana. Recent results suggest that each member of these families preferentially interacts with different groups of precursor proteins. Here we address the question, whether multiple homologous Toc receptors are unique to Arabidopsis or whether they are a general phenomenon in plants. Indeed, in spinach we could identify at least two Toc34 proteins with different substrate specificities as demonstrated by competition and antibody inhibition experiments. In addition, an analysis of the available genomic data revealed the presence of at least two Toc34 homologs in six other plant species.

Tocopherols, collectively known as vitamin E, are only synthesised in photosynthetic organisms. Tocopherol cyclase (TC) catalyses the formation of the chromanol headgroup of the various tocopherol isoforms. TCs from Arabidopsis and maize (Zea mays) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Analysis of the enzymatic properties revealed similarities but also differences between the two enzymes. Overexpression of chimeric TC gene constructs in developing seeds of transgenic rapeseed plants enhanced and modified the relative abundance of individual tocochromanol species in the seed oil, indicating a regulatory function of the enzyme in prenyllipid metabolism.

<ABSTRACT>
We investigated the morphological changes accompanying soldier differentiation in the damp-wood termite Hodotermopsis sjostedti. Genes expressed in the developing mandibles, which undergo the most remarkable morphological changes during soldier differentiation, were screened using fluorescent differential display. Database searches for sequence similarities were conducted and the relative expression levels were then quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among the identified candidate genes, 12 genes were upregulated during soldier differentiation. These included genes for cuticle proteins, nucleic acid binding proteins, ribosomal proteins and actin-binding protein, which were inferred to be involved in caste-specific morphogenesis in termites.

<ABSTRACT>
Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, which plays an important role in physiology and pathology of neurons. Tau has been recently reported to bind double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but not to bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) [Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003, 60, 413-421]. Here, we prove that tau binds not only dsDNA but also ssDNA. This finding was facilitated by using two kinetic capillary electrophoresis methods: (i) non-equilibrium capillary electrophoresis of equilibrium mixtures (NECEEM); (ii) affinity-mediated NECEEM. Using the new approach, we observed, for the first time, that tau could induce dissociation of strands in dsDNA by binding one of them in a sequence-specific fashion. Moreover, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constants for all tau-DNA complexes studied.

<ABSTRACT>
The structure of human cytosolic thymidine kinase in complex with its feedback inhibitor 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-triphosphate was determined. This structure is the first representative of the type II thymidine kinases found in several pathogens. The structure deviates strongly from the known structures of type I thymidine kinases such as the Herpes simplex enzyme. It contains a zinc-binding domain with four cysteines complexing a structural zinc ion. Interestingly, the backbone atoms of the type II enzyme bind thymine via hydrogen-bonds, in contrast to type I, where side chains are involved. This results in a specificity difference exploited for antiviral therapy. The presented structure will foster the development of new drugs and prodrugs for numerous therapeutic applications.

activity of human tripeptidyl-peptidase I.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 28;579(6):1383-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Tripeptidyl-peptidase I (TPP I) is a lysosomal aminopeptidase that sequentially removes tripeptides from small polypeptides and also shows a minor endoprotease activity. Mutations in TPP I are associated with a fatal lysosomal storage disorder--the classic late-infantile form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. In the present study, we analyzed the catalytic mechanism of the human enzyme by using a site-directed mutagenesis. We demonstrate that apart from previously identified Ser475 and Asp360, also Glu272, Asp276, and Asp327 are important for catalytic activity of the enzyme. Involvement of serine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid in the catalytic reaction validates the idea, formulated on the basis of significant amino acid sequence homology and inhibition studies, that TPP I is the first mammalian representative of a growing family of serine-carboxyl peptidases.

<ABSTRACT>
Two classes of quinazolinone derivatives and quinoxaline derivatives were identified as potent and selective poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 and 2 (PARP-1) and (PARP-2) inhibitors, respectively. In PARP enzyme assays using recombinant PARP-1 and PARP-2, quinazolinone derivatives displayed relatively high selectivity for PARP-1 and quinoxaline derivatives showed superior selectivity for PARP-2. SBDD analysis via a combination of X-ray structural study and homology modeling suggested distinct interactions of inhibitors with PARP-1 and PARP-2. These findings provide a new structural framework for the design of selective inhibitors for PARP-1 and PARP-2.

<ABSTRACT>
On stopped-flow analysis of aliphatic aldoxime dehydratase (OxdA), a novel hemoprotein, a spectrum derived from a reaction intermediate was detected on mixing ferrous OxdA with butyraldoxime; it gradually changed into that of ferrous OxdA with an isosbestic point at 421 nm. The spectral change on the addition of butyraldoxime to the ferrous H320A mutant showed the formation of a substrate-coordinated mutant, the absorption spectrum of which closely resembled that of the above intermediate. These observations and the resonance Raman investigation revealed that the substrate actually binds to the heme in OxdA, forming a hexa-coordinate low-spin heme.

<ABSTRACT>
Tau is the major antigenic component of neurofibrillary pathology in tauopathy, including Alzheimer's disease. Although conversion of soluble tau to an insoluble polymerized fibrillar form is a key factor in the pathogenesis of tauopathy, the mechanism of the change is unclear and no inhibitors of fibril formation are available. Monoclonal antibodies against the 1st or 2nd repeat of the microtubule binding domain, but not the C-terminal 16 residues, completely inhibited tau aggregation into PHF. Furthermore, they did not inhibit tau-induced tubulin assembly. Thus, they are useful to investigate tau protein conversion and will be useful therapeutic lead materials.

Characterisation of a novel amylosucrase from Deinococcus radiodurans.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 28;579(6):1405-10.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The BLAST search for amylosucrases has yielded several gene sequences of putative amylosucrases, however, with various questionable annotations. The putative encoded proteins share 32-48% identity with Neisseria polysaccharea amylosucrase (AS) and contain several amino acid residues proposed to be involved in AS specificity. First, the B-domains of the putative proteins and AS are highly similar. In addition, they also reveal additional residues between putative beta-strand 7 and alpha-helix 7 which could correspond to the AS B'-domain, which turns the active site into a deep pocket. Finally, conserved Asp and Arg residues could form a salt bridge similar to that found in AS, which is responsible for the glucosyl unit transfer specificity. Among these found genes, locus NP_294657.1 (dras) identified in the Deinococcus radiodurans genome was initially annotated as an alpha-amylase encoding gene. The putative encoded protein (DRAS) shares 42% identity with N. polysaccharea AS. To investigate the activity of this protein, gene NP_294657.1 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. When acting on sucrose, the pure recombinant enzyme was shown to catalyse insoluble amylose polymer synthesis accompanied by side-reactions (sucrose hydrolysis, sucrose isomer and soluble maltooligosaccharide formation). Kinetic analyses further showed that DRAS follows a non-Michaelian behaviour toward sucrose substrate and is activated by glycogen, as is AS. This demonstrates that gene NP_294657.1 encodes an amylosucrase.

<ABSTRACT>
Most tumor cells attain their immortality by reactivating telomerase. We report here the telomerase inhibitory potential of chimeric oligonucleotides composed of a 13mer antisense sequence targeting the telomerase RNA template region and a (s4dU)n moiety at its 3' or 5'-end. The increase of the thiolated chain length enhances the telomerase inhibitory potential, but decreases specificity, indicated by HIV reverse transcriptase inhibition. Chimeras with 5' (s4dU)(n)s were more potent inhibitors than the antisense alone or the 3' modified ones. Cy5-labeled (s4dU)4AS and (s4dU)8AS proved the internalization of the oligonucleotides, raising the possibility to be tested as cellular anti-telomerase agents.

<ABSTRACT>
CTCF is a transcription factor involved in various aspects of gene regulation. We previously reported that CTCF function is modulated by protein kinase CK2. In this report we investigate further the role of CK2 in regulating the transcriptional properties of CTCF. We demonstrate that coexpression of CTCF with CK2 switches function of CTCF from repressor to activator. The non-phosphorylatable mutant increases repression by CTCF and potentiates the growth-suppressive ability of the protein, whereas the phospho-mimetic mutant behaves in the opposite fashion. Mutation of the individual serines reveals that Serine 612 is a critical residue in regulation of CTCF by CK2.

<ABSTRACT>
The high error rates characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) are a presumptive source of the viral hypervariability that substantially affect viral pathogenesis and resistance to drug therapy. We have analyzed the potential role of polyamines in the fidelity of DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT. The current study suggest that polyamines tested has the potential to be "antimutator". The polyamines exert the ability to reduce the misincorporation and mispair extension with both RNA/DNA and DNA/DNA template-primers in the following order: spermine > spermidine > putrescine. In view of the significance of mutations of HIV, the possible roles of polyamines in the accuracy of DNA synthesis could be of particular importance; polyamines may affect the mutation rate of the virus.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
There are two oligomeric types of glycyl-tRNA synthetases (GlyRSs) in genome, the alpha2beta2 tetramer and alpha2 dimer. Here, we showed that the anticodon-binding domains (ABDs) of dimeric and tetrameric GlyRSs are non-homologous, although their catalytic central domains (CCDs) are homologous. The dimeric GlyRS_ABD is fused to the C-terminal of CCD in alpha-subunit, but the tetrameric GlyRS_ABD is to the C-terminal in beta-subunit during evolution. Generally, one species only contains one oligomeric type of GlyRS, but the both oligomeric GlyRSs with the multiple homologous domains can be observed in Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum genome, nevertheless, these homologous domains are probably from different genomes.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 28;579(6):1446-52.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
PGC-1alpha mRNA and protein are elevated in islets from multiple animal models of diabetes. Overexpression of PGC-1alpha impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). However, it is not well known which metabolic events lead to upregulation of PGC-1alpha in the beta-cells under pathophysiological condition. In present study, we have investigated effects of chronic hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia on PGC-1alpha mRNA expression in isolated rat islets. Isolated rat islets are chronically incubated with 0, 0.2 and 0.4 mM oleic acid/palmitic acid (free fatty acids, FFA) or 5.5 and 25 mM glucose for 72 h. FFA dose-dependently increases PGC-1alpha mRNA expression level in isolated islets. FFA also increases PGC-1alpha expression in mouse beta-cell-derived beta TC3 cell line. In contrast, 25 mM glucose decreases expression level of PGC-1alpha. Inhibition of PGC-1alpha by siRNA improves FFA-induced impairment of GSIS in islets. These data suggest that hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia regulate PGC-1alpha expression in islets differently, and elevated PGC-1alpha by FFA plays an important role in chronic hyperlipidemia-induced beta-cell dysfunction.

Site-specific pseudophosphorylation modulates the rate of tau filament
dissociation.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Hyperphosphorylation of tau is of fundamental importance for neurofibrillary lesion development in Alzheimer's disease, but the mechanisms through which it acts are not clear. Experiments with pseudophosphorylation mutants of full-length tau protein indicate that incorporation of negative charge into specific sites can modulate the aggregation reaction, and that this occurs by altering the critical concentration of assembly. Here, the kinetic origin of this effect was determined using quantitative electron microscopy methods and pseudophosphorylation mutant T212E in a full-length four-repeat tau background. On the basis of disaggregation rates, decreases in critical concentration resulted primarily from decreases in the dissociation rate constant. The results suggest a mechanism through which site-specific posttranslational modifications can modulate filament accumulation at low free intracellular tau concentrations.

Low-molecular-weight organic chromium complexes such as chromium picolinate are often used as dietary supplements to improve insulin sensitivity and to correct dyslipidemia. However, toxicity associated with such chromium compounds has compromised their therapeutic value. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a newly synthesized complex of chromium with phenylalanine, Cr(pa)3 on insulin-signaling and glucose tolerance. Cr(pa)3 was synthesized by chelating chromium(III) with D-phenylalanine ligand in aqueous solution. In mouse 3T3-adipocytes, Cr(pa)3 augmented insulin-stimulated glucose-uptake as assessed by a radioactive-glucose uptake assay. At the molecular level, Cr(pa)3 enhanced insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt in a time- and concentration-dependent manner without altering the phosphorylation of insulin receptor. Oral treatment with Cr(pa)3 (150 microg/kg/d, for six weeks) in ob/ob+/+ obese mice significantly alleviated glucose tolerance compared with untreated obese mice. Unlike chromium picolinate, Cr(pa)3 does not cleave DNA under physiological reducing conditions. Collectively, these data suggest that Cr(pa)3 may represent a novel, less-toxic chromium supplement with potential therapeutic value to improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control in type II diabetes.

<ABSTRACT>
Arrangement of chromatin in intact chicken erythrocyte nuclei was investigated by small angle neutron scattering. The scattering spectra have revealed that on the scales between 15 nm and 1.5 microm the interior of the nucleus exhibited properties of a mass fractal. The fractal dimension of the protein component of cell nucleus held constant at approximately 2.5, while the DNA organization was biphasic, with the fractal dimension slightly higher than 2 on the scales smaller than 300 nm and approaching 3 on the larger scales.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In this study, we demonstrated that Ent-11alpha-hydroxy-15-oxo-kaur-16-en-19-oic-acid (5F) had stronger cytotoxicity against MKN-45, a gastric cancer cell line bearing wild-type p53 than MKN-28, another gastric cancer cell line containing missense mutation in p53. The rapid increase of ROS level was involved in the mechanism of cytotoxicity. Classical features of apoptosis induced by 5F were observed in MKN-45 cells only or more significant in MKN-45 cells than MKN-28 cells. Translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria, reduction of delta psi m and DNA fragmentation were induced by 5F in the p53-dependent manner. We conclude that the expression of Bax and its downstream molecules requires the presentation of a wild-type p53 in the cells treated by 5F.

Cell-cycle-dependent regulation of the human and mouse Tome-1 promoters.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 28;579(6):1488-92.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Tome-1, which refers to a trigger of mitotic entry 1, mediates the destruction of the mitosis-inhibitory kinase, Wee1, via the E3 ligase, SCF. In turn, Tome-1 itself is targeted for degradation by APC in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In the present study, we analyzed the human and mouse Tome-1 promoter regions. Using synchronized cultures of NIH3T3 cells transfected with Tome-1 promoter/luciferase constructs, we showed that the promoter activity of Tome-1 is activated at the G2/M phase. Using various Tome-1 promoter/luciferase constructs, we showed that the CCAAT box located upstream of the transcription initiation site is important for the basal promoter activity. We identified a repressor element (cell-cycle-dependent element/cell cycle gene homology region) in the vicinity of the transcription start site, and mutations within this element diminished the cell-cycle-dependent transcriptional regulation of Tome-1.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We generated a recombinant 96-residue polypeptide corresponding to a sequence Tyr176-Gly273 of ice nucleation protein from Pseudomonas syringae (denoted INP96). INP96 exhibited an ability to shape an ice crystal, whose morphology is highly similar to the hexagonal-bipyramid generally identified for antifreeze protein. INP96 also showed a non-linear, concentration-dependent retardation of ice growth. Additionally, circular dichroism and NMR measurements suggested a local structural construction in INP96, which undergoes irreversible thermal denaturation. These data imply that a part of INP constructs a unique structure so as to interact with the ice crystal surfaces.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A binary vector amenable to high-throughput cloning was constructed for ethanol-inducible expression of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in plants. Silencing of a transgene encoding beta-glucuronidase (GUS) was then examined at RNA and protein levels in tobacco. Transient gene silencing could be effectively achieved in plants with higher expression levels of alcR (the ethanol sensor) after single application of 1% ethanol (v/v) through root drenching. GUS activities showed more dramatic pattern of loss and recovery in young leaves than in older leaves. Repeated ethanol treatment resulted in extended gene suppression and increased loss of GUS activities. Interestingly, recovery of GUS transcript level is dramatically earlier than that of GUS protein levels as measured by enzyme assays. These observations indicate that dsRNA-mediated gene silencing may occur through more stable translational inhibition in addition to reversible targeted RNA degradation.

<ABSTRACT>
The influence of the enhancer of split- and hairy-related protein-2 (SHARP-2) transcriptional repressor on the expression of rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene was examined. When H4IIE cells were treated with epigallocatechin gallate, a green tea constituent, an increase in SHARP-2 mRNA levels and a decrease in PEPCK mRNA levels were observed. The adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SHARP-2 in H4IIE cells and primary cultured rat hepatocytes led to a decrease in the levels of PEPCK mRNA. Finally, when a SHARP-2 expression plasmid was transiently transfected with various reporter plasmids into MH1C1 cells, the promoter activity of a PEPCK reporter plasmid was specifically decreased. Based on these findings, we conclude that SHARP-2 is a potential repressor of PEPCK gene expression.

Heavy metal transport by AtHMA4 involves the N-terminal degenerated metal
binding domain and the C-terminal His11 stretch.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 28;579(6):1515-22.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Arabidopsis thaliana AtHMA4 is a P1B-type ATPase that clusters with the Zn/Cd/Pb/Co subgroup. It has been previously shown, by heterologous expression and the study of AtHMA4 knockout or overexpressing lines in Arabidopsis , that AtHMA4 is implicated in zinc homeostasis and cadmium tolerance. Here, we report the study of the heterologous expression of AtHMA4 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. AtHMA4 expression resulted in an increased tolerance to Zn, Cd and Pb and to a phenotypic complementation of hypersensitive mutants. In contrast, an increased sensitivity towards Co was observed. An AtHMA4::GFP fusion protein was observed in endocytic vesicles and at the yeast plasma membrane. Mutagenesis of the cysteine and glutamate residues from the N-ter degenerated heavy metal binding domain impaired the function of AtHMA4. It was also the case when the C-ter His11 stretch was deleted, giving evidence that these amino acids are essential for the AtHMA4 binding/translocation of metals.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 28;579(6):1523-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been discovered as potential drugs for cancer treatment. The effect of BL1521, a novel HDACi, on the cell cycle distribution and the induction of apoptosis was investigated in a panel of MYCN single copy and MYCN amplified neuroblastoma cell lines. BL1521 arrested neuroblastoma cells in the G1 phase and induced up to 30% apoptosis. Downregulation of CDK4, upregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and an increase of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein were observed, indicating a possible mechanism for the cell-cycle arrest. BL1521 also induced downregulation of p27, which may underlie the observed induction of apoptosis.

<ABSTRACT>
Though the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling in patterning and differentiation during development is well established, the underlying signal transduction mechanisms remain obscure. This is the first report on the overexpression of the human Hh signalling receptor Smoothened (hSmo) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris. We show that hSmo is expressed in both types of yeast in its native conformational state. The first purification presented here will allow the characterisation of hSmo expressed in yeast, and the scale-up of hSmo production enabling structural studies to develop new therapeutic approaches against tumors and neurodegenerative diseases induced by Hh signalling dysfunction.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Persistent tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) exposure uncouples proximal T-cell receptor (TCR)-signalling events. Here, we demonstrate that chronic TNF-alpha exposure also attenuates signalling distal to the TCR, by specifically inhibiting Ca2+ influx evoked by thapsigargin in CD4+ T-cells. Mitogen-induced Ca2+ responses were impaired in a dose dependent manner, and TCR-induced Ca2+ responses were also significantly reduced. The impairment of Ca2+ influx strongly correlated with poor function as proliferative responses to both mitogen and anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation were suppressed. Our findings show that persistent TNF-alpha exposure of T-cells specifically inhibits store operated Ca2+ influx. This may affect gene activation and contribute to the poor T-cell function in chronic inflammatory disease.

Lysosome destabilization by cytosolic extracts, putative involvement of
Ca(2+)/phospholipase C.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Feb 28;579(6):1551-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Lysosomal disintegration is a crucial event for living cells, but mechanisms for the event are still unclear. In this study, we established that the cytosolic extracts could enhance lysosomal osmotic sensitivity and osmotically destabilize the lysosomes. The cytosol also caused the lysosomes to become more swollen in the hypotonic sucrose medium. The results indicate that the cytosol induced an osmotic shock to the lysosomes and an influx of water into the organelle. Since the effects of cytosol on the lysosomes could be abolished by O-tricyclo[5.2.1.0(2,6)]dec-9-yl dithiocarbonate potassium salt (D609), a specific inhibitor of cytosolic phospholipase C (PLC), the PLC might play an important role in the lysosomal osmotic destabilization. The activity of cytosolic PLC and the extent of enzyme latency loss of the cytosol-treated lysosomes exhibited a similar biphasic dependence on the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. In addition, the cytosol did not osmotically destabilize the lysosomes until the cytosolic calcium ions rose above 100 nM. It suggests that the destabilization effect of cytosol on the lysosomes is Ca(2+)-dependent.

<ABSTRACT>
Arginine decarboxylase (ADC) is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the first step of polyamine (PA) biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. We generated a double mutant deficient in Arabidopsis two ADC genes (ADC1-/- ADC2-/-) and examined their roles in seed development. None of the F2 seedlings from crosses of adc1-1 and adc2-2 had the ADC1-/- ADC2-/- genotype. In addition, some abnormal seeds were observed among the ADC1+/- ADC2-/- and ADC1-/- ADC2+/- siliques. Viable offspring with the ADC1-/- ADC2-/- genotype could not be obtained from the ADC1+/- ADC2-/- and ADC1-/- ADC2+/- plants. These results indicate that AtADC genes are required for production of polyamines that are essential for normal seed development in Arabidopsis.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A protein subset expressed in the mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell line, E14-1, was characterized by mass spectrometry-based protein identification technology and data analysis. In total, 1790 proteins including 365 potential nuclear and 260 membrane proteins were identified from tryptic digests of total cell lysates. The subset contained a variety of proteins in terms of physicochemical characteristics, subcellular localization, and biological function as defined by Gene Ontology annotation groups. In addition to many housekeeping proteins found in common with other cell types, the subset contained a group of regulatory proteins that may determine unique ES cell functions. We identified 39 transcription factors including Oct-3/4, Sox-2, and undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor I, which are characteristic of ES cells, 88 plasma membrane proteins including cell surface markers such as CD9 and CD81, 44 potential proteinaceous ligands for cell surface receptors including growth factors, cytokines, and hormones, and 100 cell signaling molecules. The subset also contained the products of 60 ES-specific and 41 stemness genes defined previously by the DNA microarray analysis of Ramalho-Santos et al. (Ramalho-Santos et al., Science 2002, 298, 597-600), as well as a number of components characteristic of differentiated cell types such as hematopoietic and neural cells. We also identified potential post-translational modifications in a number of ES cell proteins including five Lys acetylation sites and a single phosphorylation site. To our knowledge, this study provides the largest proteomic dataset characterized to date for a single mammalian cell species, and serves as a basic catalogue of a major proteomic subset that is expressed in mouse ES cells.

<ABSTRACT>
A novel microarray-based proteolytic profiling assay enabled the rapid determination of protease substrate specificities with minimal sample and enzyme usage. A 722-member library of fluorogenic protease substrates of the general format Ac-Ala-X-X-(Arg/Lys)-coumarin was synthesized and microarrayed, along with fluorescent calibration standards, in glycerol nanodroplets on microscope slides. The arrays were then activated by deposition of an aerosolized enzyme solution, followed by incubation and fluorometric scanning. The specificities of human blood serine proteases (human thrombin, factor Xa, plasmin, and urokinase plasminogen activator) were examined. The arrays provided complete maps of protease specificity for all of the substrates tested and allowed for detection of cooperative interactions between substrate subsites. The arrays were further utilized to explore the conservation of thrombin specificity across species by comparing the proteolytic fingerprints of human, bovine, and salmon thrombin. These enzymes share nearly identical specificity profiles despite approximately 390 million years of divergent evolution. Fluorogenic substrate microarrays provide a rapid way to determine protease substrate specificity information that can be used for the design of selective inhibitors and substrates, the study of evolutionary divergence, and potentially, for diagnostic applications.

Improved proteome coverage by using high efficiency cysteinyl peptide
enrichment: the human mammary epithelial cell proteome.

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(5):1263-73.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Automated multidimensional capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been increasingly applied in various large scale proteome profiling efforts. However, comprehensive global proteome analysis remains technically challenging due to issues associated with sample complexity and dynamic range of protein abundances, which is particularly apparent in mammalian biological systems. We report here the application of a high efficiency cysteinyl peptide enrichment (CPE) approach to the global proteome analysis of human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) which significantly improved both sequence coverage of protein identifications and the overall proteome coverage. The cysteinyl peptides were specifically enriched by using a thiol-specific covalent resin, fractionated by strong cation exchange chromatography, and subsequently analyzed by reversed-phase capillary LC-MS/MS. An HMEC tryptic digest without CPE was also fractionated and analyzed under the same conditions for comparison. The combined analyses of HMEC tryptic digests with and without CPE resulted in a total of 14 416 confidently identified peptides covering 4294 different proteins with an estimated 10% gene coverage of the human genome. By using the high efficiency CPE, an additional 1096 relatively low abundance proteins were identified, resulting in 34.3% increase in proteome coverage; 1390 proteins were observed with increased sequence coverage. Comparative protein distribution analyses revealed that the CPE method is not biased with regard to protein M(r) , pI, cellular location, or biological functions. These results demonstrate that the use of the CPE approach provides improved efficiency in comprehensive proteome-wide analyses of highly complex mammalian biological systems.

Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):16-23.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We describe a method for simultaneous identification and quantitation of proteins within complex mixtures. The method consists of 18O-labeling, a simple stable isotope-coding that requires merely enzymatic digestion in 18O-water, in combination with a capillary-liquid chromatography electrospray ion-trap mass spectrometer. In a separate experiment using the same sample and a spike test, we demonstrate that the difference ration was calculated accurately using the 18O-labeling method even if the protein was part of a complex mixture. Our data also suggest that the accuracy of the quantitation can be improved by averaging the difference ratios of several peptides. In comparing our method with the isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) method, we show that the 18O-labeling method has the advantages of better recovery and fewer isotope effects. Therefore, the 18O-labeling method is a powerful tool for large-scale proteomics applications.

Proteomics. 2005 Jan;5(1):46-54.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Detailed characterization of phosphoproteins as well as other post-translationally modified proteins such as glycoproteins, is required to fully understand protein function and regulatory events in cells and organisms. Therefore, an experimental strategy for the isolation of phosphoproteins using a new immobilized metal ion affinity chromatograph (IMAC) material on the basis of cellulose has been developed and characterized. Different approaches have been used to test the material. Recovery rates were determined by 32P labelling of a myelin basic protein fragment and by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a tryptic digest of the model protein bovine beta-casein. Selectivity was demonstrated by enrichment and separation of phosphopeptides from different samples, such as from a digest of horse myoglobin as well as from a digest of in vitro phosphorylated extracellular signal regulates kinase 2 (ERK2) mixed with synthetic phosphopeptides, phosphorylated on different amino acid residues. Furthermore, simplification and optimization of sample pretreatment was achieved by combining the separating (IMAC) and desalting (C18) step during preparative high performance liquid chromatography. The comparison between our material and a commercially available IMAC system (POROS 20 MC; Perspective BioSystems) emphasizes the competitiveness of the cellulose. Confirmed by the obtained data, the cellulose material performed as well as the commercially available sorbent, however with the advantage, that it can be produced rather easily and at very low cost.

<ABSTRACT>
Data mining, finding and integration of information about proteins of interest, is an essential component in modern biological and biomedical research. Even when focusing on a single organism and only on a small number of proteins, there are often dozens fo data sources containing relevant information. We are developing PRIME, a protein information environment, to serve as a virtual central database which integrates distributed heterogeneous information about proteins (linked by common identifier). PRIME has powerful capabilities to visualize all kinds of protein annotation in specialized views. These views can be displayed side by side at the same time and can be synchronized in order to show simultaneously different aspects of identical proteins. These features allow a quick and comprehensive overview of properties of single proteins or protein sets.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) is a tool for measuring changes in protein expression between samples involving pre-electrophoretic labeling ith cyanine dyes. In multi-gel experiments, univariate statistical tests have been used to identify differential expression between sample types by looking for significant changes in spot volume. Multivariate statistical tests, which look for correlated changes between sample types, provide an alternate approach for identifying spots with differential expression. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), a multivariate statistical approach, was combined with an iterative threshold process to identify which protein spots had the greatest contribution to the model, and compared to univariate test for three datasets. This included one dataset where no biological difference was expected. The novel multivariate approach, detailed here, represents a method to complement the univariate approach in identification of differentially expressed protein spots. This new approach has the advantages of reduced risk of false-positives and the identification of spots that are significantly altered in terms of correlated expression rather than absolute expression values.

<ABSTRACT>
Exploration of the lenticular proteome poses a challenging and worthwhile undertaking as cataracts, the products of a disease phenotype elicited by this proteome, remains the leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. The complete ten day old lens proteome of Mus musculus C57BL/6J was resolved into 900 distinct spots by large gel carrier ampholyte based 2-DE. The predicted amino acid sequences of all 16 crystallins ubiquitous in mammals were corroborated by mass spectrometry (MS). In detailed individual spot analyses, the primary structure of the full murine C57BL/6J beaded filament component phakinin CP49 was sequenced by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem MS and amended at two positions. This definitive polypeptide sequence was aligned to the mouse genome, thus identifying the entire C57BL/6J genomic coding region. Also, two murine C57/6J polypeptides, both previously classified as gamma F crystallin, were clearly distinguished by MS and electrophoretic mobility. Both were assigned to their respective genes, one of the polypeptides was reclassified as C57BL/6J gamma E crystallin. Building on these data and previous investigations an updated crystallin reference map was put forth and several non crystallin lenticular components were examined. These results represent the first part of a comprehensive investigation of the mouse lens proteome (http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE) with emphasis on understanding genetic effects on proteins and disease development.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In order to gain information about the effect triggered at the molecular level by nicotine, its neuroimmunomodulatory properties and its impact on the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, peripheral blood serum and leukocytes of rat submitted to passive nicotine administration were subjected to proteomic investigation. Serum, polymorphonuclear (PMN) and mononuclear (MN) leukocytes from chronically treated animals and from control animals were analysed by a two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis/mass spectrometry approach to detect differentially expressed proteins. The nicotine regimen selected is known to have a stimulatory effect on locomotor activity and to produce a sensitisation of the mesolimbic dopamine system mechanism involved in addiction development. After 2-D gel analysis and matching, 36 spots in serum, seven in PMN and five in MN were found to display a statistical difference in their expression and were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry peptide fingerprinting for protein identification. Fifteen different proteins were identified. The results indicate an overall impact of nicotine on proteins involved in a variety of cellular and metabolic pathways, including acute phase response (suggesting the effect on inflammatory cascades and more in general on the immune system), oxidative stress metabolism and assembly and regulation of cytoskeleton. In particular, the observed changes imply a general reduction in the inflammatory response with a concomitant increased unbalance of the oxidative stress metabolism in the periphery and point to a number of potential noninvasive markers for the central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS mediated activities of nicotine.

<ABSTRACT>
To identify the proteomic alterations associated with carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we compared the protein expression profiles of nine HCC cell lines with those of primary cultured hepatocytes established from five individuals. A differential proteomic study was performed by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis, in which protein samples are labeled with different fluorescent dyes and separated according to their isoelectric point and molecular weight. To label the protein samples, we used a newly developed and highly sensitive fluorescent dye, which reacts with all reduced cysteine residues of proteins. Principal component analysis based on the intensity of 1238 protein spots indicated that the HCC cells and the normal hepatocytes had distinct proteomic profiles. The Wilcoxon test was used to determine the protein spots whose intensity was differentially regulated in the HCC cells compared with the normal hepatocytes, and mass spectrometric analysis was used to identify the proteins corresponding to the spots. The proteins identified are involved in cell cycle regulation, binding to a tumor-suppressor gene product, fatty acid binding, and regulation of translation. Western blotting with specific antibodies revealed the overexpression of PCNA, EB1 and E-FABP in HCC tissues compared with noncancerous tissues. Aberrant regulation of EB1 and E-FABP has not previously been implicated in the development of HCC.

Proteomics. 2005 Feb;5(2):474-89.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have combined high-resolution two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry with the aim of identifying proteins represented in the 2-D gel database of the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster. First, we obtained a high-resolution 2-D gel pattern of [35S]methionine + [35S]cysteine-labeled polypeptides of Schneider cells, a permanent cell line of Drosophila embryonic origin, and compared it with the standard pattern of polypeptides of the wing imaginal disc. These studies reveal qualitative and quantitative differences between the two samples, but have more than 600 polypeptides in common. Second, we carried out preparative 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Schneider cells mixed with radioactively labeled wing imaginal discs in order to isolate some of the shared polypeptides and characterize them by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight MALDI-TOF analysis. Using this strategy we identified 100 shared proteins represented in the database, and in each case confirmed their identity by MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis.

Enhanced plasminogen activation by staphylokinase in the presence of
streptokinase beta/betagamma domains: plasminogen kringles play a role.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1565-72.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Presence of isolated beta or betagamma domains of streptokinase (SK) increased the catalytic activity of staphylokinase (SAK)-plasmin (Pm) complex up to 60%. In contrast, fusion of SK beta or betagamma domains with the C-terminal end of SAK drastically reduced the catalytic activity of the activator complex. The enhancement effect mediated by beta or betagamma domain on Pg activator activity of SAK-Pm complex was reduced greatly (45%) in the presence of isolated kringles of Pg, whereas, kringles did not change cofactor activity of SAK fusion proteins (carrying beta or betagamma domains) significantly. When catalytic activity of SAK-microPm (catalytic domain of Pm lacking kringle domains) complex was examined in the presence of isolated beta and betagamma domains, no enhancement effect on Pg activation was observed, whereas, enzyme complex formed between microplasmin and SAK fusion proteins (SAKbeta and SAKbetagamma) displayed 50-70% reduction in their catalytic activity. The present study, thus, suggests that the exogenously present beta and betagamma interact with Pg/Pm via kringle domains and elevate catalytic activity of SAK-Pm activator complex resulting in enhanced substrate Pg activation. Fusion of beta or betagamma domains with SAK might alter these intermolecular interactions resulting in attenuated functional activity of SAK.

Downregulated mRNA expression of ASPP and the hypermethylation of the

FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1587-90.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The p53 protein is one of the best-known tumour suppressors. Recently discovered ASPP1 and ASPP2 are specific activators of p53. To understand, if apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (ASPP) inactivation offers a selective advantage to tumors that have wild-type p53, we measured the mRNA expression of ASPP1 and ASPP2 in tumor cell lines retaining wide-type p53. In addition, the CpG island methylation status of ASPP1 gene and ASPP2 gene in the 5'-untranslated region was also investigated in order to understand the possible cause of abnormal expression of ASPP1 and ASPP2 in the tumor cell lines retaining wide-type p53. The data showed that mRNA expression of ASPP1 and ASPP2 is downregulated and CpG island tested is hypermethylated. These results indicated that ASPP CpG island aberrant methylation could be one molecular and genetic alteration in wild-type p53 tumours.

Inhibition of the angiogenesis by the MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1) binding peptide.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1597-601.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The CC chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), plays a crucial role in the initiation of atherosclerosis and has direct effects that promote angiogenesis. To develop a specific inhibitor for MCP-1-induced angiogenesis, we performed in vitro selection employing phage display random peptide libraries. Most of the selected peptides were found to be homologous to the second extracellular loops of CCR2 and CCR3. We synthesized the peptide encoding the homologous sequences of the receptors and tested its effect on the MCP-1 induced angiogenesis. Surface plasmon resonance measurements demonstrated specific binding of the peptide to MCP-1 but not to the other homologous protein, MCP-3. Flow cytometry revealed that the peptide inhibited the MCP-1 binding to THP-1 monocytes. Moreover, CAM and rat aortic ring assays showed that the peptide inhibited MCP-1 induced angiogenesis. Our observations indicate that the MCP-1-binding peptide exerts its anti-angiogenic effect by interfering with the interaction between MCP-1 and its receptor.

Docking and fusion of insulin secretory granules in SUR1 knock out mouse
beta-cells observed by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1602-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
To explore how the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) is involved in docking and fusion of insulin granules, dynamic motion of single insulin secretory granules near the plasma membrane was examined in SUR1 knock-out (Sur1KO) beta-cells by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Sur1KO beta-cells exhibited a marked reduction in the number of fusion events from previously docked granules. However, the number of docked granules declined during stimulation as a consequence of the release of docked granules into the cytoplasm vs. fusion with the plasma membrane. Thus, the impaired docking and fusion results in decreased insulin exocytosis from Sur1KO beta-cells.

The effect of calcium ions on subcellular localization of aldolase-FBPase
complex in skeletal muscle.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1607-12.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In skeletal muscles, FBPase-aldolase complex is located on alpha-actinin of the Z-line. In the present paper, we show evidence that stability of the complex is regulated by calcium ions. Real time interaction analysis, confocal microscopy and the protein exchange method have revealed that elevated calcium concentration decreases association constant of FBPase-aldolase and FBPase-alpha-actinin complex, causes fast dissociation of FBPase from the Z-line and slow accumulation of aldolase within the I-band and M-line. Therefore, the release of Ca2+ during muscle contraction might result, simultaneously, in the inhibition of glyconeogenesis and in the acceleration of glycolysis.

Red and far-red light alter the transcript profile in the cyanobacterium
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803: impact of cyanobacterial phytochromes.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1613-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cyanobacteria possess genes encoding phytochrome-related proteins. We used a DNA microarray approach to evaluate the impact of the phytochromes Cph1 and Cph2 on red light (R)- and far-red light (FR)-dependent gene expression in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In cells of wild-type and phytochrome mutants, one-fourth of all 3165 annotated putative protein encoding genes was light-responsive. R predominantly enhanced the expression of genes involved in transcription, translation, and photosynthesis, whereas FR upregulated the transcript level of genes known to be inducible by stress. The absence of Cph1 and/or Cph2 altered the light-dependent expression of about 20 genes. Hence, receptor(s) different from the two phytochromes are supposed to trigger the global R/FR alterations of the expression profile.

Comparative single-turnover kinetic analyses of trans-cleaving hammerhead
ribozymes with naturally derived non-conserved sequence motifs.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1619-24.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
trans-Cleaving hammerhead ribozyme variants were generated with mimicked non-conserved internal loop motifs derived from five structurally diverse natural cis-cleaving ribozymes. Most modified trans-cleaving variants showed enhanced single-turnover cleavage rates relative to minimal counterparts that lack tertiary interactions between internal loop motifs I and II, and relative to controls with sequence changes in loop I. The trans-cleaving ribozyme derived from the positive strand of peach latent mosaic viroid had the highest observed cleavage rate, suggesting a structurally optimized motif that facilitates rapid formation of the ribozyme catalytic center in a trans-reaction.

Matrix Mg2+ regulates mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channel from
heart.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1625-32.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Mitochondrial ATP-regulated potassium (mitoKATP) channels play an important role in cardioprotection. Single channel activity was measured after reconstitution of inner mitochondrial membranes from bovine myocardium into a planar lipid bilayer. After incorporation, the potassium channel was recorded with a mean conductance of 103+/-9 pS. The channel activity was inhibited by ATP/Mg and activated by GDP. Magnesium ions alone affected, in a dose dependent manner, both the channel conductance and the open probability. Magnesium ions regulated the mitoKATP channel only when added to the trans compartment. We conclude that Mg2+ regulates the cardiac mitoKATP channel from the matrix site by affecting both the channel conductance and gating.

<ABSTRACT>
The principles that govern the folding and packing of membrane proteins are still not completely understood. In the present work, we have revisited the glycophorin A (GpA) dimerisation motif that mediates transmembrane (TM) helix association, one of the best-suited models of membrane protein oligomerisation. By using artificial polyleucine TM segments we have demonstrated in this study that a pattern of only five amino acids (GVxxGVxxT) promotes specific dimerisation. Further, we have used this minimised GpA motif to assess the influence of hydrophobic matching on the TM helix packing process in detergent micelles and found that this factor modulates helix-helix association and/or dissociation between TM fragments.

Thyroid-hormone effects on putative biochemical pathways involved in UCP3
activation in rat skeletal muscle mitochondria.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1639-45.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In vitro, uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3)-mediated uncoupling requires cofactors [e.g., superoxides, coenzyme Q (CoQ) and fatty acids (FA)] or their derivatives, but it is not yet clear whether or how such activators interact with each other under given physiological or pathophysiological conditions. Since triiodothyronine (T3) stimulates lipid metabolism, UCP3 expression and mitochondrial uncoupling, we examined its effects on some biochemical pathways that may underlie UCP3-mediated uncoupling. T3-treated rats (Hyper) showed increased mitochondrial lipid-oxidation rates, increased expression and activity of enzymes involved in lipid handling and increased mitochondrial superoxide production and CoQ levels. Despite the higher mitochondrial superoxide production in Hyper, euthyroid and hyperthyroid mitochondria showed no differences in proton-conductance when FA were chelated by bovine serum albumin. However, mitochondria from Hyper showed a palmitoyl-carnitine-induced and GDP-inhibited increased proton-conductance in the presence of carboxyatractylate. We suggest that T3 stimulates the UCP3 activity in vivo by affecting the complex network of biochemical pathways underlying the UCP3 activation.

<ABSTRACT>
Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) have been proposed as mechanisms of cancer-induced cachexia. In this study, we assessed using Western blot analysis the levels of total protein carbonylation (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine assay), both malondialdehyde- (MDA-) and 2-hydroxy-4-nonenal- (HNE-) protein adducts, Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), catalase, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and 3-nitrotyrosine formation in gastrocnemius muscles of rats bearing the Yoshida AH-130 hepatoma. In the muscles of the tumour-bearing animals, protein carbonylation as measured by total levels of carbonyl group formation and both HNE and MDA-protein adducts, and protein tyrosine nitration were significantly greater than in control muscles. Protein levels of the antioxidant enzymes Mn-SOD, catalase, and HO-1 were not significantly modified in the rat cachectic muscles compared to controls. The inefficiency of the antioxidant enzymes in neutralizing excessive ROS production may account for elevated markers of protein oxidation and be responsible for the development of both oxidative and nitrosative stress in cancer-induced cachexia.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1653-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The effect of different classes of dietary polyphenols on intestinal glucose uptake was investigated using polarised Caco-2 intestinal cells. Glucose uptake into cells under sodium-dependent conditions was inhibited by flavonoid glycosides and non-glycosylated polyphenols whereas aglycones and phenolic acids were without effect. Under sodium-free conditions, aglycones and non-glycosylated polyphenols inhibited glucose uptake whereas glycosides and phenolic acids were ineffective. These data suggest that aglycones inhibit facilitated glucose uptake whereas glycosides inhibit the active transport of glucose. The non-glycosylated dietary polyphenols appear to exert their effects via steric hindrance, and (-)-epigallochatechingallate, (-)-epichatechingallate and (-)-epigallochatechin are effective against both transporters.

<ABSTRACT>
We have used bee venom phospholipase A2 as a vector to load human dendritic cells ex vivo with a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted epitope fused to its C-terminus. The fusion protein bound to human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and was internalized into early endosomes. In vitro immunization experiments showed that these dendritic cells were able to generate specific CD8 T cell lines against the epitope carried by the fusion protein. Cross-presentation did not require proteasome, transporter associated with antigen processing, or endosome proteases, but required newly synthesized MHC molecules. Comparison of the antigen presentation pathway observed in this study to that followed by other toxins used as vectors is discussed.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Tangeretin is a methoxyflavone from citrus fruits, which inhibits growth of human mammary cancer cells and cytolysis by natural killer cells. Attempting to unravel the flavonoid's action mechanism, we found that it inhibited extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent way. In human T47D mammary cancer cells this inhibition was optimally observed after priming with estradiol. The spectrum of the intracellular signalling kinase inhibition was narrow and comparison of structural congeners showed that inhibition of ERK phosphorylation was not unique for tangeretin. Our data add tangeretin to the list of small kinase inhibitors with a restricted intracellular inhibition profile.

Lithium inhibits brown adipocyte differentiation.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1670-4.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Lithium impairs the appearance of the characteristic morphology of brown adipocytes and downregulates the expression of marker genes of brown adipocyte differentiation. These effects are dose-dependent and are more pronounced when exposure of preadipocytes to lithium is initiated at early stages of differentiation. Although lithium reduces the expression of genes common to both white and brown adipocytes [fatty acid binding protein aP2 (aP2/FABP) or peroxisome proliferating activated receptor gamma], genes expressed differentially in brown adipocytes, i.e., uncoupling protein 1, PPAR gamma coactivator-1alpha, and peroxisome proliferating activated receptor alpha, are particularly sensitive to lithium treatment-dependent downregulation. Brown adipocytes appear as preferential targets of the inhibitory action of lithium on adipocyte differentiation.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Olfactory cilia contain cyclic nucleotide-gated and Ca2+-dependent Cl- conductances that underlie excitatory chemotransduction, and a Ca2+-dependent K+ (KCa) conductance, apparently involved in inhibitory transduction. Previous single-channel patch-clamp studies on olfactory cilia revealed four different KCas, with different conductances and kinetics. Here, we further characterized these channels in planar bilayers, where blockers could be properly tested. All four ciliary KCas were observed: The 16 pS channel, K0.5,Ca=40 microM and apamin-sensitive; the 30 and 50 pS channel, K0.5,Ca=59 microM, clotrimazole-sensitive and charybdotoxin-insensitive; the 60 pS channel, clotrimazole-sensitive and charybdotoxin-insensitive; and the 210 pS channel, K0.5,Ca=63 microM, blocked by charybdotoxin and iberiotoxin. The presence of the 16 and 210 pS channels was confirmed by immunoblotting.

Amino acid residues 62 and 193 play the key role in regulating the
synergism of substrate binding in oyster arginine kinase.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1688-92.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The purpose of this study is to clarify the amino acid residues responsible for the synergism in substrate binding of arginine kinase (AK), a key enzyme in invertebrate energy metabolism. AKs contain a pair of highly conserved amino acids (D62 and R193) that form an ion pair, and replacement of these residues can cause a pronounced loss of activity. Interestingly, in the oyster Crassostrea AK, these residues are replaced by an N and a K, respectively. Despite this replacement, the enzyme retains high activity and moderate synergism in substrate binding (Kd/Km=2.3). We replaced the N62 by G or D and the K193 by G or R in Crassostrea AK, and also constructed the double mutants of N62G/K193G and N62D/K193R. All of the mutants retained 50-90% of the wild-type activity. In N62G and N62D mutants, the Kmarg for arginine binding was comparable to that of wild-type enzyme, but the Kdarg was increased 2-5-fold, resulting in a strong synergism (Kd/Km=4.9-11.3). On the other hand, in K193G and K193R mutants, the Kmarg was increased 4-fold, and synergism was lost almost completely (Kd/Km=1.0-1.4). The N62G/K193G double mutant showed similar characteristics to the K193G and K193R mutants. Another double mutant, N62D/K193R, similar to the amino acid pair in the wild-type enzyme, had characteristics similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. These results indicate that the amino acid residues 62 and 193 play the key role in mediating the synergism in substrate binding of oyster arginine kinase.

Visualisation of nano-scale biomolecules aids understanding and development in molecular biology and nanotechnology. Detailed structure of nucleosomes adsorbed to mica has been captured in the absence of chemical-anchoring techniques, demonstrating the usefulness of non-contact atomic force microscopy (NC-AFM) for ultra-high resolution biomolecular imaging. NC-AFM offers significant advantages in terms of resolution, speed and ease of sample preparation when compared to techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography. In the absence of chemical modification, detailed structure of DNA deposited on a gold substrate was observed for the first time using NC-AFM, opening up possibilities for investigating the electrical properties of unmodified DNA.

<ABSTRACT>
The potential use of alpha-cyclodextrin and its hydrophilic alpha-cyclodextrin derivatives (alpha-CyDs) as antagonists against lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which stimulates the nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production as well as nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in macrophages was examined. Of three alpha-CyDs used in the present study, 2,6-di-O-methyl-alpha-CyD (DM-alpha-CyD) had greater inhibitory activity than did the other CyDs against NO and TNF-alpha production through an impairment of gene expression in macrophage cell lines and primary macrophages stimulated with LPS and lipid A in a concentration-dependent manner. Concomitantly, DM-alpha-CyD inhibited NF-kappaB translocation into nucleus. These inhibitory effects of DM-alpha-CyD could be attributed to the release of CD14 from lipid rafts caused by an efflux of phospholipids, but not cholesterol. These results suggest that DM-alpha-CyD may have promise as a potent and unique antagonist for excess activation of macrophages stimulated with LPS.

<ABSTRACT>
The mouse polymerase delta-interacting protein 1 gene, PDIP1, is mapped to chromosome 7F3 region, spans approximately 16.7kb, and is organized into six exons. The transcription start site (TSS) was determined to be G, corresponding to position of 162-bp upstream of the translation start codon. The promoter region was found to lack TATA box or CCAAT box, instead, a CpG island was detected surrounding TSS. The region from -162 to +114 is required for basal transcriptional regulation of mouse PDIP1 gene, contains two AP-2 and two Sp1 binding sites. The Sp1 site upstream of TSS activates, while the other Sp1 site and two AP-2 sites suppress the transcription activity of mouse PDIP1 gene.

Potassium uptake defective Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (Deltatrk1,2 and Deltatrk1,2 Deltatok1) were used for the phenotypic analysis of the mouse inward rectifying Kir2.1 channel by growth analysis. Functional expression of both, multi-copy plasmid and chromosomally expressed GFP-mKir2.1 fusion constructs complemented the potassium uptake deficient phenotype in a pHout dependent manner. Upon application of Hygromycin B to chromosomally mKir2.1 expressing cells, significantly lower toxin sensitivity (EC50 15.4 microM) compared to Deltatrk1,2 Deltatok1 cells (EC50 2.6 microM) was observed. Growth determination of mKir2.1 expressing strains upon application of Ag+, Cs+ and Ba2+ as known blockers of mKir2.1 channels revealed significantly decreased channel function. Cells with mKir2.1 were about double sensitive to AgNO3, 350-fold more sensitive to CsCl and 1500-fold more sensitive to BaCl2 in comparison to the respective controls indicating functional expression and correct pharmacology.

Expression profiling of the estrogen responsive genes in response to
phytoestrogens using a customized DNA microarray.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1732-40.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Here, we examined phytoestrogens, isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, glycitein, biochanin A and ipriflavone), flavones (chrysin, luteolin and apigenin), flavonols (kaempferol and quercetin), and a coumestan, a flavanone and a chalcone (coumestrol, naringenin and phloretin, respectively) by means of a DNA microarray assay. A total of 172 estrogen responsive genes were monitored with a customized DNA microarray and their expression profiles for the above phytoestrogens were compared with that for 17beta-estradiol (E2) using correlation coefficients, or R values, after a correlation analysis by linear regression. While R values indicate the similarity of the response by the genes, we also examined the genes by cluster analysis and by their specificity to phytoestrogens (specific to genistein, daidzein or glycitein) or gene functions. Several genes were selected from p53-related genes (CDKN1A, TP53I11 and CDC14), Akt2-related genes (PRKCD, BRCA1, TRIB3 and APPL), mitogen-activated protein kinase-related genes (RSK and SH3BP5), Ras superfamily genes (RAP1GA1, RHOC and ARHGDIA) and AP-1 family and related genes (RIP140, FOS, ATF3, JUN and FRA2). We further examined the extracts from two local crops of soy beans (Kuro-daizu or Mochi-daizu) by comparing the gene expression profiles with those of E2 or phytoestrogens as a first step in utilizing the expression profiles for various applications.

Direct interaction of coenzyme M with the active-site Fe-S cluster of
heterodisulfide reductase.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1741-4.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Heterodisulfide reductase (HDR) catalyzes the formation of coenzyme M (CoM-SH) and coenzyme B (CoB-SH) by the reversible reduction of the heterodisulfide, CoM-S-S-CoB. This reaction recycles the two thiol coenzymes involved in the final step of microbial methanogenesis. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and variable-temperature magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopic experiments on oxidized HDR incubated with CoM-SH revealed a S=1/2 [4Fe-4S]3) cluster, the EPR spectrum of which is broadened in the presence of CoM-33SH [Duin, E.C., Madadi-Kahkesh, S., Hedderich, R., Clay, M.D. and Johnson, M.K. (2002) Heterodisulfide reductase from Methanothermobacter marburgensis contains an active-site [4Fe-4S] cluster that is directly involved in mediating heterodisulfide reduction. FEBS Lett. 512, 263-268; Duin, E.C., Bauer, C., Jaun, B. and Hedderich, R. (2003) Coenzyme M binds to a [4Fe-4S] cluster in the active site of heterodisulfide reductase as deduced from EPR studies with the [33S]coenzyme M-treated enzyme. FEBS Lett. 538, 81-84]. These results provide indirect evidence that the disulfide binds to the iron-sulfur cluster during reduction. We report here direct structural evidence for this interaction from Se X-ray absorption spectroscopic investigation of HDR treated with the selenium analog of coenzyme M (CoM-SeH). Se K edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure confirms a direct interaction of the Se in CoM-SeH-treated HDR with an Fe atom of the Fe-S cluster at an Fe-Se distance of 2.4A.

Dictyostelium discoideum requires an Alix/AIP1 homolog, DdAlix, for
morphogenesis in alkaline environments.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1745-50.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Alix and its homologs are involved in various phenomena such as endosomal protein-sorting and adaptation to stress conditions. In this study, we found that development of Dictyostelium discoideum Alix (DdAlix) deletion mutant (alx-) cells was impaired in alkaline pH environments. The fruiting body formation efficiency of alx- cells at pH 9.0 was significantly lower than that of wild-type cells (6.8+/-4.2% vs 93+/-6.3%). The alkaline-sensitive phenotype of alx- cells was rescued by addition of salt. The phenotype was rescued by exogenous expression of human Alix as well as DdAlix but not by that of either Saccharomyces cerevisiae Alix homolog Rim20 or Bro1. DdAlix may be, structurally and functionally, more related to human Alix than to yeast Rim20 and Bro1.

Formation of ceramide-enriched domains in lipid particles enhances the
binding of apolipoprotein E.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1759-64.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We investigated the interaction between apolipoprotein E (apoE) and ceramide (CER)-enriched domains on the particles, by using lipid emulsions containing sphingomyelin (SM) or CER as model particles of lipoproteins. The sphingomyelinase (SMase)-induced aggregation of emulsion particles was prevented by apoE. CER increased the amount of apoE bound to emulsion particles. The confocal images of CER-containing large emulsions with two fluorescent probes showed three-dimensional microdomains enriched in CER. SMase also induced the formation of CER-enriched domains. We propose apoE prefers to bind on CER-enriched domains exposed on particle surface, and thus inhibits the aggregation or fusion of the particles.

Inhibition of beta-oxidative respiration is a therapeutic window

FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 14;579(7):1765-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We demonstrate expression and coordinate induction of PPARgamma and lipogenic enzymes (HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase and fatty acid synthase) in a murine lung alveolar carcinoma cell line (Line 1) treated with the PPARgamma agonist troglitazone (TRO) [0-100 microM]. We postulate that TRO induces a shift in cellular energy metabolism towards fatty acid oxidation (beta-oxidative respiration). Accordingly, co-treatment with TRO [30 microM] and increasing concentrations of trimetazidine (TMZ) [0.1-3 mM], an inhibitor of beta-oxidation, results in a dose dependent decrease cellular ATP levels and a dose dependent induction of apoptosis. These findings, suggest that inhibition of beta-oxidative respiration is a therapeutic window associated with the cancer chemo-preventive activity of PPARgamma agonists.

Effective depletion of albumin using a new peptide-based affinity medium.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):973-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Blood plasma and serum are very useful samples for the detection, identification and quantitation of proteins associated with both health and disease. However, analysis of plasma and serum is a challenge because traces of interesting polypeptides and proteins can be dominated by the very high concentration of albumin present. Albumin may be depleted by adsorption to immunoaffinity columns or to columns containing dyes such as Cibacron Blue, or by ultrafiltration, but these methods are far from ideal. We describe a new peptide-based affinity medium which is effective for removing albumin and is very specific. The albumin-binding capacity is at least 14 mg per mL of gel. The material may be reused hundreds of times after a simple regeneration step involving NaOH, with full retention of specificity and capacity. The material was tested with human and monkey plasma and serum and rat serum, and has been used to deplete litre volumes of human plasma. The development of other peptide-based affinity media to deplete abundant proteins is briefly discussed.

Tryptic transpeptidation products observed in proteome analysis by liquid

Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):846-52.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Commonly, prior to mass spectrometry based analysis of proteins or protein mixtures, the proteins are subjected to specific enzymatic proteolysis. For this purpose trypsin is most frequently used. However, the process of proteolysis is not unflawed. For example, some side activities of trypsin are known and have already been described in the literature (e.g., chymotryptic activity). Here, we describe the occurrence of transpeptidated peptides during standard proteome analysis using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometric protein identification. Different types of transpeptidated peptides have been detected. The most frequently observed transpeptidation reaction is N-terminal addition of arginine or lysine to peptides. Furthermore, addition of two amino acids to the N-terminus of a peptide has also been detected. Another transpeptidation that we observed, is combination of two peptides, which were originally located in different regions of the analyzed protein. Currently, the full amount of peptides generated by transpeptidation is not clear. However, it should be recognized that protein information is presently lost as these effects are not detectable with available database search software.

Global protein expression analysis in apicomplexan parasites: current
status.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):918-24.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Members of the phylum Apicomplexa are important protozoan parasites that cause some of the most serious, and in some cases, deadly diseases in humans and animals. They include species from the genus Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Eimeria, Neospora, Cryptosporidium, Babesia and Theileria. The medical, veterinary and economic impact of these pathogens on a global scale is enormous. Although chemo- and immuno-prophylactic strategies are available to control some of these parasites, they are inadequate. Currently, there is an urgent need to design new vaccines or chemotherapeutics for apicomplexan diseases. High-throughput global protein expression analyses using gel or non-gel based protein separation technologies coupled with mass spectrometry and bioinformatics provide a means to identify new drug and vaccine targets in these pathogens. Protein identification based proteomic projects in apicomplexan parasites is currently underway, with the most significant progress made in the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. More recently, preliminary two-dimensional gel electrophoresis maps of Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum tachyzoites and Eimeria tenella sporozoites, have been produced, as well as for micronemes in E. tenella. In this review, the status of proteomics in the analysis of global protein expression in apicomplexan parasites will be compared and the challenges associated with these investigations discussed.

Biochemical and immunological studies of nucleocapsid proteins of severe
acute respiratory syndrome and 229E human coronaviruses.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):925-37.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a serious health threat and its early diagnosis is important for infection control and potential treatment of the disease. Diagnostic tools require rapid and accurate methods, of which a capture ELISA method may be useful. Toward this goal, we have prepared and characterized soluble full-length nucleocapsid proteins (N protein) from SARS and 229E human coronaviruses. N proteins form oligomers, mostly as dimers at low concentration. These two N proteins degrade rapidly upon storage and the major degraded N protein is the C-terminal fragment of amino acid (aa) 169-422. Taken together with other data, we suggest that N protein is a two-domain protein, with the N-terminal aa 50-150 as the RNA-binding domain and the C-terminal aa 169-422 as the dimerization domain. Polyclonal antibodies against the SARS N protein have been produced and the strong binding sites of the anti-nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibodies produced were mapped to aa 1-20, aa 150-170 and aa 390-410. These sites are generally consistent with those mapped by sera obtained from SARS patients. The SARS anti-NP antibody was able to clearly detect SARS virus grown in Vero E6 cells and did not cross-react with the NP from the human coronavirus 229E. We have predicted several antigenic sites (15-20 amino acids) of S, M and N proteins and produced antibodies against those peptides, some of which could be recognized by sera obtained from SARS patients. Antibodies against the NP peptides could detect the cognate N protein clearly. Further refinement of these antibodies, particularly large-scale production of monoclonal antibodies, could lead to the development of useful diagnostic kits for diseases associated with SARS and other human coronaviruses.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignancy of both underdeveloped and developing countries. Proteomes of ten pairs of clinical hepatitis B virus associated HCC tissue samples were obtained by high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Comprehensive analyses of proteins associated with B-type HCC were focused on total differentially expressed proteins (> or = two-fold increase or decrease, Student's t-test, p < 0.05) from one pair of samples. Protein identification was done by peptide mass fingerprinting with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Comparative analyses of proteins associated with B-type HCC included repeat statistics in ten cases. A total of 100 protein spots, corresponding to 80 different gene products, were identified. Proteins whose expression levels were different by more than 2-fold in at least 50% of the cases (five of ten cases) were further analyzed and 45 proteins were selected out as candidates for HCC-associated proteins. Western blotting further validated up-regulated expressions of two candidate proteins in tumor tissues: proliferating cell antigen and stathmin 1. This comprehensive and comparative analyses of proteins associated with B-type HCC could provide useful molecular markers for diagnostics and prognostics and for therapeutic targets. The physiological significance of the differential expressions for several candidate proteins are discussed.

Identification of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 as the

Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):1160-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
MG7 is an early gastrointestinal cancer specific monoclonal antibody. It can detect gastric cancer with high sensitivity and specificity. However, the target antigen for MG7 has not been identified. Western blot analysis revealed that the MG7 antibody reproducibly recognized two approximately 35 kDa proteins in the total cell lysates of human gastric carcinoma cell lines KATO III and MKN-45. Using a proteomic approach, we identified these MG7 immunoreactive proteins as the human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNP A2/B1). Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytosolic fraction of KATO III cells using either MG7 or hnRNP A2/B1 antibodies confirmed that the target antigen is located exclusively in the nucleus. With the use of archival samples, we also found that the level of hnRNP A2/B1 protein was increased in gastric cancer tissues (4 out of 5 patients), when compared to their corresponding matching normal stomach tissue.

Differential protein expression in human gliomas and molecular insights.

Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):1167-77.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Gliomas are the most common of the primary intracranial tumors with astrocytomas constituting about 40%. Using clinically and histologically assessed astrocytomas, we have studied their protein profiles using a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-mass spectrometry approach and identified differentially expressed proteins which may be useful molecular indicators to understand these tumors. Examination of the protein profiles of 27 astrocytoma samples of different grades revealed 72 distinct, differentially expressed proteins belonging to various functional groups such as cytoskeleton and intermediate filament proteins, heat shock proteins (HSPs), enzymes and regulatory proteins. Based on the consistency of their differential expression, 29 distinct proteins could be short-listed and may have a role in the pathology of astrocytomas. Some were found to be differentially expressed in both Grade III and IV astrocytomas while others were associated with a particular grade. A notable observation was underexpression of Prohibitin, a potential tumor suppressor protein, Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor, Rho-GDI, a regulator of Rho GTPases and HSPs as well as destabilization of glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP, major protein of the glial filaments, in Grade III malignant tumors. We attempt to explain glioma malignancy and progression in terms of their combined role.

<ABSTRACT>
Extended from the peptide mapping method (Fenyo, D., Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000, 11, 391-395) the proposed algorithm takes the mass information of a precursor ion to reconstruct all possible phosphorylated peptide sequences. The mass spectra of product ions from the corresponding precursor ion is then used and compared to the reconstructed sequences to deduce the most probable phosphoprotein. The proposed algorithm also predicts all possible combinations of phosphopeptides, which may serve as a clue for designing proper phosphorylation experiments to validate the existence of these peptides and the corresponding proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Identification of protein complexes is the key to understanding cellular functions. In this study, we present a novel method for the identification of multiprotein complexes from mammalian cells. By using the Strep-tag affinity chromatography method, enabling fast and simple one-step purification, coupled with competitive elution under physiological conditions, we successfully purified a PP2A holoenzyme protein complex from a cultured mammalian cancer cell line. We identified, by mass spectrometry, both known and novel interacting proteins for PP2A, and demonstrate that the purified PP2A complex is functional. The benefits and potential applications of the Strep-tag method for protein complex purification are discussed.

Heat shock proteins and other components of cellular machinery for protein

factor-activated human endothelial cells.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(5):1217-27.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteome analysis of human umbilical endothelial cells was performed to identify proteins that are modified during vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF)-induced transition from the quiescent into the proliferating-migrative phenotype. Subtractive analysis of two-dimensional gel patterns of human endothelial cells, before and after stimulation with VEGF(165), revealed differences in 85 protein spots. All proteins were identified by peptide sequencing and peptide mass fingerprinting using an electrospray spectrometer. The proteins identified were members of specific families including Ca(2+)-binding proteins, fatty-acid binding proteins, structural proteins, and chaperones. Remarkably, there was a massive activation of cellular machinery for both protein synthesis and protein degradation. Thus, among up-regulated proteins there were members of all groups of heat shock proteins (HSPs; HSP 27, HSP 60, HSP 70p5, HSP 70p8, HSP 90, and HSP 96) and some other proteins showing either chaperone activity or which participate in assembly of multimolecular structures (TCP-1, desmoplakins, junction plakoglobin, GRP 94, thioredoxin related protein, and peptidylprolyl isomerase). The increased expression of HSPs was confirmed at the mRNA level at different stages of treatment with VEGF. Similarly, components of the proteolytic machinery for the degradation of misfolded proteins (ER-60, cathepsin D, proteasome subunits, and protease inhibitor 6) were also up-regulated. On the other hand, changes in the expression of structural proteins (T-plastin, vimentin, alpha tubulin, actin, and myosin) could account, at least in part, for the different morphologies displayed by migrating endothelial cells. In summary, our data show that VEGF levels similar to those during physiological stresses induce a number of genes and multiple endogenous pathways seem to be engaged in restoring cellular homeostasis. To ensure cell survival, the molecular chaperones (the heat shock family of stress proteins) are highly up-regulated providing protein-folding machinery to repair or degrade misfolded proteins.

Saturation labeling with cysteine-reactive cyanine fluorescent dyes
provides increased sensitivity for protein expression profiling of
laser-microdissected clinical specimens.

<ABSTRACT>
Laser capture microdissection (LCM) provides the capability to isolate and analyze small numbers of cells from a specific area of a histologic section. LCM has particular value for analysis of early stage tumors, which are often small and intermixed with non-tumor tissue. It has previously been shown that a new generation of cysteine-reactive cyanine dyes can, in principle, provide increased sensitivity for two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) profiling when sample quantitities are limiting. However, the comparative advantage of the new dyes in a clinical setting has not been established. Here, we report that cysteine-reactive dyes allowed the identification of more features than established, lysine-reactive dyes with a given number of cells. This was true both with extracts prepared from human papillomavirus E6 and E7-transduced human keratinocytes, a model for early-stage cervical cancer, and with LCM samples. In an experiment comparing LCM clinical samples of gastric adenocarcinoma versus precancerous, spasmolytic polypeptide expressing metaplasia (SPEM) from the same patient, cysteine labeling allowed the identification of more than 1000 discrete protein spots in samples containing 5000 cells. This is a 5- to 50-fold smaller sample than used in previous studies. Both labeling methods had a comparable success rate for protein identification by mass spectrometry (MS). The proteins associated with more than 40 differentially abundant spots in the clinical samples were identified by MS. In this exploratory analysis, changes in expression levels of cytoskeletal proteins, molecular chaperones, and cell-signaling proteins were seen. The identification of a number of proteins that are potentially relevant to tumor progression suggests that the method holds promise for biomarker discovery.

Ampicillin/penicillin-binding protein interactions as a model drug-target

for target and pathway identification.

Proteomics. 2005 May;5(7):1764-73.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The identification and validation of the targets of active compounds identified in cell-based assays is an important step in preclinical drug development. New analytical approaches that combine drug affinity pull-down assays with mass spectrometry (MS) could lead to the identification of new targets and druggable pathways. In this work, we investigate a drug-target system consisting of ampicillin- and penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) to evaluate and compare different amino-reactive resins for the immobilization of the affinity compound and mass spectrometric methods to identify proteins from drug affinity pull-down assays. First, ampicillin was immobilized onto various amino-reactive resins, which were compared in the ampicillin-PBP model with respect to their nonspecific binding of proteins from an Escherichia coli membrane extract. Dynal M-270 magnetic beads were chosen to further study the system as a model for capturing and identifying the targets of ampicillin, PBPs that were specifically and covalently bound to the immobilized ampicillin. The PBPs were identified, after in situ digestion of proteins bound to ampicillin directly on the beads, by using either one-dimensional (1-D) or two-dimensional (2-D) liquid chromatography (LC) separation techniques followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis. Alternatively, an elution with N-lauroylsarcosine (sarcosyl) from the ampicillin beads followed by in situ digestion and 2-D LC-MS/MS analysis identified proteins potentially interacting noncovalently with the PBPs or the ampicillin. The in situ approach required only little time, resources, and sample for the analysis. The combination of drug affinity pull-down assays with in situ digestion and 2-D LC-MS/MS analysis is a useful tool in obtaining complex information about a primary drug target as well as its protein interactors.

<ABSTRACT>
We describe the use of commercially available microcentrifugation devices (spin filters) for cleanup and digestion of protein samples for mass spectrometry analyses. The protein sample is added to the upper chamber of a spin filter with a > or = 3000 molecular weight cutoff membrane and then washed prior to resuspension in ammonium bicarbonate. The protein is then reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin in the upper chamber and the peptides are recovered by centrifugation through the membrane. The method provides digestion efficiencies comparable to standard in-solution digests, avoids lengthy dialysis steps, and allows rapid cleanup of samples containing salts, some detergents, and acidic or basic buffers.

High sequence coverage by in-capillary proteolysis of native proteins and

<ABSTRACT>
Losses of proteolytic peptides during extraction and/or purification procedures succeeding in-gel or in-solution digests of proteins frequently occur in the course of protein identification investigations. In order to overcome this disadvantage, the method of in-capillary digest was developed: native proteins were incubated in the presence of endoproteases in the electrospray capillary and the resulting peptides were analyzed by nanoelectrospray-mass spectrometry during the ongoing proteolysis. In-capillary digest of apomyglobin by use of trypsin in a molar ratio of 25:1 yielded complete degradation already after 15 min. The sequence coverage based on formation of molecular ions was 100% and peptide ions could be fragmented by collision-induced dissociation and sequenced. When myoglobin was incubated in the electrospray capillary with trypsin in a molar ratio of 500:1, a clear shift from molecular ions and miscleaved peptide ions to the expected final tryptic peptide ions was observed over a 2 h period. The peptide spectra obtained from tryptic in-capillary proteolysis of bovine serum albumin and apotransferrin, respectively, gave rise to sequence coverages of more than 40% for both proteins. The data obtained from the peptide maps as well as from collision-induced dissociation (CID) of selected peptides were more than sufficient for protein identification by database searches. An elephant milk protein preparation was used to demonstrate the application of in-capillary proteolysis on protein mixtures. Tryptic digest, simultaneous analysis of the proteolytic peptides by use of CID, and subsequent sequencing allowed the identification of lactoferrin, alphas1-casein, beta-casein, delta-casein, and kappa-casein by homology search.

<ABSTRACT>
The aim of this study was to analyze the type of immune response (Th1, Th2) and protein composition of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients with sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Flow cytometry analysis of intracellular cytokines revealed different patterns: in IPF and SSc Th2 profiles were predominant, whereas in sarcoidosis Th1 prevailed. The proteomic analysis of BAL fluid (BALF) showed that there were quantitative differences between the three diseases. These were more evident between sarcoidosis and IPF, confirming our previous observations, whereas SSc had an intermediate profile between the two, however with some peculiarities. Comparison of BALF protein maps, constructed with the same quantity of total proteins, enabled us to identify the main profiles of the three diseases: an increase in plasma protein prevalent in sarcoidosis and also present in SSc, though for fewer proteins with respect to IPF and a greater abundance of low molecular weight proteins, mainly locally produced, in IPF. These findings are in line with the different pathogenesis of these diseases: IPF is considered a prevalently fibrotic disorder limited to the lung, with intense local production of functionally different proteins, whereas sarcoidosis and SSc are systemic immunoinflammatory diseases.

Lipoproteomics II: mapping of proteins in high-density lipoprotein using
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(5):1431-45.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is the most abundant lipoprotein particle in the plasma and a negative risk factor of atherosclerosis. By using a proteomic approach it is possible to obtain detailed information about its protein content and protein modifications that may give new information about the physiological roles of HDL. In this study the two subfractions; HDL(2) and HDL(3), were isolated by two-step discontinuous density-gradient ultracentrifugation and the proteins were separated with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified with peptide mass fingerprinting, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry. Identified proteins in HDL were: the dominating apo A-I as six isoforms, four of them with a glycosylation pattern and one of them with retained propeptide, apolipoprotein (apo) A-II, apo A-IV, apo C-I, apo C-II, apo C-III (two isoforms), apo E (five isoforms), the recently discovered apo M (two isoforms), serum amyloid A (two isoforms) and serum amyloid A-IV (six isoforms). Furthermore, alpha-1-antitrypsin was identified in HDL for the first time. Additionally, salivary alpha-amylase was identified as two isoforms in HDL(2), and apo L and a glycosylated apo A-II were identified in HDL(3). Besides confirming the presence of different apolipoproteins, this study indicates new patterns of glycosylated apo A-I and apo A-II. Furthermore, the study reveals new proteins in HDL; alpha-1-antitrypsin and salivary alpha-amylase. Further investigations about these proteins may give new insight into the functional role of HDL in coronary artery diseases.

Robustness, evolvability, and neutrality.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 21;579(8):1772-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Biological systems, from macromolecules to whole organisms, are robust if they continue to function, survive, or reproduce when faced with mutations, environmental change, and internal noise. I focus here on biological systems that are robust to mutations and ask whether such systems are more or less evolvable, in the sense that they can acquire novel properties. The more robust a system is, the more mutations in it are neutral, that is, without phenotypic effect. I argue here that such neutral change--and thus robustness--can be a key to future evolutionary innovation, if one accepts that neutrality is not an essential feature of a mutation. That is, a once neutral mutation may cause phenotypic effects in a changed environment or genetic background. I argue that most, if not all, neutral mutations are of this sort, and that the essentialist notion of neutrality should be abandoned. This perspective reconciles two opposing views on the forces dominating organismal evolution, natural selection and random drift: neutral mutations occur and are especially abundant in robust systems, but they do not remain neutral indefinitely, and eventually become visible to natural selection, where some of them lead to evolutionary innovations.

Genome semantics, in silico multicellular systems and the Central Dogma.

<ABSTRACT>
Genomes with their complexity and size present what appears to be an impossible challenge. Scientists speak in terms of decades or even centuries before we will understand how genomes and their hosts the cell and the city of cells that make up the multicellular context function. We believe that there will be surprisingly quick progress made in our understanding of genomes. The key is to stop taking the Central Dogma as the only direction in which genome research can scale the semantics of genomes. Instead a top-down approach coupled with a bottom-up approach may snare the unwieldy beast and make sense of genomes. The method we propose is to take in silico biology seriously. By developing in silico models of genomes cells and multicellular systems, we position ourselves to develop a theory of meaning for artificial genomes. Then using that develop a natural semantics of genomes.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 21;579(8):1783-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
How cells utilize intracellular spatial features to optimize their signaling characteristics is still not clearly understood. The physical distance between the cell-surface receptor and the gene expression machinery, fast reactions, and slow protein diffusion coefficients are some of the properties that contribute to their intricacy. This article reviews computational frameworks that can help biologists to elucidate the implications of space in signaling pathways. We argue that intracellular macromolecular crowding is an important modeling issue, and describe how recent simulation methods can reproduce this phenomenon in either implicit, semi-explicit or fully explicit representation.

<ABSTRACT>
Recent technological and theoretical advances are only now allowing the simulation of detailed kinetic models of biological systems that reflect the stochastic movement and reactivity of individual molecules within cellular compartments. The behavior of many systems could not be properly understood without this level of resolution, opening up new perspectives of using computer simulations to accelerate biological research. We review the modeling methodology applied to stochastic spatial models, also to the attention of non-expert potential users. Modeling choices, current limitations and perspectives of improvement of current general-purpose modeling/simulation platforms for biological systems are discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
DNA Microarrays are used to simultaneously measure the levels of thousands of mRNAs in a sample. We illustrate here that a collection of such measurements in different cell types and states is a sound source of functional predictions, provided the microarray experiments are analogous and the cell samples are appropriately diverse. We have used this approach to study stem cells, whose identity and mechanisms of control are not well understood, generating Affymetrix microarray data from more than 200 samples, including stem cells and their derivatives, from human and mouse. The data can be accessed online (StemBase; http://www.scgp.ca:8080/StemBase/).

<ABSTRACT>
To understand a biological process it is clear that a single approach will not be sufficient, just like a single measurement on a protein--such as its expression level--does not describe protein function. Using reference sets of proteins as benchmarks different approaches can be scaled and integrated. Here, we demonstrate the power of data re-analysis and integration by applying it in a case study to data from deletion phenotype screens and mRNA expression profiling.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
During the last decades, biology has decomposed cellular systems into genetic, functional and molecular networks. It has become evident that these networks consist of components with specific functions (e.g., proteins and genes). This has generated a considerable amount of knowledge and hypotheses concerning cellular organization. The idea discussed here is to test the extent of this knowledge by reconstructing, or reverse engineering, new synthetic biological systems from known components. We will discuss how integration of computational methods with proteomics and engineering concepts might lead us to a deeper and more abstract understanding of signal transduction systems. Designing and successfully introducing synthetic proteins into cellular pathways would provide us with a powerful research tool with many applications, such as development of biosensors, protein drugs and rewiring of biological pathways.

<ABSTRACT>
Pathway information is vital for successful quantitative modeling of biological systems. The almost 170 online pathway databases vary widely in coverage and representation of biological processes, making their use extremely difficult. Future pathway information systems for querying, visualization and analysis must support standard exchange formats to successfully integrate data on a large scale. Such integrated systems will greatly facilitate the constructive cycle of computational model building and experimental verification that lies at the heart of systems biology.

<ABSTRACT>
A system-level understanding of any biological process requires a map of the relationships among the various molecules involved. Technologies to detect and predict protein interactions have begun to produce very large maps of protein interactions, some including most of an organism's proteins. These maps can be used to study how proteins work together to form molecular machines and regulatory pathways. They also provide a framework for constructing predictive models of how information and energy flow through biological networks. In many respects, protein interaction maps are an entree into systems biology.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 21;579(8):1828-33.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The behavior, morphology and response to stimuli in biological systems are dictated by the interactions between their components. These interactions, as we observe them now, are therefore shaped by genetic variations and selective pressure. Similar to what has been achieved by comparing genome structures and protein sequences, we hope to obtain valuable information about systems' evolution by comparing the organization of interaction networks and by analyzing their variation and conservation. Equally, significantly we can learn whether and how to extend the network information obtained experimentally in well-characterized model systems to different organisms. We conclude from our analysis that, despite the recent completion of several high throughput experiments aimed at the description of complete interactomes, the available interaction information is not yet of sufficient coverage and quality to draw any biologically meaningful conclusion from the comparison of different interactomes. Thus, the transfer of network information obtained from simple organism to evolutionary distant species should be carried out and considered with caution. By using smaller higher-confidence datasets, a larger fraction of interactions is shown to be conserved; this suggests that with the development of more accurate experimental and informatic approaches, we will soon be in the position to study the network evolution.

<ABSTRACT>
A long-term goal of the field of interactome modeling is to understand how global and local properties of complex macromolecular networks impact on observable biological properties, and how changes in such properties can lead to human diseases. The information available at this stage of development of the field provides strong evidence for the existence of such interesting global and local properties, but also demonstrates that many more datasets will be needed to provide accurate models with increasingly predictive capacity. This review focuses on an early attempt at mapping a multicellular interactome network and on the lessons learned from that attempt.

Variation and evolution of biomolecular systems: searching for functional

<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 21;579(8):1839-45.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The availability of genome sequences and functional genomics data from multiple species enables us to compare the composition of biomolecular systems like biochemical pathways and protein complexes between species. Here, we review small- and large-scale, "genomics-based" approaches to biomolecular systems variation. In general, caution is required when comparing the results of bioinformatics analyses of genomes or of functional genomics data between species. Limitations to the sensitivity of sequence analysis tools and the noisy nature of genomics data tend to lead to systematic overestimates of the amount of variation. Nevertheless, the results from detailed manual analyses, and of large-scale analyses that filter out systematic biases, point to a large amount of variation in the composition of biomolecular systems. Such observations challenge our understanding of the function of the systems and their individual components and can potentially facilitate the identification and functional characterization of sub-systems within a system. Mapping the inter-species variation of complex biomolecular systems on a phylogenetic species tree allows one to reconstruct their evolution.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Systems theory and cell biology have enjoyed a long relationship that has received renewed interest in recent years in the context of systems biology. The term 'systems' in systems biology comes from systems theory or dynamic systems theory: systems biology is defined through the application of systems- and signal-oriented approaches for an understanding of inter- and intra-cellular dynamic processes. The aim of the present text is to review the systems and control perspective of dynamic systems. The biologist's conceptual framework for representing the variables of a biochemical reaction network, and for describing their relationships, are pathway maps. A principal goal of systems biology is to turn these static maps into dynamic models, which can provide insight into the temporal evolution of biochemical reaction networks. Towards this end, we review the case for differential equation models as a 'natural' representation of causal entailment in pathways. Block-diagrams, commonly used in the engineering sciences, are introduced and compared to pathway maps. The stimulus-response representation of a molecular system is a necessary condition for an understanding of dynamic interactions among the components that make up a pathway. Using simple examples, we show how biochemical reactions are modelled in the dynamic systems framework and visualized using block-diagrams.

Approaches to modelling gene regulation networks can be categorized, according to increasing detail, as network parts lists, network topology models, network control logic models, or dynamic models. We discuss the current state of the art for each of these approaches. There is a gap between the parts list and topology models on one hand, and control logic and dynamic models on the other hand. The first two classes of models have reached a genome-wide scale, while for the other model classes high throughput technologies are yet to make a major impact.

<ABSTRACT>
Adaptation and behavior are characteristics of life which are fundamentally dynamic. If we want to model the living cell we have to describe it as a dynamic system. Typical dynamic models are based on quantitative differential equations requiring very detailed kinetic knowledge. Alternative modeling techniques for less fine-grained information are better suited to available functional genomics data. As such, constraint-based techniques and qualitative modeling have proven themselves to be valid approaches in cell biology. These approaches offer formal support to check the consistency of molecular networks against phenotypic observations in the light of dynamic systems.

<ABSTRACT>
Systems biology promises to impact significantly on the drug discovery process. One of its ultimate goals is to provide an understanding of the complete set of molecular mechanisms describing an organism. Although this goal is a long way off, many useful insights can already come from currently available information and technology. One of the biggest challenges in drug discovery today is the high attrition rate: many promising candidates prove ineffective or toxic owing to a poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms of biological systems they target. A "systems" approach can help identify pathways related to a disease and can suggest secondary effects of drugs that might cause these problems and thus ultimately improve the drug discovery pipeline.

<ABSTRACT>
An important challenge facing researchers in drug development is how to translate multi-omic measurements into biological insights that will help advance drugs through the clinic. Computational biology strategies are a promising approach for systematically capturing the effect of a given drug on complex molecular networks and on human physiology. This article discusses a two-pronged strategy for inferring biological interactions from large-scale multi-omic measurements and accounting for known biology via mechanistic dynamical simulations of pathways, cells, and organ- and tissue level models. These approaches are already playing a role in driving drug development by providing a rational and systematic computational framework.

<ABSTRACT>
It is now widely accepted that cancer is a genetic disease and that alterations in the DNA sequence underlie the development of every neoplasm. The identification of mutated genes that are causally implicated in oncogenesis ('cancer genes') has been a major goal in medical sciences for the last two decades. The availability of the human genome sequence coupled to the introduction of high throughput sequencing technologies has created an unprecedented opportunity in this field. It is now possible to perform mutational studies of entire cancer genomes thus providing a complete description of mutations underlying human oncogenesis. The recent identification of high frequency mutations in the BRAF and PI3K genes suggests that many more cancer genes remain to be discovered. In this review, we consider how the systematic mutational analysis of gene families in individual neoplasms has led to the identification of a number of cancer genes and how this information is influencing the treatment of cancer.

<ABSTRACT>
The mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase pathway regulates fundamental cellular function such as cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and motility, raising the question how these diverse functions are specified and coordinated. They are encoded through the activation kinetics of the pathway, a multitude of feedback loops, scaffold proteins, subcellular compartmentalisation, and crosstalk with other pathways. These regulatory motifs alone or in combination can generate a multitude of complex behaviour. Systems biology tries to decode this complexity through mathematical modelling and prediction in order to gain a deeper insight into the inner works of signalling networks.

Identification of thioredoxin h-reducible disulphides in proteomes by
differential labelling of cysteines: insight into recognition and
regulation of proteins in barley seeds by thioredoxin h.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1634-44.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Using thiol-specific fluorescence labelling, over 30 putative target proteins of thioredoxin h with diverse structures and functions have been identified in seeds of barley and other plants. To gain insight at the structural level into the specificity of target protein reduction by thioredoxin h, thioredoxin h-reducible disulphide bonds in individual target proteins are identified using a novel strategy based on differential alkylation of cysteine thiol groups by iodoacetamide and 4-vinylpyridine. This method enables the accessible cysteine side chains in the thiol form (carbamidomethylated) to be distinguished from those inaccessible or disulphide bound form (pyridylethylated) according to the mass difference in the peptide mass maps obtained by matrix-assistend laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry. Using this approach, in vitro reduction of disulphides in recombinant barley alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor (BASI) by barley thioredoxin h isoform 1 was analysed. Furthermore, the method was coupled with two-dimensional electrophoresis for convenient thioredoxin h-reducible disulphide identification in barley seed extracts without the need for protein purification or production of recombinant proteins. Mass shifts of 15 peptides, induced by treatment with thioredoxin h and differential alkylation, identified specific reduction of nine disulphides in BASI, four alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitors and a protein of unknown function. Two specific disulphides, located structurally close to the alpha-amylase binding surfaces of BASI and alpha-amylase inhibitor BMAI-1 were demonstrated to be reduced to a particularly high extent. For the first time, specificity of thioredoxin h for particular disulphide bonds is demonstrated, providing a basis to study structural aspects of the recognition mechanism and regulation of target proteins.

Proteomic analysis of urine in patients with intestinal segments
transposed into the urinary tract.

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1729-33.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Intestinal segments are used to replace or reconstruct the urinary bladder when it has become dysfunctional or develops life-threatening disease such as cancer. The quality of life in patients with intestinal segments used to either enlarge or completely replace the native bladder is adversely affected by recurrent urinary tract infections, excessive mucus production and the occasional development of malignancy. At present, there is no reliable method of predicting or noninvasively monitoring these patients for the development of these complications. The characterisation of proteins secreted into urine from the transposed intestinal segments could serve as important indicators of these clinical complications. Urine is an ideal source of material in which to search for biomarkers, since it bathes the affected tissues and can be obtained relatively easily by noninvasive methods. The urinary proteome of patients with intestinal segments transposed into the urinary tract is unknown and we present the first global description of the urinary protein profile in these patients. Sample preparation is a critical step in achieving accurate and reliable data. We describe a method to prepare urinary proteins that was compatible with their subsequent analysis using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This method helped to overcome some of the technical problems encountered in analysing urine from this patient cohort. The method was used to analyse urinary proteins recovered from five healthy controls and ten patients with intestinal segments transposed into the urinary tract. Four low molecular weight proteins were found to be present in nine out of ten for the patient group but for none of the healthy controls. The four proteins were identified as lithostathine-1 alpha precursor, pancreatitis associated protein-1 precursor, liver fatty acid binding protein and testis expressed protein-12. The role of these proteins as potential biomarkers of intestinal cell activity within the reconstructed bladder is discussed.

We aimed to validate an analytical approach based on proteomics on gastric cancer specimens for the identification of new putative diagnostic or prognostic markers. Primary screening was performed on gastrectomy specimens obtained from ten consecutive patients with gastric cancer. Gastric epithelial cells were obtained with an epithelial cell enrichment technique, homogenized and then separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE). The differential protein expression pattern was verified stepwise by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry on samples from 28 and 46 cancer patients, respectively. The putative clinical applicability and prognostic use were tested by an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay on serum samples obtained from 149 cancer patients. One hundred-ninety-one differentially expressed protein spots were found by 2-D PAGE and identified by mass spectrometry, including cathepsin B, which was over-expressed in six (60%) patients. Western blotting confirmed that the active form of cathepsin B is over-expressed, while immunohistochemistry showed strong cytoplasmic staining in cancer tissues of 45 (98%) patients. The serum level of cathepsin B was increased in patients with gastric cancer compared to healthy controls (P = 0.0026) and correlated with T-category and the presence of distant metastases (P < 0.05). Serum levels above 129 pmol x L(-1) were associated with a reduced survival rate (P = 0.0297). Proteome analysis is a valuable tool for the identification of prognostic markers in gastric cancer: Increased cathepsin B serum levels are associated with advanced tumor stages and progressive disease, which enables the classification of some gastric cancer patients into a subgroup that should undergo aggressive therapy.

The identification of foam-forming soluble proteins from wheat (Triticum

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1612-23.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteomic methods have been used to identify foam-forming soluble proteins from dough that may play an important role in stabilising gas bubbles in dough, and hence influence the crumb structure of bread. Proteins from a soluble fraction of dough (dough liquor) or dough liquor foam have been separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and 42 identified using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight and quadrupole-time of flight analyses. Major polypeptide components included beta-amylase, tritin and serpins, with members of the alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor family being particularly abundant. Neither prolamin seed storage proteins nor the surface-active protein puroindoline were found. Commonly used dough ingredients (NaCl, Na L-ascorbate) had only a minor effect on the 2-DE protein profiles of dough liquor, of which one of the more significant was the loss of 9 kDa nonspecific lipid transfer protein. Many proteins were lost in dough liquor foam, particularly tritin, whilst a number of alpha-amylase inhibitors were more dominant, suggesting that these are amongst the most strongly surface-active proteins in dough liquor. Such proteins may play a role determining the ability of the aqueous phase of doughs, as represented by dough liquor, to form an elastic interface lining the bubbles, and hence maintain their integrity during dough proving.

Proteomic analysis of reaper 5' untranslated region-interacting factors
isolated by tobramycin affinity-selection reveals a role for La antigen in
reaper mRNA translation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1645-55.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Translational control is a key step in gene expression regulation during apoptosis. To understand the mechanisms of mRNA translation of a pro-apoptotic gene, reaper (rpr), we adapted the tobramycin-aptamer technique described by Hartmuth et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2002, 99, 16719-16724) for the analysis of proteins interacting with rpr 5' untranslated region (UTR). We assembled ribonucleoprotein complexes in vitro using translation extracts derived from Drosophila embryos and purified the RNA-protein complexes for mas spectrometry analysis. We identified the proteins bound to the 5' UTR of rpr. One of them, the La antigen, was validated by RNA-crosslinking experiments using recombinant protein and by the translation efficiency of reporter mRNAs in Drosophila cells after RNAinterference experiments. Our data provide evidence of the involvement of La antigen in the translation of rpr and set a protocol for purification of tagged-RNA-protein complexes from cytoplasmic extracts.

Differential display of proteins involved in the neural differentiation of
mouse embryonic carcinoma P19 cells by comparative proteomic analysis.

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1656-68.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Mouse embryonic carcinoma P19 cell has been used extensively as a model to study molecular mechanisms of neural differentiation in vitro. After retinoic acid (RA) treatment and aggregation, P19 cells can differentiate into neural cells including neurons and glial cells. In this study, comparative proteomic analysis is utilized to approach the protein profiles associated with the RA-induced neural differentiation of P19 cells. Image analysis of silver stained two-dimensional gels indicated that 28 protein spots had significantly differential expression patterns in both quantity and quality. With mass spectrometry analysis and protein functional exploration, many proteins demonstrated an association with distinct aspects of neural differentiation. These proteins were gag polyprotein, rod cGMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase, 53 kDa BRG1-associated factor A, N-myc downstream regulated 1, Vitamin D receptor associated factor 1, stromal cell derived factor receptor 1, phosphoglycerate mutase, Ran-specific GTPase-activating protein, and retinoic acid (RA)-binding protein. While some cytoskeleton-related proteins such as beta cytoskeletal actin, gamma-actin, actin-related protein 1, tropomyosin 1, and cofilin 1 are related to cell migration and aggregation, other proteins have shown a relationship with distinct aspects of neural differentiation including energy production and utilization, protein synthesis and folding, cell signaling transduction, and self-protection. The differential expression patterns of these 28 proteins indicate their different roles during the neural differentiation of P19 cells. As an initial step toward unveiling the regulations involved in the commitment of pluripotent cells to a neural fate, information from this study may be helpful to uncover the molecular mechanisms of neural differentiation.

The human brain mannose 6-phosphate glycoproteome: a complex mixture
composed of multiple isoforms of many soluble lysosomal proteins.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1520-32.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The lysosome is a membrane delimited cytoplasmic organelle that contains at least 50 hydrolytic enzymes and associated cofactors. The biomedical importance of these enzymes is highlighted by the many lysosomal storage disorders that are associated with mutations in genes encoding lysosomal proteins, and there is also evidence that lysosomal activities may be involved in more widespread human diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize the human brain lysosomal proteome with the goal of establishing a reference map to investigate human diseases of unknown etiology and to gain insights into the cellular function of the lysosome. Proteins containing mannose 6-phosphate (Man6-P), a carbohydrate modification used for targeting resident soluble lysosomal proteins to the lysosome, were affinity-purified using immobilized Man6-P receptor. Fractionation by two-dimensional electrophoresis resolved a complex mixture comprising approximately 800 spots. Constituent proteins in each spot were identified using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (both peptide mass fingerprinting and tandem mass spectrometry) [corrected] on in-gel tryptic digests and N-terminal sequencing. In a complementary analysis, we also analyzed a tryptic digest of the unfractionated mixture by liquid chromatography MS/MS. In total, 61 different proteins were identified. Seven were likely contaminants associated with true Man6-P glycoproteins. Forty-one were known lysosomal proteins of which 11 have not previously been reported to contain Man6-P. An additional nine proteins were either uncharacterized or proteins not previously reported to have lysosomal function. We found that the human brain Man6-P-containing lysosomal proteome is highly complex and contains more proteins with a much greater number of individual isoforms than found in previous studies of Man6-P glycoproteomes.

Post-translational processing of beta-secretase in Alzheimer's disease.

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1533-43.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Beta-amyloid is released into the brains of Alzheimer's patients, where it aggregates and causes damage to neurons. It is cleaved proteolytically from a large transmembrane glycoprotein amyloid precursor protein by a membrane-bound protease, known as beta-secretase identified previously as the acid protease, Asp-2. We have shown previously that beta-secretase is up-regulated by increased intracellular cholesterol, and down-regulated by cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition. Here we show using mass spectrometry that discrete changes in the glycosylation and palmitoylation of beta-secretase occur when cells expressing it are treated with statins.

Stress-induced changes in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe proteome using

novel integrated robotics platform.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1669-85.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Robotic and manual methods have been used to obtain identification of significantly changing proteins regulated when Schizosaccharomyces pombe is exposed to oxidative stress. Differently treated S. pombe cells were lysed, labelled with CyDye and analysed by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis. Gel images analysed off-line, using the DeCyder image analysis software [GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK] allowed selection of significantly regulated proteins. Proteins displaying differential expression were excised robotically for manual digestion and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation - mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Additionally the same set of proteins displaying differential expression were automatically cut and digested using a prototype robotic platform. Automated MALDI-MS, peak label assignment and database searching were utilised to identify as many proteins as possible. The results achieved by the robotic system were compared to manual methods. The identification of all significantly altered proteins provides an annotated peroxide stress-related proteome that can be used as a base resource against which other stress-induced proteomic changes can be compared.

Are splicing mutations the most frequent cause of hereditary disease?

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Disease-causing point mutations are assumed to act predominantly through subsequent individual changes in the amino acid sequence that impair the normal function of proteins. However, point mutations can have a more dramatic effect by altering the splicing pattern of the gene. Here, we describe an approach to estimate the overall importance of splicing mutations. This approach takes into account the complete set of genes known to be involved in disease and suggest that, contrary to current assumptions, many mutations causing disease may actually be affecting the splicing pattern of the genes.

ERK-dependent induction of TNFalpha expression by the environmental
contaminant benzo(a)pyrene in primary human macrophages.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 28;579(9):1904-10.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzo(a)pyrene (BP) are toxic environmental contaminants known to enhance production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta. The present study was designed in order to determine whether TNFalpha, another cytokine acting in inflammation, may also constitute a target for these chemicals. Both TNFalpha mRNA and TNFalpha secretion levels were found to be enhanced in human BP-treated macrophages. Dioxin, a contaminant activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) like PAHs, was also shown to increase TNFalpha expression. BP-mediated TNFalpha induction was however not suppressed by AhR antagonists, making unlikely the involvement of the typical AhR signalling pathway. BP-exposure of macrophages did not enhance NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, but it activated the MAP kinase ERK1/2. In addition, the use of chemical inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) activation fully abrogated induction of TNFalpha production in BP-treated macrophages. These data likely indicate that PAHs enhance TNFalpha expression in human macrophages through an ERK-related mechanism. Such a regulation may contribute to confer pro-inflammatory properties to these widely-distributed environmental contaminants.

Similarities and differences in the transcriptional regulation of the
leptin gene promoter in gastric and adipose cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 28;579(9):1911-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The stomach was reported to synthesize and secrete leptin mainly in the gastric lumen. Gastric leptin release is markedly increased after food intake, by vagal cholinergic stimulation and by cholecystokinin and secretin. Here we show that human gastric MKN-74 cells produce leptin that increases upon challenge with cholecystokinin, insulin, glucocorticoids and all-trans retinoic acid through activation of the leptin gene promoter. In addition, we demonstrate that forskolin and BRL37344 which increased cAMP levels, fail to affect the activity of leptin gene promoter in MKN74 expressing beta(3)-adrenoceptor cells but, induce a 2-fold decrease in this activity in adipose 3T3-L1 cells. These data described for the first time, similarities and more interestingly, differences in the regulation of the leptin gene promoter in gastric cells as compared to adipocytes.

<ABSTRACT>
The potential application of lantibiotics as food-preserving agents and more recently as antibiotics has strongly increased the interest in these antibacterial peptides. Here, we report the elucidation of the primary and three-dimensional structures of the novel lantibiotic epilancin 15X from Staphylococcus epidermidis using high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry. The molecule contains ten post-translationally modified amino acids, three lanthionine ring structures and a hydroxy-propionyl N-terminal moiety. The primary and tertiary structure and the distribution of positive charges are closely similar to the previously identified lantibiotic epilancin K7, most likely indicative of a common mode of action.

Regulation of divalent metal transporter expression in human intestinal

<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 28;579(9):1923-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A number of regulatory factors including dietary iron levels can dramatically alter the expression of the intestinal iron transporter DMT1. Here we show that Caco-2 cells exposed to iron for 4h exhibited a significant decrease in plasma membrane DMT1 protein, though total cellular DMT1 levels were unaltered. Following biotinylation of cell surface proteins, there was a significant increase in intracellular biotin-labelled DMT1 in iron-exposed cells. Furthermore, iron-treatment increased levels of DMT1 co-localised with LAMP1, suggesting that the initial response of intestinal epithelial cells to iron involves internalisation and targeting of DMT1 transporter protein towards a late endosomal/lysosomal compartment.

<ABSTRACT>
Isu are scaffold proteins involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and playing a key role in yeast mitochondria and Escherichia coli. In this work, we have characterized the Arabidopsis thaliana Isu gene family. AtIsu1,2,3 genes encode polypeptides closely related to their bacterial and eukaryotic counterparts. AtIsu expression in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Deltaisu1Deltanfu1 thermosensitive mutant led to the growth restoration of this strain at 37 degrees C. Using Isu-GFP fusions expressed in leaf protoplasts and immunodetection in organelle extracts, we have shown that Arabidopsis Isu proteins are located only into mitochondria, supporting the existence of an Isu-independent Fe-S assembly machinery in plant plastids.

<ABSTRACT>
To better understand the outcome of the interaction between TNF-related apoptosis-inducing factor (TRAIL) and tumor cells, we studied TRAIL-resistant melanoma cells resulting from prolonged exposure to TRAIL and found that they had higher proliferative activity than the parental cells both in vitro and in vivo. This was associated with reduced p53 and p21 expression and increased activation of Erk1/2 and Akt. Accelerated proliferation was not due to TRAIL-mediated signaling but appeared to be the result of selection of previously existing, characteristically distinct cells. Moreover, responses of p53 to stimulation in the TRAIL-resistant cells appeared to be impaired.

due to nucleotide binding.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 28;579(9):1961-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The ability of subunit C of eukaryotic V-ATPases to bind ADP and ATP is demonstrated by photoaffinity labeling and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Quantitation of the photoaffinity and the FCS data indicate that the ATP-analogues bind more weakly to subunit C than the ADP-analogues. Site-directed mutagenesis and N-terminal sequencing of subunit C from Arabidopsis (VHA-C) and yeast (Vma5p) have been used to map the C-terminal region of subunit C as the nucleotide-binding site. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching and decreased susceptibility to tryptic digestion of subunit C after binding of different nucleotides provides evidence for structural changes in this subunit caused by nucleotide-binding.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels, underlying sensory transduction in vertebrate photoreceptors and olfactory sensory neurons, require cyclic nucleotides to open. Here, we present structural models of the tetrameric CNG channel pore from bovine rod in both open and closed states, as obtained by combining homology modeling-based techniques, experimentally derived spatial constraints and structural patterns present in the PDB database. Gating is initiated by an anticlockwise rotation of the N-terminal region of the C-linker, which is then, transmitted through the S6 transmembrane helices to the P-helix, and in turn from this to the pore lumen, which opens up from 2 to 5A thus allowing for ion permeation. The approach, here presented, is expected to provide a general methodology for model ion channels and their gating when structural templates are available and an extensive electrophysiological analysis has been performed.

SKN1, a novel plant defensin-sensitivity gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
is implicated in sphingolipid biosynthesis.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 28;579(9):1973-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The antifungal plant defensin DmAMP1 interacts with the fungal sphingolipid mannosyl diinositolphosphoryl ceramide (M(IP)(2)C) and induces fungal growth inhibition. We have identified SKN1, besides the M(IP)(2)C-biosynthesis gene IPT1, as a novel DmAMP1-sensitivity gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SKN1 was previously shown to be a KRE6 homologue, which is involved in beta-1,6-glucan biosynthesis. We demonstrate that a Deltaskn1 mutant lacks M(IP)(2)C. Interestingly, overexpression of either IPT1 or SKN1 complemented the skn1 mutation, conferred sensitivity to DmAMP1, and resulted in M(IP)(2)C levels comparable to the wild type. These results show that SKN1, together with IPT1, is involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae.

<ABSTRACT>
This study deals with mitochondrial energy efficiency in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria in 15 days cold exposed rats. Cold exposure strongly increases the sensitivity to uncoupling by added palmitate of skeletal muscle but not liver mitochondria, while mitochondrial energy coupling in the absence of fatty acids is only slightly affected by cold in liver and skeletal muscle. In addition, uncoupling protein 3 content does not follow changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial coupling. It is therefore concluded that skeletal muscle could play a direct thermogenic role based on fatty acid-induced mild uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

The activity of a methyltransferase, BchU, which catalyzes methylation at the C-20 position of chlorin ring in the biosynthetic pathway of bacteriochlorophyll c, was investigated in vitro. The bchU gene derived from the photosynthetic green sulfur bacterium, Chlorobium tepidum, was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a His-tagged protein (His(6)-BchU), and the enzyme was purified. In the presence of S-adenosylmethionine, His(6)-BchU methylated zinc bacteriopheophorbide d at the C-20 position to give zinc bacteriopheophorbide c. Metal-free bacteriopheophorbide d could not be methylated by the BchU, indicating that the central metal in the chlorin should be required for the recognition by the BchU.

<ABSTRACT>
We assessed the effect of multiple-mutations within one IgE-binding area on allergenicity of Der f 2. The triple-mutant of Der f 2, P34/95/99A, exhibited the most significant reduction of allergenicity and circular dichroism analysis showed that the global structure of Der f 2 was maintained in P34/95/99A. These results indicate that such a strategy is effective when designing allergen-vaccines, which achieve less allergenicity for a broad population of patients without disrupting the global structure. Structurally, Der f 2 is a member of the MD-2 related lipid-recognition proteins. The sites for the triple-mutation located on the characteristically charged entrance of a cavity and corresponded to the regions critical to ligand-binding in the Niemann-Pick type 2 disease protein and MD-2.

<ABSTRACT>
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by numerous amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plaques surrounded by microglia. Here we report that Abeta induces the proliferation of the mouse microglial cell line Ra2 by increasing the expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). We examined signal cascades for Abeta-induced M-CSF mRNA expression. The induction of M-CSF was blocked by a phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitor (LY294002), a Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor (PP1) and an Akt inhibitor. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that Abeta enhanced NF-kappaB binding activity to the NF-kappaB site of the mouse M-CSF promoter, which was blocked by LY294002. These results indicate that Abeta induces M-CSF mRNA expression via the PI3-kinase/Akt/NF-kappaB pathway.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have characterized the cell surface of zebrafish stratified epithelium using a combined approach of light and atomic force microscopy under conditions which simulate wound healing. Microridges rise on average 100 nm above the surface of living epithelial cells, which correlate to bundles of cytochalasin B-insensitive actin filaments. Time-lapse microscopy revealed the bundles to form a highly dynamic network on the cell surface, in which bundles and junctions were severed and annealed on a time scale of minutes. Atomic force microscopy topographs further indicated that actin bundle junctions identified were of two types: overlaps and integrated end to side T- and Y-junctions. The surface bundle network is found only on the topmost cell layer of the explant, and never on individual locomoting cells. Possible functions of these actin bundles include cell compartmentalization of the cell surface, resistance to mechanical stress, and F-actin storage.

Serine utilization in mouse liver: influence of caloric restriction and
aging.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Mar 28;579(9):2009-13.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The influence of caloric restriction (CR) on the activities of hepatic serine metabolizing enzymes in young (3 months) and old (30 months) mice was studied. Serine dehydratase (SDH) activity increased markedly with age in both diet groups and in old mice was higher in the CR group. No effects of CR were observed in the young. Serine:pyruvate transaminase (SPT) and glycerate kinase activities were unaffected by age and diet. However, glycerate dehydrogenase activity was decreased in old CR mice but not in young CR. The results of this study show that long-term CR influenced serine utilization only in the pathway catalyzed by SDH. This suggests that in mouse liver this pathway is critical for serine utilization in gluconeogenesis, while the SPT pathway plays a minor role. The increase in SDH activity with long-term CR is consistent with sustained increase in gluconeogenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
Endopolyphosphatase (Ppn), responsible for cleavage of long chain inorganic polyphosphate (poly P) of several hundred residues to generate progressively shorter chains, has been identified in mammalian cells and purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Disruption of the encoding gene, PHM5, in S. cerevisiae resulted in a mutant that showed limited growth and failure to survive in a minimal medium. The limited digestion products of the yeast enzyme Ppn1 judged to be P(3) and P(60) have now, with the homogeneous enzyme and improved separation methods, been demonstrated to be P(i) and P(3). Ppn1, a homotetramer of a 35-kDa subunit, is of vacuolar origin and requires protease activation of a 78 kDa (674-aa) precursor polypeptide (prePpn1). The protease-processed Ppn1 has been purified 3800-fold to homogeneity and the protease cleavage sites determined. Both termini of prePpn1 and the post-translational modification of N-glycosylations are essential for the protease-mediated maturation of Ppn1.

A structure-based strategy for discovery of small ligands binding to
functionally unknown proteins: combination of in silico screening and
surface plasmon resonance measurements.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1472-80.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In the postgenomic era, many researchers and organizations have been engaged in structural and functional analyses of proteins. As a part of these efforts, searching for small organic compounds that bind specifically to target proteins is quite important. In this study, we have developed a rational strategy for ligand discovery based on the three-dimensional structures of target proteins, which were elucidated by X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The strategy has three features: (i) rapid selection of candidate compounds by in silico screening, (ii) automated preparation of sample solutions with robotics, and (iii) reliable evaluation of the candidates with surface plasmon resonance. Applying the strategy to a protein, At2g24940 from Arabidopsis thaliana, we discovered four small ligands out of a commercially available library of about 150 000 compounds. Although these compounds had only weak affinities to the target protein, with dissociation constants ranging from 68 to 120 microM, they apparently possess common structural features. They would be leads for the development of specific inhibitors/drugs for At2g24940, and provide important clues toward elucidation of the protein function.

Discovering high mobility group A molecular partners in tumour cells.

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1494-506.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
DNA-based activities rely on an extremely coordinated sequence of events performed by several chromatin-associated proteins which act in concert. High Mobility Group A (HMGA) proteins are non-histone architectural nuclear factors that participate in the regulation of specific genes but they are also believed to have a more general role in chromatin dynamics. The peculiarity of these proteins is their flexibility, both in terms of DNA-binding and in protein-protein interactions. Since these proteins act as core elements in the assembly of multiprotein complexes called enhanceosomes, and have already displayed the ability to interact with several different proteins, we started a proteomic approach for the systematic identification of their molecular partners. By a combination of affinity chromatography, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry we have identified about twenty putative HMGA interactors which could be roughly assigned to three different classes: mRNA processing proteins, chromatin remodelling related factors and structural proteins. Direct HMGA interaction with some of these proteins was confirmed by glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays and the HMGA domain involved was mapped. Blot-overlay experiments reveal that members of the HMGA family share most of their molecular partners but, interestingly, it seems that there are some cell-type specific partners. Taken together, these experimental data indicate that HMGA proteins are highly connected nodes in the chromatin protein network. Since these proteins are strongly implicated with cancer development, the identification of molecules able to perturb the HMGA molecular network could be a possible tool to interfere with their oncogenic activity.

Changes in the proteomic profile during differentiation and maturation of
human monocyte-derived dendritic cells stimulated with granulocyte

<ABSTRACT>
Dendritic cells (DCs) are highly specialized antigen-presenting cells that play an essential role in the immune response. We used the proteomic approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to identify the protein changes that occur during differentiation of DCs from monocytes (Mo) stimulated with granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor/interleukin-4 (GM-CSF/IL-4) and during the maturation of immature DCs stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Sixty-three differentially expressed proteins (+/- two-fold) were unambiguously identified with sequence coverage greater than 20%. They corresponded to only 36 different proteins, because 11 were present as 38 electrophoretic forms. Some proteins such as tropomyosin 4 and heat shock protein 71 presented differentially expressed electrophoretic forms, suggesting that many of the changes in protein expression that accompany differentiation and maturation of DCs occur in post-translationally modified proteins. The largest differences in expression were observed for actin (21-fold in Mo), Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2 (20-fold in Mo), vimentin (eight-fold in immature DCs), lymphocyte-specific protein 1 (12-fold in mature DCs) and thioredoxin (14-fold in mature DCs). Several proteins are directly related to functional and morphological characteristics of DCs, such as cytoskeletal proteins (cytoskeleton rearrangement) and chaperones (antigen processing and presentation), but other proteins have not been assigned specific functions in DCs. Only a few proteins identified here were the same as those reported in proteomic studies of DCs, which used different stimuli to produce the cells (GM-CSF/IL-4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). These data suggest that the DC protein profile depends on the stimuli used for differentiation and especially for maturation.

Proteomics of ischemia/reperfusion injury in rabbit myocardium reveals
alterations to proteins of essential functional systems.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(5):1395-410.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Brief periods of myocardial ischemia prior to timely reperfusion result in prolonged, yet reversible, contractile dysfunction of the myocardium, or "myocardial stunning". It has been hypothesized that the delayed recovery of contractile function in stunned myocardium reflects damage to one or a few key sarcomeric proteins. However, damage to such proteins does not explain observed physiological alterations to myocardial oxygen consumption and ATP requirements observed following myocardial stunning, and therefore the impact of alterations to additional functional groups is unresolved. We utilized two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to identify changes to the protein profiles in whole cell, cytosolic- and myofilament-enriched subcellular fractions from isolated, perfused rabbit hearts following 15 min or 60 min low-flow (1 mL/min) ischemia. Comparative gel analysis revealed 53 protein spot differences (> 1.5-fold difference in visible abundance) in reperfused myocardium. The majority of changes were observed to proteins from four functional groups: (i) the sarcomere and cytoskeleton, notably myosin light chain-2 and troponin C; (ii) redox regulation, in particular several components of the NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex; (iii) energy metabolism, encompassing creatine kinase; and (iv) the stress response. Protein differences appeared to be the result of isoelectric point shifts most probably resulting from chemical modifications, and molecular mass shifts resulting from proteolytic or physical fragmentation. This is consistent with our hypothesis that the time course for the onset of injury associated with myocardial stunning is too brief to be mediated by large changes to gene/protein expression, but rather that more subtle, rapid and potentially transient changes are occurring to the proteome. The physical manifestation of stunned myocardium is therefore the likely result of the summed functional impairment resulting from these multiple changes, rather than a result of damage to a single key protein.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete is the causative agent of Lyme disease, the most common tick-borne disease in the United States. It has been studied extensively to help understand its pathogenicity of infection and how it can persist in different mammalian hosts. We report the proteomic analysis of the archetype B. burgdorferi B31 strain and two other strains (ND40, and JD-1) having different Borrelia pathotypes using strong cation exchange fractionation of proteolytic peptides followed by high-resolution, reversed phase capillary liquid chromatography coupled with ion trap tandem mass spectrometric analysis. Protein identification was facilitated by the availability of the complete B31 genome sequence. A total of 665 Borrelia proteins were identified representing approximately 38% coverage of the theoretical B31 proteome. A significant overlap was observed between the identified proteins in direct comparisons between any two strains (>72%), but distinct differences were observed among identified hypothetical and outer membrane proteins of the three strains. Such a concurrent proteomic overview of three Borrelia strains based upon only the B31 genome sequence is shown to provide significant insights into the presence or absence of specific proteins and a broad overall comparison among strains.

<ABSTRACT>
Cytosolic proteins of Schizosaccharomyces pombe were separated by two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis, to construct the first 2-D reference map. In the pI range 4-7, more than 500 spots were detected by silver staining, and 70 different proteins corresponding to 111 spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry, where necessary. In the pI range 6-9, approximately 330 spots were detected, and 31 proteins corresponding to 38 spots were identified by mass spectrometry. More than 50% of the identified proteins were involved in amino acid, carbohydrate or nucleotide metabolism, and energy production. A second large group of identified proteins comprises heat shock and other stress related proteins and chaperones.

<ABSTRACT>
Human saliva contains a large number of proteins and peptides (salivary proteome) that help maintain homeostasis in the oral cavity. Global analysis of human salivary proteome is important for understanding oral health and disease pathogenesis. In this study, large-scale identification of salivary proteins was demonstrated by using shotgun proteomics and two-dimensinal gel electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (2-DE-MS). For the shotgun approach, whole saliva proteins were prefractionated according to molecular weight. The smallest fraction, presumably containing salivary peptides, was directly separated by capillary liquid chromatography (LC). However, the large protein fractions were digested into peptides for subsequent LC separation. Separated peptides were analyzed by on-line electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using a quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer, and the obtained spectra were automatically processed to search human protein sequence database for protein identification. Additionally, 2-DE was used to map out the proteins in whole saliva. Protein spots 105 in number were excised and in-gel digested; and the resulting peptide fragments were measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry and sequenced by LC-MS/MS for protein identification. In total, we cataloged 309 proteins from human whole saliva by using these two proteomic approaches.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The wheat leaf proteome was mapped and partially characterized to function as a comparative template for future wheat research. In total, 404 proteins were visualized, and 277 of these were selected for analysis based on reproducibility and relative quantity. Using a combination of protein and expressed sequence tag database searching, 142 proteins were putatively identified with an identification success rate of 51%. The identified proteins were grouped according to their functional annotations with the majority (40%) being involved in energy production, primary, or secondary metabolism. Only 8% of the protein identifications lacked ascertainable functional annotation. The 51% ratio of successful identification and the 8% unclear functional annotation rate are major improvements over most previous plant proteomic studies. This clearly indicates the advancement of the plant protein and nucleic acid sequence and annotation data available in the databases, and shows the enhanced feasibility of future wheat leaf proteome research.

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1594-611.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A combined two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-mass spectrometry approach was utilized to identify over 250 proteins of wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Butte 86) starchy endosperm that participate in 13 biochemical processes: ATP interconversion reactions, carbohydrate metabolism, cell division, cytoskeleton, lipid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, protein synthesis/assembly, protein turnover, signal transduction, protein storage, stress/defense, transcription/translation, and transport. Endosperm protein populations were compared at early (10 days post-anthesis, dpa) and late (36 dpa) stages of grain development. Analysis of protein number and spot volume revealed that carbohydrate metabolism, transcription/translation, and protein synthesis/assembly were the principal endosperm functions at 10 dpa followed by nitrogen metabolism, protein turnover, cytoskeleton, cell division, signal transduction, and lipid metabolism. Carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis/assembly were also major functions at 36 dpa, but stress/defense and storage were predominant. The results provide insight into biochemical events taking place during wheat grain development and highlight the value of proteomics in characterizing complex biochemical processes. Further, the proteome maps will facilitate future studies addressing the effects of genetic and environmental factors on the development and quality of wheat grain.

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1705-13.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Chronic allograft rejection remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in lung transplant recipients. Currently, diagnosis is based on lung biopsies or the presence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). To identify a biomarker of rejection we performed a proteome survey of archived bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) acquired from lung transplant recipients between 1993 and 1996 using mass spectrometry (MS). A total of 126 BALF samples from 57 individuals were tested. Initial MS assessment revealed numerous differences in a majority of individuals who experienced BOS, but three unusually intense peaks at m/z = 3373, 3444, and 3488. These were identified as human neutrophil peptides 1-3 (HNP). Quantification by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay showed an elevated HNP level (>0.3 ng/microg protein) in 89% of patients who developed BOS2-3 within 15 months, reaching as high as 6% of the total BALF protein. In control patients, 35% demonstrated a slightly elevated HNP level that declined in all who had subsequent BALF available for testing. HNP levels did not correlate with episodes of acute rejection, cytomegalovirus or fungal infection. In conclusion, elevated HNP levels are associated with the onset of BOS and can predate the clinical onset of disease up to 15 months.

Use of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to differentiate morphospecies

dinoflagellate of harmful algal blooms.

<ABSTRACT>
Contamination of shellfish with paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PST) produced by toxic harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been negatively affecting the shellfish and aquaculture industries worldwide. Therefore, accurate and early identification of toxic phytoplankton species is crucial in HABs surveillance programs that allow fish-farmers to take appropriate preventive measures in shellfish harvesting and other aquaculture activities to overcome the negative impacts of HABs on human health. The identification of toxic dinoflagellates present in the water is currently a time-consuming operation since it requires skillful taxonomists and toxicologists equipped with optical and scanning electron microscopes as well as sophisticated equipment, for example, high-performance liquid chromotography-fluorescence detection. In this paper, a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)-based proteomic approach was applied to discriminate between toxic and nontoxic strains of Alexandrium minutum. Variation in morphological features between toxic and nontoxic strains was minimal and not significant. Also, variation in 2-DE protein patterns within either toxic or nontoxic strains was low, but pronounced differences were detected between toxic and nontoxic strains. The most notable differences between these strains were several abundant proteins with pIs ranging from 4.8 to 5.3 and apparent molecular masses between 17.5 and 21.5 kDa. Groups of proteins, namely NT1, NT2, NT3, and NT4, were consistently found in all nontoxic strains, while T1 and T2 were prominent in the toxic strains. These specific protein spots characteristic for toxic and nontoxic strains remained clearly distinguishable irrespective of the various growth conditions tested. Therefore, they have the potential to serve as "taxonomic markers" to distinguish toxic and nontoxic strains within A. minutum. Initial studies revealed that the expression pattern of T1 was tightly correlated to toxin biosynthesis in the examined alga and may be used to serve as a potential toxin indicator.

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1686-92.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
To identify proteins that could be molecular targets for diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCV-related HCC), we used a proteomic approach to analyze protein expression in samples of human liver. Twenty-six pairs of tumorous and corresponding nontumorous liver samples from patients with HCV-related HCC and six normal liver samples were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. One of the numerous spots that showed stronger intensity in tumorous than in nontumorous samples was identified as alpha enolase, a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. Expression of this protein increased with tumor dedifferentiation and was significantly higher in poorly differentiated HCC than in well-differentiated HCC. This pattern was reproduced by immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Expression of alpha enolase also correlated positively with tumor size and venous invasion. These results suggest that alpha enolase is one of the candidates for biomarkers for tumor progression that deserves further investigation in HCV-related HCC.

<ABSTRACT>
The term orthodisease has recently been introduced to define human disorders in which the pathogenic gene has orthologs in model organism genomes. Here, we describe Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD), a blistering skin disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of ATP2C1 as an orthodisease from a Saccharomyces cerevisiae perspective. ATP2C1 encodes the human secretory pathway Ca(2+)/Mn(2+) ATPase hSPCA1 and is orthologous to the PMR1 gene in S. cerevisiae. hSPCA1 fully complements PMR1 deficiency in yeast and pmr1DeltaS. cerevisiae has proved to be a valuable tool to screen ATP2C1 mutations and address potential pathogenic/pharmacologic mechanisms in HHD. Consequently, this human skin disorder is an ideal example of an orthodisease.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Gaining a detailed understanding of the molecular nature of the redox coupled proton transfer in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is one of the challenges of modern biophysics. The present work addresses this by integrating approaches for simulations of proton transport (PTR) and electron transfer (ET). The resulting method converts the electrostatic energies of different charge configurations and reorganization energies to free-energy profiles for different PTR and ET pathways. This approach provides for the first time a tool to study the actual activation barriers and kinetics of different feasible PTR processes in the cycle of COX. Using this tool, we explore the PTR through the bottleneck water molecules. It is found that a stepwise PTR along this commonly assumed path leads to far too high barriers and is, thus, inconsistent with the observed kinetics. Furthermore, the simulated free-energy profile does not provide a simple gating mechanism. Fortunately, we obtain reasonable kinetics when we consider a PTR that involves a concerted transfer of protons to and from E286. Finally, semi-qualitative considerations of the forward and backward barriers point toward open questions about the actual gating process and offer a feasible pumping mechanism. Although further studies are clearly needed, we believe that our approach offers a general and effective tool for correlating the structure of COX with its function.

<ABSTRACT>
Immunosenescence is the consequence of the continuous attrition caused by chronic antigenic stress. The most important characteristics of immunosenescence (accumulation of memory and effector T cells, reduction of naive T cells, shrinkage of T cell repertoire, reduction of the immunological space) are compatible with this assumption. Immunosenescence can be taken as proof that the beneficial effects of the immune system, devoted to the neutralization of harmful agents early in life, become detrimental late in life, in a period not foreseen by evolution. This perspective could explain the mechanisms of the ageing process as well as the pathogenesis of age-related diseases.

<ABSTRACT>
To assess the etiology of influenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE), a surveillance effort was conducted during 2000-2003 in South-West Japan. All fatal and handicapped patients except one (4/34 patients) exhibited a disorder of mitochondrial beta-oxidation evoked by the inactivated carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) with transiently elevated serum acylcarnitine ratios (C(16:0) + C(18:1))/C(2) > 0.09 during high-grade fever. Analyses of genotypes and allele compositions of CPT II revealed a thermolabile phenotype of compound heterozygotes for [1055T > G/F352C] and [1102G > A/V368I], which shows a higher frequency in IAE patients than healthy volunteers (P < 0.025). The thermolabile phenotype of CPT II variations may be a principal genetic background of IAE in Japanese.

<ABSTRACT>
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a critical role in maintaining energy homeostasis and cardiac function during ischemia in the heart. However, the functional role of AMPK in the heart during exercise is unknown. We examined whether acute exercise increases AMPK activity in mouse hearts and determined the significance of these increases by studying transgenic (TG) mice expressing a cardiac-specific dominant-negative (inactivating) AMPKalpha2 subunit. Exercise increased cardiac AMPKalpha2 activity in the wild type mice but not in TG. We found that inactivation of AMPK did not result in abnormal ATP and glycogen consumption during exercise, cardiac function assessed by heart rhythm telemetry and stress echocardiography, or in maximal exercise capacity.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 11;579(10):2051-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Xestospongin B, a macrocyclic bis-1-oxaquinolizidine alkaloid extracted from the marine sponge Xestospongia exigua, was highly purified and tested for its ability to block inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))-induced Ca(2+) release. In a concentration-dependent manner xestospongin B displaced [(3)H]IP(3) from both rat cerebellar membranes and rat skeletal myotube homogenates with an EC(50) of 44.6 +/- 1.1 microM and 27.4 +/- 1.1 microM, respectively. Xestospongin B, depending on the dose, suppressed bradykinin-induced Ca(2+) signals in neuroblastoma (NG108-15) cells, and also selectively blocked the slow intracellular Ca(2+) signal induced by membrane depolarization with high external K(+) (47 mM) in rat skeletal myotubes. This slow Ca(2+) signal is unrelated to muscle contraction, and involves IP(3) receptors. In highly purified isolated nuclei from rat skeletal myotubes, Xestospongin B reduced, or suppressed IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) oscillations with an EC(50) = 18.9 +/- 1.35 microM. In rat myotubes exposed to a Ca(2+)-free medium, Xestospongin B neither depleted sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores, nor modified thapsigargin action and did not affect capacitative Ca(2+) entry after thapsigargin-induced depletion of Ca(2+) stores. Ca(2+)-ATPase activity measured in skeletal myotube homogenates remained unaffected by Xestospongin B. It is concluded that xestospongin B is an effective cell-permeant, competitive inhibitor of IP(3) receptors in cultured rat myotubes, isolated myonuclei, and neuroblastoma (NG108-15) cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Galectin-9 and galectin-8, members of beta-galactoside-binding animal lectin family, are promising agents for the treatment of immune-related and neoplastic diseases. The proteins consist of two carbohydrate recognition domains joined by a linker peptide, which is highly susceptible to proteolysis. To increase protease resistance, we prepared mutant proteins by serial truncation of the linker peptide. As a result, mutant forms lacking the entire linker peptide were found to be highly stable against proteolysis and retained their biological activities. These mutant proteins might be useful tools for analyzing the biological functions and evaluating the therapeutic potential of galectin-9 and galectin-8.

The low energy emitting states of the Lhca4 subunit of higher plant
photosystem I.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 11;579(10):2071-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The selectively red excited emission spectrum, at room temperature, of the in vitro reconstituted Lhca4, has a pronounced non-equilibrium distribution, leading to enhanced emission from the directly excited low-energy pigments. Two different emitting forms (or states), with maximal emission at 713 and 735nm (F713 and F735) and unusual spectral properties, have been identified. Both high-energy states are populated when selective excitation is into the F735 state and the fluorescence anisotropy spectrum attains the value of 0.3 in the wavelength region where both emission states are present. This indicates that the two states are on the same Lhca4 complex and have transition dipoles with similar orientation.

Control of the Ralstonia solanacearum Type III secretion system (Hrp)
genes by the global virulence regulator PhcA.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 11;579(10):2077-81.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Expression of several virulence factors in the plant pathogen bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum is controlled by a complex regulatory network, at the center of which is PhcA. We provide genetic evidence that PhcA also represses the expression of hrp genes that code for the Type III protein secretion system, a major pathogenicity determinant in this bacterium. The repression of hrp genes in complete medium is relieved in a phcA mutant and two distinct signals, a quorum-sensing signal and complex nitrogen sources, appear to trigger this PhcA-dependent repression. This control of hrp gene expression by PhcA is realized at the level of the HrpG regulatory protein.

The esterase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius as a reporter enzyme and
affinity tag for protein biosynthesis.

<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 11;579(10):2082-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Esterase from thermophilic bacteria Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius can be produced up to 200 microg/ml by coupled in vitro transcription/translation system derived from Escherichia coli. The synthesized thermostable enzyme can be determined by photometrical and fluorescent assays at least up to 10(-8) M concentration or by activity staining in the polyacrylamide gels. Enhanced green fluorescence protein-esterase fusion protein was bound to a matrix with immobilized esterase inhibitor and purified by affinity chromatography. Thus, the esterase is suited as a reporter enzyme to monitor the expression of polypeptides coupled to its N-terminus and simultaneously, as a cleavable tag for polypeptide purification.

A novel hypertonicity-induced cation channel in primary cultures of human

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 11;579(10):2087-91.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In whole-cell recordings on primary cultures of human hepatocytes, we observe the hypertonic activation of a novel type of cation channel with a permeability ratio for Na(+):Li(+):K(+):Cs(+):NMDG(+) of 1:1.2:1.3:1.2:0.6. With a P(Ca)/P(Na) of 0.7 the channel is also clearly permeable to Ca(++). Most likely, the channel is Cl(-) impermeable but its activity critically depends on the extracellular Cl(-) concentration (with the half maximal effect at 88 mmol/l). With a 64% inhibition by amiloride and a complete block by flufenamate and Gd(3+) (at 100 micromol/l each), the channel may represent a molecular link between the amiloride-sensitive and insensitive channels reported so far.

N-terminal glycine-specific protein conjugation catalyzed by microbial
transglutaminase.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 11;579(10):2092-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Here, we report the N-terminal glycine (Gly) residue of a target protein can be a candidate primary amine for site-specific protein conjugation catalyzed by microbial transglutaminase (MTG) from Streptomyces mobaraensis. Gly5-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (EGFP with five additional Gly residues at its N-terminus) was cross-linked with Myc-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (DHFR with the myc epitope sequence at its N-terminus) to yield DHFR-EGFP heterodimers. The reactivities of additional peptidyl linkers were investigated and the results obtained suggested that at least three additional Gly residues at the N-terminus were required to yield the EGFP-DHFR heterodimeric form. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed marked preference of MTG for amino acids adjacent to the N-terminal Gly residue involved in the protein conjugation. In addition, peptide-protein conjugation was demonstrated by MTG-catalyzed N-terminal Gly-specific modification of a target protein with the myc epitope peptide.

BLG-e1 - a novel regulatory element in the distal region of the
beta-lactoglobulin gene promoter.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 11;579(10):2097-104.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
beta-Lactoglobulin (BLG) is a major ruminant milk protein. A regulatory element, termed BLG-e1, was defined in the distal region of the ovine BLG gene promoter. This 299-bp element lacks the established cis-regulatory sequences that affect milk-protein gene expression. Nevertheless, it alters the binding of downstream BLG sequences to histone H4 and the sensitivity of the histone-DNA complexes to trichostatin A treatment. In mammary cells cultured under favorable lactogenic conditions, BLG-e1 acts as a potent, position-independent silencer of BLG/luciferase expression, and similarly affects the promoter activity of the mouse whey acidic protein gene. Intragenic sequences upstream of BLG exon 2 reverse the silencing effect of BLG-e1 in vitro and in transgenic mice.

Acetylcholine from vagal stimulation protects cardiomyocytes against

HIF-1alpha.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 11;579(10):2111-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Electrical stimulation of the vagal efferent nerve improves the survival of myocardial infarcted rats. However, the mechanism for this beneficial effect is unclear. We investigated the effect of acetylcholine (ACh) on hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha using rat cardiomyocytes under normoxia and hypoxia. ACh posttranslationally regulated HIF-1alpha and increased its protein level under normoxia. ACh increased Akt phosphorylation, and wortmannin or atropine blocked this effect. Hypoxia-induced caspase-3 activation and mitochondrial membrane potential collapse were prevented by ACh. Dominant-negative HIF-1alpha inhibited the cell protective effect of ACh. In acute myocardial ischemia, vagal nerve stimulation increased HIF-1alpha expression and reduced the infarct size. These results suggest that ACh and vagal stimulation protect cardiomyocytes through the PI3K/Akt/HIF-1alpha pathway.

<ABSTRACT>
Insoluble deposits of tau and amyloid precursor protein (APP) peptides Abeta characterize Alzheimer's disease. We studied the role of tau in the metabolism of APP in cells stably expressing APP Swedish mutation (CHOsw). Transient expression of tau in CHOsw cells caused morphological changes, bundling of microtubules and perinuclear aggregation of Golgi-derived vesicles. It also reduced the secretion of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) without altering the APP steady state levels. This was accompanied by a reduction in the gamma-secretase and an increase in the insulin degrading enzyme activities. Our results suggest that tau may play an inhibitory role in the amyloidogenic activity of APP.

<ABSTRACT>
Carotenoid composition and its biosynthetic pathway in the cyanobacterium Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421 were investigated. beta-Carotene and (2S,2'S)-oscillol 2,2'-di(alpha-L-fucoside), and echinenone were major and minor carotenoids, respectively. We identified two unique genes for carotenoid biosynthesis using in vivo functional complementation experiments. In Gloeobacter, a bacterial-type phytoene desaturase (CrtI), rather than plant-type desaturases (CrtP and CrtQ), produced lycopene. This is the first demonstration of an oxygenic photosynthetic organism utilizing bacterial-type phytoene desaturase. We also revealed that echinenone synthesis is catalyzed by CrtW rather than CrtO. These findings indicated that Gloeobacter retains ancestral properties of carotenoid biosynthesis.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an important viral structural protein. Based on bioinformatics analysis, 10 antigenic peptides derived from the S protein sequence were selected and synthesized. The antigenicity and immunoreactivity of all the peptides were tested in vivo and in vitro. Four peptides (P6, P8, P9 and P10) which contain B cell epitopes of the S protein were identified, and P8 peptide was confirmed in vivo to have a potential in serological diagnosis. By using a syncytia formation model, we tested the neutralization ability of all 10 peptides and their corresponding antibodies. It is interesting to find that P8 and P9 peptides inhibited syncytia formation, suggesting that the P8 and P9 spanning regions may provide a good target for anti-SARS-CoV drug design. Our data suggest that we have identified peptides derived from the S protein of SARS-CoV, which are useful for SARS treatment and diagnosis.

Psychophysiological stress-regulated gene expression in mice.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 11;579(10):2137-42.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Eight genes showed significant changes in expression in mice under psychophysiological stress provided by cage-restraint and water-immersion. The transcription level of most of these genes was affected in all the tissues analyzed, and some of them were responsive genes in several different stress systems. Peculiarly, the expression level of one gene, cdc2-like kinase 1 (CLK1), was reduced only in the brain, while the balance of partially- and alternatively-spliced CLK1 mRNA species changed in all the tissues including the brain. These results suggest that some stress-response mechanisms, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional events, are coordinated in the whole body in mice under psychophysiological stress.

Evaluation of nuclear transfer and transcription of plasmid DNA condensed

</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 11;579(10):2143-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In the present study, the nuclear delivery of a green fluorescence protein (GFP)-encoding pDNA condensed by protamine was investigated in terms of trans-gene expression after cytoplasmic (E(cyt)) and nuclear (E(nuc)) microinjection. To compare the nuclear transfer process, a novel parameter; the nuclear transfer (NT) score was introduced. The E(cyt) value for protamine/pDNA particles increased in a charge ratio-dependent manner. The calculated NT score showed that this increase results from an enhancement in nuclear transfer efficiency, which was also quantitatively confirmed by a recently developed confocal image-assisted three-dimensionally integrated quantification (CIDIQ) method. Moreover, E(nuc) for protamine/pDNA particles was significantly higher than that for poly-L-lysine/pDNA particles, suggesting that pDNA, when condensed with protamine, is more accessible to intra-nuclear transcription. Collectively, protamine is an excellent DNA condenser, with bi-functional advantages: improvement in nuclear delivery and efficient intra-nuclear transcription.

Sensitization of stefin B-deficient thymocytes towards

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 11;579(10):2149-55.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Stefin B (cystatin B) is an inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine cathepsins and does not inhibit cathepsin D, E (aspartic) or cathepsin G (serine) proteinases. In this study, we have investigated apoptosis triggered by camptothecin, staurosporin (STS), and anti-CD95 monoclonal antibody in the thymocytes from the stefin B-deficient mice and wild-type mice. We have observed increased sensibility to STS-induced apoptosis in the thymocytes of stefin B-deficient mice. Pretreatment of cells with pan-caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone completely inhibited phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase activation, while treatment with inhibitor of calpains- and papain-like cathepsins (2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido-3-methyl-butane ethyl ester did not prevent caspase activation nor phosphatidylserine exposure. We conclude that sensitization to apoptosis induced by STS in thymocytes of stefin B-deficient and wild-type mice is not dependent on cathepsin inhibition by stefin B.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
An mRNA encoding the esterase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius with catalytically essential serine codon (ACG) replaced by an amber (UAG) codon was used to study the suppression in in vitro translation system. Suppression of UAG by tRNA(Ser(CUA)) was monitored by determination of the full-length and active esterase. It was shown that commonly used increase of suppressor tRNA concentration inhibits protein production and therefore limits suppression. In situ deactivation of release factor by specific antibodies leads to efficient suppression already at low suppressor tRNA concentration and allows an in vitro synthesis of fully active enzyme in high yield undistinguishable from wild-type protein.

<ABSTRACT>
Functional expression studies in microorganisms showed that the Arabidopsis thaliana gene At4g04870 represents the cardiolipin synthase (CLS) gene encoding a hydrophobic preprotein of 38 kDa with a cleavable signal peptide for the import into mitochondria. CLS of Arabidopsis over-expressed in Escherichia coli has an alkaline pH optimum, a strict requirement for divalent cations and a distinctly lower K(m) for cytidinediphosphate-diacylglycerol than for phosphatidylglycerol. It displayed a preference for both its substrates esterified with unsaturated acyl groups. Solubilization and purification experiments revealed that the protein requires a defined phospholipid environment, particularly the presence of cardiolipin, to acquire its catalytically active conformation.

<ABSTRACT>
The Na(v)1.6 voltage-gated sodium channel has been implicated in the generation of resurgent currents in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Our data show that resurgent sodium currents are produced by some large diameter dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from wild-type mice, but not from Na(v)1.6-null mice; small DRG neurons do not produce resurgent currents. Many, but not all, DRG neurons transfected with Na(v)1.6 produce resurgent currents. These results demonstrate for the first time the intrinsic ability of Na(v)1.6 to produce a resurgent current, and also show that cell background is critical in permitting the generation of these currents.

<ABSTRACT>
Bursicon is a neurohumoral agent responsible for tanning and hardening of the cuticle and expansion of the wings during the final phase of insect metamorphosis. Although the hormonal activity was described more than 40 years ago, the molecular nature of bursicon has remained elusive. We identify here Drosophila bioactive bursicon as a heterodimer made of two cystine knot polypeptides. This conclusion was reached in part from the unexpected observation that in the genome of the honey bee, the orthologs of the two Drosophila proteins are predicted to be fused in a single open reading frame. The heterodimeric Drosophila protein displays bursicon bioactivity in freshly enclosed neck-ligated flies and is the natural agonist of the orphan G protein-coupled receptor DLGR2.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The mechanisms underlying regional amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) deposition in brain remain unclear. Here we show that assembly of hereditary variant Dutch- and Italian-type Abetas, and Flemish-type Abeta was accelerated by GM3 ganglioside, and GD3 ganglioside, respectively. Notably, cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells, which compose the cerebral vessel wall at which the Dutch- and Italian-type Abetas deposit, exclusively express GM3 whereas GD3 is upregulated in the co-culture of endothelial cells and astrocytes, which forms the cerebrovascular basement membrane, the site of Flemish-type Abeta deposition. Our results suggest that regional Abeta deposition is induced by the local gangliosides in the brain.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Oligopeptidase B (OpdB) from Trypanosoma brucei is a candidate therapeutic target in African trypanosomiasis. OpdB is an atypical serine peptidase, since activity is inhibited by thiol-blocking reagents and enhanced by reducing agents. We have identified C256 as the reactive cysteine residue that mediates OpdB inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetic acid. Modeling studies suggest that C256 adducts occlude the P(1) substrate-binding site, preventing substrate binding. We further demonstrate that C559 and C597 are responsible for the thiol-enhancement of OpdB activity. These studies may facilitate the development of specific OpdB inhibitors with therapeutic potential, by exploiting these unique properties of this enzyme.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 11;579(10):2203-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a very recently discovered enzyme which specifically removes methyl groups from Lys4 of histone 3. We have addressed the functional properties of the protein demonstrating that histone demethylation involves the flavin-catalysed oxidation of the methylated lysine. The nature of the substrate that acts as the electron acceptor required to complete the catalytic cycle was investigated. LSD1 converts oxygen to hydrogen peroxide although this reactivity is not as pronounced as that of other flavin-dependent oxidases. Our findings raise the possibility that in vivo LSD1 might not necessarily function as an oxidase, but it might use alternative electron acceptors.

<ABSTRACT>
The properties of the heme, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and FeS domains of P450 RhF, from Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784, expressed separately and in combination are analysed. The nucleotide preference, imidazole binding and reduction potentials of the heme and FMN domains are unaltered by their separation. The intact enzyme is monomeric and the flavin is confirmed to be FMN. The two one-electron reduction potentials of the FMN are -240 and -270 mV. The spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties of the FeS domain, masked in the intact enzyme, are revealed for the first time, confirming it as a 2Fe-2S ferredoxin with a reduction potential of -214 mV.

Uteroglobin-related protein 2 (UGRP2) is thought to play a role in inflammation and/or epithelial cell differentiation in the lung. Induction of Ugrp2 mRNA expression by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha was examined using mouse transformed lung Clara cell-derived mtCC cells. The EGF-induced increase of Ugrp2 occurred at the transcriptional level that required the EGF receptor and the activation of the ERK-MAPK and phosphoinositide-3 kinase pathways.

<ABSTRACT>
mRNA localisation, as a mechanism for directing localised protein synthesis, plays a vital role in the functioning of certain cells, such as neurons and oocytes. Potentially this mechanism may also occur in polarised intestinal epithelial cells. Here we show that Staufen1(55), a protein involved in mRNA localisation and transport, is asymmetrically distributed in differentiated Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells and partly co-localised with calnexin, a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum. The localisation to the apical region of the cell indicates that Staufen may be involved in localisation of transcripts to this domain.

Complementation of two mutant p53: implications for loss of heterozygosity

<ABSTRACT>
Remarkably, a cancer cell rarely possesses two mutant p53 proteins. Instead, mutation of one allele is usually associated with loss of the second p53 allele. Why do not two mutant p53 co-exist? We hypothesize that two different p53 may complement each other, when expressed at equal levels. By titrating trans-deficient and DNA-binding-deficient p53 in cells with mutant p53 and by co-transfecting distinct mutant p53 in p53-null cells, we demonstrated activation of p53-dependent transcription. We suggest that, due to complementation of two mutant p53, cancer cells need to delete the second p53 allele rather than mutate it.

<ABSTRACT>
Semaphorins constitute a large family of signaling proteins that contribute to axonal guidance. Here we demonstrate that the transmembrane semaphorin Sema4C is up-regulated both in the early stage of differentiation of C2C12 mouse skeletal myoblasts into myotubes and during injury-induced muscle regeneration in vivo. Depletion of Sema4C in C2C12 cells resulted in marked attenuation of myotube formation. A fusion protein containing the extracellular Sema domain and a peptide corresponding to the intracellular COOH-terminal region of Sema4C each inhibited the differentiation of C2C12 cells. These findings indicate that Sema4C-mediated interaction among myoblasts plays an important role in terminal myogenic differentiation.

<ABSTRACT>
Pi binding by the F(1)-ATPase of beef heart mitochondria and of the Escherichia coli plasma membrane (E. coli F(1)) was examined by two methods: the centrifuge column procedure [Penefsky, H.S. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 2891-2899] and the Paulus pressure dialysis cell [Paulus, H. (1969) Anal. Biochem. 32, 91-100]. The latter is an equilibrium dialysis-type procedure. Pi binding by beef heart F(1) could be determined by either procedure. However, direct binding of Pi to E. coli F(1) could be determined adequately only in the Paulus cell which indicated more than two binding sites per mol of enzyme with a K(d) in the range of 0.1 mM. It is concluded that previous failure to observe Pi binding to E. coli F(1) with the centrifuge column procedure is due to a rapid rate of dissociation of Pi from the E. coli enzyme which results in loss of Pi during transit of the enzyme-Pi complex through the column.

<ABSTRACT>
In the present study we show results of a large-scale proteome analysis of the recently sequenced plant Arabidopsis thaliana. On the basis of a previously published sequential protein extraction protocol, we prepared protein extracts from eight different A. thaliana tissues (primary leaf, leaf, stem, silique, seedling, seed, root, and inflorescence) and analysed these by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. A total of 6000 protein spots, from three of these tissues, namely primary leaf, silique and seedling, were excised and the contained proteins were analysed by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry peptide mass fingerprinting. This resulted in the identification of the proteins contained in 2943 spots, which were found to be products of 663 different genes. In this report we present and discuss the methodological and biological results of our plant proteome analysis.

Identification of shed proteins from Chinese hamster ovary cells:
application of statistical confidence using human and mouse protein
databases.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 May;5(7):1815-26.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The shedding process releases ligands, receptors, and other proteins from the surface of the cell and is a mechanism whereby cells communicate. Even though altered regulation of this process has been implicated in several diseases, global approaches to evaluate shed proteins have not been developed. A goal of this study was to identify global changes in shed proteins in media taken from cells exposed to low-doses of radiation to develop a fundamental understanding of the bystander response. Chinese hamster ovary cells were chosen because they have been widely used for radiation studies and are reported to respond to radiation by releasing factors into the media that cause genomic instability and cytotoxicity in unexposed cells, i.e., a bystander effect. Media samples taken for irradiated cells were evaluated using a combination of tandem- and Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR)-mass spectrometry (MS) analyses. Since the hamster genome has not been sequenced, MS data was searched against the mouse and human protein databases. Nearly 150 proteins identified by tandem mass spectrometry were confirmed by FT-ICR. When both types of MS data were evaluated, using a new confidence scoring tool based on discriminant analyses, about 500 proteins were identified. Approximately 20% of these identifications were either integral membrane proteins or membrane associated proteins, suggesting that they were derived from the cell surface and, hence were likely shed. However, estimates of quantitative changes, based on two independent MS approaches, did not identify any protein abundance changes attributable to the bystander effect. Results from this study demonstrate the feasibility of global evaluation of shed proteins using MS in conjunction with cross-species protein databases and that significant improvement in peptide/protein identifications is provided by the confidence scoring tool.

Proteome investigation of the global regulatory role of sigma 54 in
response to gentisate induction in Pseudomonas alcaligenes NCIMB 9867.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 May;5(7):1868-76.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Pseudomonas alcaligenes NCIMB 9867 (strain P25X) utilizes the gentisate pathway for the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons. The gene encoding the alternative sigma (sigma) factor sigma(54), rpoN, was cloned from strain P25X and a rpoN knock-out strain, designated G54, was constructed by insertional inactivation with a kanamycin resistance gene cassette. The role of sigma(54) in the physiological response of P. alcaligenes P25X to gentisate induction was assessed by comparing the global protein expression profiles of the wild-type P25X with the rpoN mutant strain G54. Analysis of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels showed that 39 out of 355 prominent protein spots exhibited differential expression as a result of the insertional inactivation of rpoN. Identification of the protein spots by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/time of flight revealed a wide diversity of proteins that are affected by the sigma(54) mutation, the largest group being proteins that are involved in carbon metabolism. The strictly inducible gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, one of two isofunctional copies of the key enzyme in the gentisate pathway, and enzymes of the TCA cycle, pyruvate metabolism and gluconeogenesis were part of this group. Other proteins that are part of the sigma(54) regulon include enzymes implicated in nitrogen metabolism, transport proteins, stress-response proteins and proteins involved in cell motility. The results of this study showed that sigma(54) plays a global regulatory role in the expression of a wide variety of genes in P. alcaligenes, including the wild-type response to the presence of the aromatic inducer, gentisate.

Determination of partial amino acid composition from tandem mass spectra
for use in peptide identification strategies.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 May;5(7):1787-96.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We demonstrate a new approach to the determination of amino acid composition from tandem mass spectrometrically fragmented peptides using both experimental and simulated data. The approach has been developed to be used as a search-space filter in a protein identification pipeline with the aim of increased performance above that which could be attained by using immonium ion information. Three automated methods have been developed and tested: one based upon a simple peak traversal, in which all intense ion peaks are treated as being either a b- or y-ion using a wide mass tolerance; a second which uses a much narrower tolerance and does not perform transformations of ion peaks to the complementary type; and the unique fragments method which allows for b- or y-ion type to be inferred and corroborated using a scan of the other ions present in each peptide spectrum. The combination of these methods is shown to provide a high-accuracy set of amino acid predictions using both experimental and simulated data sets. These high quality predictions, with an accuracy of over 85%, may be used to identify peptide fragments that are hard to identify using other methods. The data simulation algorithm is also shown post priori to be a good model of noiseless tandem mass spectrometric peptide data.

A strategy for high-resolution protein identification in surface-enhanced
laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry: calgranulin A and
chaperonin 10 as protein markers for endometrial carcinoma.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 May;5(7):1953-66.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (SELDI-MS) has conventionally been practiced on linear time of flight (TOF) which has low mass accuracy and resolution. Here we demonstrate in an examination of both malignant and nonmalignant endometrial tissue homogenates that high mass accuracy and resolution in the MS stage are crucial. Using a commercially available quadrupole/TOF (QqTOF), we were able to resolve two potential cancer markers, subsequently identified off-line as chaperonin 10 and calgranulin A, that differ by 8 Da in mass. Two off-line protein identification protocols were developed: the first was based on size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), protein extraction, trypsin digestion, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-tandem MS (MALDI-MS/MS); the second on SEC and shotgun nano-liquid chromatography (nanoLC)-MS/MS. Analyses on a cohort of 44 endometrial homogenates showed 22 out of 23 nonmalignant samples had nondetectable to very low abundance of chaperonin 10 and calgranulin A; 17 of the 21 malignant samples had detectable to abundant levels of both proteins. Immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray of 32 samples showed that approximately half of malignant endometrial tissues exhibited positive staining for calgranulin A in the malignant epithelium, while 9 out of 10 benign tissues exhibited negative epithelial staining. In addition, macrophages/granulocytes in malignant as well as nonmalignant tissues showed positive staining. No immunostaining occurred in stroma or myometrium. Calgranulin A, in combination with chaperonin 10 and other proteins, may eventually constitute a panel of markers to permit diagnosis and screening of endometrial cancer.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Our current approach focused on the identification of potential early protein biomarker signatures which are indicative of the carcinogenic processes in rats exposed to 20 mg/kg of the liver carcinogen N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM). Treated liver was investigated at different timepoints. Therefore, proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as a first step prior to identification of differentially expressed proteins by mass spectrometry. Proteomic analysis of liver samples after one day of exposure revealed significant upregulation of proteins involved in response to cellular stress induced by NNM (superoxide dismutase, heat shock protein 60, peroxiredoxin). Eighteen weeks after withdrawal of NNM, we were able to identify cancer-related proteins in rat liver bearing malignant, transformed cells (caspase-8 precursor, vimentin, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor). Some of these proteins were already deregulated after three weeks of exposure indicating their potential usefulness as early predictive biomarkers for liver carcinogenicity (annexin A5, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase). As regulatory toxicology approaches usually include the investigation of carcinogenicity in two-years studies in rodents, especially the detection of early protein biomarker signatures which precede the appearance of neoplasia, demonstrates the high potential of proteomics approaches to substantially reduce the time and costs of carcinogenicity testing.

Optimised two-dimensional electrophoresis procedures for the protein
characterisation of structural tissues.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The protein analysis of structural tissues is typically highly problematic. Amniotic membrane displays unique wound healing and anti-scarring properties; however, little is known concerning its active protein content. The structural nature of amniotic membrane necessitated development and extensive optimisation of the entire two-dimensional (2-D) workflow. Proteins were extracted using powerful solubilisation buffers and analysis carried out using 2-D electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry (MS) identification. Preservation and processing resulted in prefractionation of soluble from structural and membrane-associated proteins. Enhanced protein solubility was achieved by cysteine blocking using both N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) alkylation and bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulphide (HED); an alternative procedure for the effective application of HED is demonstrated. The benefits of precipitation and cup-loading versus in-gel rehydration were also assessed, with procedures for the employment of HED with the latter described. Following optimisation, a representative sample 21 proteins were identified from amniotic membrane using MS verify procedures were MS-compatible. Our results demonstrate that techniques for the reproducible separation of proteins from a proteinaceous structural tissue have been optimised. Briefly, proteins are extracted using a thiourea/urea extraction buffer containing carrier ampholytes, dithiothreitol (DTT), and 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS). After DMA alkylation, proteins were precipitated (using the 2-D clean-up kit from Amersham Biosciences) and resolubilised in extraction buffer containing a lower concentration of DTT. Samples were either cup-loaded onto rehydrated HED-containing strips or rebuffered into HED-containing buffer followed by in-gel rehydration.

Proteomics. 2005 May;5(7):1827-37.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A number of experiments, conducted under microgravity conditions, i.e. in space shuttle biolaboratories or in ground based systems simulating the conditions occurring in microgravity, show that in hypogravity, in vitro human lymphocyte activation is severely impaired. However, very early stimulation steps of T lymphocytes are not compromised, since CD69 receptor, the earliest membrane activation marker, is expressed by T cells at a level comparable to that observed on 1 g activated lymphocytes. Since CD69 engagement, together with submitogenic doses of phorbol esters, transduces an activation signal to T lymphocytes, we undertook a comparative study on the stimulation mediated through this receptor on human CD3+ cells cultured under conditions similar to those which occur during exposure to microgravity, i.e. in clinorotation, or at 1 g. During the early hours of activation, increased levels of intracellular calcium and increased mitochondrial membrane potential were detectable in clinorotating as well as in 1 g cells. However, after 48 hours clinorotation, interleukin 2 production by T lymphocytes was significantly reduced and cell proliferation was greatly decreased. By means of a differential proteomics approach on T cells activated in clinorotation or at 1 g for 48 hours, we were able to detect statistically significant quantitative protein alterations. Seven proteins with modified expression values were identified; they are involved in nucleic acids processing, proteasome regulation and cytoskeleton structure.

Subcellular proteomic analysis of host-pathogen interactions using human
monocytes exposed to Yersinia pestis and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.

Proteomics. 2005 May;5(7):1877-88.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Yersinia pestis, the etiological agent of plague, is of concern to human health both from an infectious disease and a biodefense perspective. While Y. pestis and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis share more than 90% DNA homology, they have significantly different clinical manifestations. Plague is often fatal if untreated, yet Y. pseudotuberculosis causes severe intestinal distress but is rarely fatal. A better understanding of host response to these closely related pathogens may help explain the different mechanisms of virulence and pathogenesis that result in such different clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to characterize host protein expression changes in human monocyte U937 cells after exposure to Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis. In order to gain global proteomic coverage of host response, proteins from cytoplasmic, nuclear and membrane fractions of host cells were studied by two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis and relative protein expression differences were quantitated. Differentially expressed proteins, with at least 1.5-fold expression changes and p values of 0.01 or less, were identified by mass spectrometry including matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-MS or liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. With these criteria, differential expression was detected in 16 human proteins after Y. pestis exposure and 13 human proteins after Y. pseudotuberculosis exposure, of which only two of the differentially expressed proteins identified were shared between the two exposures. Proteins identified in this study are reported to be involved in a wide spectrum of cellular functions and host defense mechanisms including apoptosis, cytoskeletal rearrangement, protein synthesis and degradation, DNA replication and transcription, metabolism, protein folding, and cell signaling. Notably, the differential expression patterns observed can distinguish the two pathogen exposures from each other and from unexposed host cells. The functions of the differentially expressed proteins identified provide insight on the different virulence and pathogenic mechanisms of Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis.

Proteomics of breast cancer: enhanced expression of cytokeratin19 in human
epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 positive breast tumors.

Proteomics. 2005 May;5(7):1797-805.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The human epidermal growth factor receptor, type 2 (HER-2/neu or c-erbB-2) is a 185 kDa transmembrane protein that is phosphorylated upon ligand binding and dimerization with members of the HER/c-erbB family and regulates cell growth and differentiation. Its overexpression is strongly associated with advanced disease, metastasis and poor clinical outcome. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the poor prognosis of breast tumors with HER-2/neu-positive status, parallel proteomic analyses were performed on estrogen receptor-negative and node-positive breast tumors with or without overexpression of the HER-2/neu oncogene, using laser capture microdissection and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The differentially expressed proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Cytokeratin 19 (CK19), one of the identified proteins, was highly expressed in the HER-2/neu-positive breast tumors when compared with HER-2/neu-negative breast tumors. The enhanced overexpression of CK19 in HER-2/neu-positive tumors was further analyzed using semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and reverse-phase protein arrays. Immunohistochemical staining of sections from a breast tumor tissue microarray of 97 tumors showed moderate to strong staining against anti-CK19 antibody in 20 (5 with moderate and 15 with strong staining) of the 26 HER-2/neu-positive tumors (76.9%) and in 22 (12 with moderate and 10 with strong staining) of 52 HER-2/neu-negative tumors (48%) (p = 0.002). Our results indicate that CK19, an intermediate fragment of the cytoskeleton, and other proteins showing differential expression, are likely to be intricately involved in intra- and intercellular molecular events driving the more aggressive tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis associated with HER-2/neu-positive tumors.

<ABSTRACT>
Non-DNA microarrays, such as protein, peptide and small molecule microarrays, can potentially revolutionize the high-throughput screening tools currently used in basic and pharmaceutical research. However, fundamental obstacles remain that limit their rapid and widespread implementation as an alternative bioanalytical approach. These include the prerequisite for numerous proteins in active and purified form, ineffectual immobilization strategies and inadequate means for quality control of the considerable numbers of multiple reagents. This study describes a simple yet efficient strategy for the production of non-DNA microarrays, based on the tenacious affinity of a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) for its three-dimensional substrate, i.e., cellulose. Various microarray formats are described, e.g., conventional and single-chain antibody microarrays and peptide microarrays for serodiagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus patients. CBM-based microarray technology overcomes many of the previous obstacles that have hindered fabrication of non-DNA microarrays and provides a technically simple but effective alternative to conventional microarray technology.

Proteomics. 2005 May;5(7):1940-52.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Plasma microparticles (MPs) are spherical cell membrane fragments derived from either apoptotic or activated cells. Characterized by a rich phospholipid moiety and many protein constituents, MPs normally circulate in the blood and contribute to numerous physiological processes. In disease states, MPs derived from the injured organ likely contain valuable markers for determining the site, type, and extent of disease pathology. However, the basic protein characteristics of plasma MPs have yet to be described. In this study, MPs from a pooled plasma sample derived from 16 healthy donors, all of group A blood type, were prepared by ultracentrifugation. Flow cytometry confirmed that a majority of these MPs are smaller than 1 microm. Factor Xa generation assay revealed the presence of tissue factor activity in these MPs, confirming MPs' role in initiating blood coagulation. The MP proteome was analyzed by two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis performed in triplicate, and compared with a 2-D gel of pooled whole plasma and blood platelets. Overall, plasma MPs displayed distinct protein features and a greater number of protein spots (1021-1055) than that detected in whole plasma (331-370). Protein spots expressed in high abundance in the MP proteome were then excised and submitted for protein identity determination. This process provided protein identification for 169 protein spots and reported their relative protein quantities within the MP proteome. These 169 protein spots represented 83 different proteins and their respective isoforms. Thirty of these proteins have never before been reported in previous proteome analyses of human plasma. These results provide unprecedented information on the MP proteome and create a basis for future studies to understand MP biology and pathophysiology.

Proteomic changes associated with inactivation of the Candida glabrata
ACE2 virulence-moderating gene.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 May;5(7):1838-48.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Inactivation of the gene encoding the transcriptional activator Ace2 in the fungal pathogen Candida glabrata results in an almost 200-fold increase in virulence characterised by acute mortality and a massive over-stimulation of the pro-inflammatory arm of the innate immune system. In this study we have adopted a proteomics approach to identify cellular functions regulated by C. glabrata Ace2 that might contribute to this increase in virulence. A two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis map of the C. glabrata proteome was constructed. We identified a total of 123 proteins, 61 of which displayed reproducible and statistically significant alterations in their levels following inactivation of ACE2. Of these, the levels of 32 proteins were elevated, and 29 were reduced in ace2 cells. These data show that Ace2 influences metabolism, protein synthesis, folding and targeting, and aspects of cell growth and polarisation. Some of these functions are likely to contribute to the effects of Ace2 upon the virulence of C. glabrata.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Protein complexes are major components of cellular organization. Based on large-scale protein complex data, we present the first statistical procedure to find insightful substructures in protein complexes: we identify protein subcomplexes (SCs), i.e., multiprotein assemblies residing in different protein complexes. Four protein complex datasets with different origins and variable reliability are separately analyzed. Our method identifies well-characterized protein assemblies with known functions, thereby confirming the utility of the procedure. In addition, we also identify hitherto unknown functional entities consisting of either functionally unknown proteins or proteins with different functional annotation. We show that SCs represent more reliable protein assemblies than the original complexes. Finally, we demonstrate unique properties of subcomplex proteins that underline the distinct roles of SCs: (i) SCs are functionally and spatially more homogeneous than complete protein complexes (this fact is utilized to predict functional roles and subcellular localizations for so far unannotated proteins); (ii) the abundance of subcomplex proteins is less variable than the abundance of other proteins; (iii) SCs are enriched with essential and synthetic lethal proteins; and (iv) mutations in SC-proteins have higher fitness effects than mutations in other proteins.

Proteomics. 2005 May;5(7):1774-86.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
This paper reviews methods for the analysis of N-linked glycans by mass spectrometry with emphasis on studies conducted at the Oxford Glycobiology Institute. Topics covered are the release of glycans from sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, their purification for analysis by mass spectrometry, methods based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization for producing fragment ions, and details of their fragmentation. MALDI mass spectrometry provided a rapid method for profiling neutral N-linked glycans as their [M + Na](+) ions which could be fragmented by collision-induced decomposition to give spectra containing both glycosidic and cross-ring fragments. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was more versatile in that it was relatively easy to change the type of ion that was formed and, furthermore, unlike MALDI, electrospray did not cause extensive loss of sialic acids from sialylated glycans. Negative ions formed by addition of anions such as chloride and, particularly, nitrate, to the electrospray solvent were stable and enabled singly charged ions to be obtained from larger glycans than was possible in positive ion mode. Fragmentation of negative ions followed specific pathways that defined structural details of the glycans that were difficult to obtain by classical methods such as exoglycosidase digestion.

<ABSTRACT>
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an allergic disease that has recently shown a dramatic increase of incidence in developed countries. Eosinophilia, the accumulation of eosinophils, occurs in AD patients through an anti-apoptotic mechanism. To understand the target proteins involved in the anti-apoptotic signaling of eosinophilia, we used a proteomic approach to analyze eosinophil proteins from AD patients with eosinophilia and healthy donors. Protein spots in two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) gels were identified with peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and database searching. More spots were observed in the 2-DE proteome map from AD patient samples (1310 +/- 58 spots) than in those from healthy donors (1121 +/- 40 spots). We identified 51 proteins affected by eosinophilia: 19 related to signaling, 8 involved in regulation of metabolism, 4 related to apoptosis, and 3 involved in inflammation. The other identified proteins were associated with transcription, RNA processing, translation, the cytoskeleton, and unknown functions. Among the identified proteins, we observed prominent increases in the expressions of cyclinA2, voltage-dependent anion channel protein 2, and 38 kDa FK506 binding protein 8 in eosinophils from AD patients in comparison to healthy donors. PMF and immunoblotting of a single spot that was expressed in eosinophils from healthy individuals but not in AD patients identified the protein as phosphorylated growth receptor binding 7 (Grb7) adaptor protein. Increased phosphorylation of Grb7 and its upstream signaling protein, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), was detected in low viability eosinophils such as those from healthy donors or in cultured eosinophils (AML14.3D10 cells) treated with dexamethasone. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Grb7 and the expressions of cyclinA2, voltage-dependent anion channel protein 2, and 38 kDa FK506 binding protein 8 may be related with the anti-apoptosis mechanism of eosinophilia.

<ABSTRACT>
The formation of protein complexes is a hallmark of cellular signal transduction. Here, we show that peptide microarrays provide a robust and quantitative means to detect signalling-dependent changes of molecular interactions. Recruitment of a protein into a complex upon stimulation of a cell leads to the masking of an otherwise exposed binding site. In cell lysates this masking can be detected by reduced binding to a microarray carrying a peptide that corresponds to the binding motif of the respective interaction domain. The method is exemplified for the lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase 70 kDa zeta-associated protein binding to a bis-phosphotyrosine-motif of the activated T-cell receptor via its tandem SH2 domain. Compared to established techniques, the method provides a significant shortcut to the detection of molecular interactions.

<ABSTRACT>
A murine monoclonal antibody (mAb), CLD3 (IgG(1),kappa), was generated against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Both immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical assays indicated the reactivity of CLD3 mAb localized at the nucleus and/or cytoplasm of tumorigenic HCC cell lines as well as in liver cancer tissues. By immunoprecipitation and using the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry approach, the antigenic specificity of CLD3 was determined to be heterodimeric Ku70 and Ku80 autoantigen, which was confirmed by Western blotting.

<ABSTRACT>
The intensive use of herbicides may give rise to a number of toxicological problems in non-target organisms and has led to the emergence of resistant weeds. To gain insights into the mechanisms of adaptation to the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), we have identified variations in protein expression level in the eukaryotic experimental model Saccharomyces cerevisiae exposed to herbicide aggression, based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We show results suggesting that during the adaptation period preceding the resumption of inhibited exponential growth under herbicide stress, the antioxidant enzyme Ahp1p and the heat shock proteins Hsp12p and Ssb2p (or Ssb1p) are present in higher amounts. The increased level of other enzymes involved in protein (Cdc48p) and mRNA (Dcp1p) degradation, in carbohydrate metabolism (Eno1p, Eno2p and Glk1p) and in vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) function (Vma1p and Vma2p, two subunits of the peripheral catalytic sector) was also registered. V-ATPase is involved in the homeostasis of intracellular pH and in the compartmentalization of amino acids and other metabolites in the vacuole. The increased expression of amino acid biosynthetic enzymes (Arg1p, Aro3p, Aro8p, Gdh1p, His4p, Ilv3p and Met6p), also suggested by comparative analysis of the proteome, was correlated with the reduction of amino acid concentration registered in both the vacuole and the cytosol of 2,4-D-stressed cells, possibly due to the disturbance of vacuolar and plasma membrane functions by the lipophilic acid herbicide.

Towards a proteomic definition of CoArtem action in Plasmodium falciparum
malaria.

Proteomics. 2005 May;5(7):1849-58.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have adopted a proteomic strategy to investigate the actions of the two active components of the new antimalarial CoArtem, artemether and lumefantrine, following pharmacologically relevant drug exposure in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Both drugs induced profound alterations in the parasite's proteome. Moreover, the pattern of proteome alteration was specific for the drug used. The two drugs induced opposing effects on key glycolytic enzymes while exerting similar influence of the expression of stress response proteins. These initial results demonstrate the power of this approach in the study of pleiomorphic mechanisms of drug action.

A rare and often unrecognized cerebromeningitis and hemodynamic disorder:
a major cause of sudden death in somatic cell cloned piglets.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 May;5(7):1928-39.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In this study, we generated 40 somatic cell cloned (scNT) piglets. Of these, five piglets were stillborn, 22 scNT piglets died suddenly within the first week of life, and 1 piglet died after 40 days. Twelve scNT piglets are still healthy. The birth weights of compromised scNT piglets in comparison with those of normal scNT piglets are significantly reduced (0.80 +/- 0.29 vs 1.27 +/- 0.30 kg, p < 0.05), in spite of longer gestation (114 versus 120 day). Significant findings from histological examinations showed that approximately 25% (7/28) of scNT piglets showed severe congestion of lung and liver or neutrophilic inflammation in brain indicating that unexpected phenotypes can appear as a result of somatic cell cloning. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments revealed changes in the responses of several detoxification-related proteins related to stress and inflammation and found significant alterations in myocardium-specific proteins, indicating hemodynamic disorder. scNT piglets that survived to adulthood did not show any abnormality except skin and hair color depigmentation. The present study suggests that cerebromeningitis and hemodynamic disorder are a major risk factor for sudden early death of scNT piglets. Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that scNT piglets are susceptible to specific respiratory infections, our data suggests that the early death of scNT clones is due to cardiopulmonary functional abnormalities and cerebromeningitis.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections play a crucial role in the progress of cervical cancer. The high-risk HPV types are frequently associated with the development of malignant lesions. Some of the latest studies have demonstrated that the high-risk HPV 16 and 18 are predominantly detected in the more aggressive cancers. In the present study, we aimed to establish the proteomic profiles and characterization of the tumor related proteins by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). For proteomic analysis, patients infected by HPV 16 or 18 were included in this study. We compared nuclear protein and cytoplasmic protein, separately by using the subcellular fraction. Differential protein spots between cervical cancer with high-risk HPV, HPV 16 or HPV 18, and HaCaT cell lines were characterized by 2-DE. Those proteins analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting based on MALDI-TOF MS and database searching were the products of oncogenes or proto-oncogenes, and the others were involved in the regulation of cell cycle, for general genomic stability, telomerase activation, and cell immortalization. However, there was no difference in protein characterization for cervical cancer between HPV 16 and HPV 18 infection. Nonetheless, these data are valuable for the mass identification of differentially expressed proteins involved in human uterine cervical cancer. Moreover, the data has enormous value for establishing the human uterine cervical cancer proteome database that can be used in screening a molecular marker for the further study of human uterine cervical cancer, and also for studying any correlation among the cancers induced by HPV.

Proteomic analysis of the proteins expressed by hydrogen peroxide treated
cultured human dermal microvascular endothelial cells.

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1507-19.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been traditionally regarded as toxic by-products of aerobic metabolism. However, ROS also act as intracellular signaling molecules and can mediate phenotypes in vascular endothelial cells, which may be physiological or pathological in nature. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of ROS signaling, we examined hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-responsive proteins in cultured human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) using proteomic tools. Protein expression in HMVEC was studied after they had been exposed to low- and high-levels of H(2)O(2) for various times, and intracellular ROS production was examined by flow cytometer and UV spectrophotometer. Proteins obtained from dose- and time-dependent series were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tentatively identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry, by matching the tryptic mass maps obtained with entries in the NCBI and Swiss-Prot protein sequence database. At least 163 proteins were changed by H(2)O(2), and 60 proteins were identified. Oxidative stress triggered dramatic change in the expression of proteins in primary microvessel endothelial cells, and their mapping to cellular process provided a view of the ubiquitous cellular changes elicited by H(2)O(2). These results could provide a framework for the understanding of the mechanisms of cellular redox homeostasis and H(2)O(2) metabolism in microendothelium environment in various biological processes as well as pathological conditions.

Comparative proteome analysis of secretory proteins from pathogenic and
nonpathogenic Listeria species.

Proteomics. 2005 Apr;5(6):1544-57.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Extracellular proteins of bacterial pathogens play a crucial role in the infection of the host. Here we present the first comprehensive validation of the secretory subproteome of the Gram positive pathogen Listeria monocytogenes using predictive bioinformatic and experimental proteomic approaches. The previous original signal peptide (SP) prediction (Glaser et al., Science 2001, 294, 849-852) has been greatly improved by an in-depth analysis using seven different bioinformatic tools. Subsequent careful classification of the resulting data gives a probability dependent annotation of 121 putatively secreted proteins of which 45 are novel. Complementary proteomic analysis using both two-dimensional gel electrophoresis/matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry has identified 105 proteins in the culture supernatant of L. monocytogenes. Among these, we were able to detect all the currently known virulence factors with an SP showing the importance of this subproteome and demonstrating the reliability of the techniques used. The comparison between the L. monocytogenes wildtype and the nonpathogenic species Listeria innocua was performed to reveal proteins probably involved in pathogenicity and/or the adaptation to their respective lifestyles. In addition to the eight known virulence factors, all of which have no orthologous genes in L. innocua, eight additional proteins have been identified that exhibit the typical key feature defining the known listerial virulence factors. Further significant differences between the two species are evident in the group of cell wall and secretory proteins that warrant further study. Our investigation clearly demonstrates that the major difference between the pathogenic and nonpathogenic species, noted in the comparative genome analysis, manifests itself strongest in the secretome.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Chlamydiae are widespread bacterial pathogens responsible for a broad range of diseases, including sexually transmitted infections, pneumonia and trachoma. To validate the existence of hitherto hypothetical proteins predicted from recent chlamydial genome sequencing projects and to examine the patterns of expression of key components at the protein level, we have surveyed the expressed proteome of Chlamydia trachomatis strain L2. A combination of two-dimensional gel analysis, multi-dimensional protein identification (MudPIT) and nanocapillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry allowed a total of 328 chlamydial proteins to be unambiguously assigned. Proteins identified as being expressed in the metabolically inert form, elementary body, of Chlamydia include the entire set of predicted glycolytic enzymes, indicating that metabolite flux rather than de novo synthesis of this pathway is triggered upon infection of host cells. An enzyme central to cell wall biosynthesis was also detected in the intracellular form, reticulate body, of Chlamydia, suggesting that the peptidoglycan is produced during growth within host cells. Other sets of proteins identified include 17 outer membrane-associated proteins of potential significance in vaccine studies and 67 proteins previously annotated as hypothetical or conserved hypothetical. Taken together, >/=35% of the predicted proteome for C. trachomatis has been experimentally verified, representing the most extensive survey of any chlamydial proteome to date.

Silicone/graphite coating for on-target desalting and improved peptide
mapping performance of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass

<ABSTRACT>
In two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomic experiments matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) peptide mass fingerprinting is often the technique of choice in identifying proteins. Here, we present a novel surface coating technique for MALDI-MS targets that improves manual and automatic sample analysis. A mixture of silicone and graphite is spread in the form of a thin layer over the target. Due to the hydrophobicity of the coating, aqueous solutions can be applied to relatively small spots very precisely using a robotic system. At least four times more liquid can be concentrated on the same area compared to uncoated steel targets. alpha-cyano-4-hydrocinnamic acid crystallizes in form of very small crystals evenly distributed over the surface. The search for "hot spots" during the analysis is not necessary, which supports the automatic acquisition of data. The homogeneous crystal layer can be very effectively washed on-target without encountering major sample losses. This efficient washing and the focused application of aqueous samples replace expensive and time-consuming reversed phase micro column based sample clean-ups. When analyzing peptide mixtures, the signal intensities are up to five times higher than with preparations of the same un-desalted samples on steel targets, since four times more sample can be loaded. The mass resolution remains unaffected by the surface coating. After usage the coating can be removed, followed by a new coating avoiding any carry-over of sample to the next analysis. All these properties make the precoating of MALDI-MS targets with a silicone/graphite layer an ideal technique for routine analysis in large-scale proteomic experiments.

<ABSTRACT>
The use of "tri-reagents" allows the concomitant isolation of DNA, RNA, and proteins for a complete molecular characterization of biological samples. The aim of the current study was to perform the comparative evaluation of two-dimensional gel proteomes isolated with or without a tri-reagent protein extraction step before dissolving the samples in the first-dimension electrophoresis buffer. We conclude that the use of tri-reagents increases the amount of protein extracted from the sample. Furthermore, an average of 301 +/- 3.6 spots were found in gels from both sample preparation methods, whereas 71.7 +/- 8.1 and 49.7 +/- 2.3 spots were uniquely seen in tri-reagent and non-tri-reagent samples, respectively.

Comparative analysis of protein aggregates by blue native electrophoresis

Proteomics. 2005 May;5(8):2002-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We describe the comparative analysis of protein aggregates by combining blue native electrophoresis and subsequent sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using a 3-D geometry gel for simultaneous processing of many samples. The first native electrophoresis step, separating the aggregates, is carried out for a series of samples in parallel lanes within a slab gel. This gel is then placed on the top surface of a cylindrical, 3-D geometry gel for the second denaturing electrophoresis step, separating the proteins composing the aggregates. The samples migrate parallel to the vertical axis of the gel cylinder. Data are acquired online by photodetection of laser-induced fluorescence during electrophoresis. For this purpose, the samples are fluorescently labeled within the slab gel after the first separation step. A 3-D geometry gel separates the equivalent of many conventional SDS slab gels represented by vertical layers in the 3-D gel body. In this way, many samples are analyzed in the same gel under identical conditions, improving comparability and resolution and making the process considerably more efficient. This novel technique allowed the identification of several aggregate classes of recombinant proteins expressed in bacteria. We observed that proteins preferentially bind to homolog polypeptides, but also seem to form a trapping mesh co-aggregating with other proteins. The aggregation pattern revealed by this technique supplements data obtained from standard two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis. We expect interesting applications, for instance in aggregate monitoring of clinical samples. It should be feasible to quickly gain a diagnostic picture during amyloid-related neurodegenerative disease development or to observe drug effects on protein aggregation.

<ABSTRACT>
Biomarkers have the potential to impact a wide range of public health concerns, including early detection of diseases, drug discovery, and improved accuracy of monitoring effects of interventions. Given new technological developments, broad-based screening approaches will likely advance biomarker discovery at an accelerated pace. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) allows for the elucidation of individual protein masses from a complex mixture with high throughput. We have developed a method for identifying serum biomarkers using MALDI-TOF and statistical analysis. However, before applying this approach to screening of complex diseases, we evaluated the approach in a controlled dietary intervention study. In this study, MALDI-TOF spectra were generated using samples from a randomized controlled trial. During separate feeding periods, 38 participants ate a basal diet devoid of fruits and vegetables and a basal diet supplemented with cruciferous (broccoli) family vegetables. Serum samples were obtained at the end of each 7-day feeding period and treated to remove large, abundant proteins. MALDI-TOF spectra were analyzed using peak picking algorithms and logistic regression models. Our bioinformatics methods identified two significant peaks at m/z values of 2740 and 1847 that could classify participants based on diet (basal vs. cruciferous) with 76% accuracy. The 2740 m/z peak was identified as the B-chain of alpha 2-HS glycoprotein, a serum protein previously found to vary with diet and be involved in insulin resistance and immune function.

Optimal isoelectric focusing in the alkaline region remains a challenge in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), though various attempts had been made to reduce basic end streaking. The present study reports the application of a novel reduction and alkylation step prior to 2-DE analysis using tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride as a reducing agent and vinylpyridine as an alkylating agent. This simple sample preparation approach effectively eliminates basic end streaks, thereby enabling the analysis and identification of more protein spots resolved by 2-DE.

<ABSTRACT>
A new shotgun proteomics approach was employed to identify degraded proteins. Jurkat T-cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by Fas (CD95/Apo-1) stimulation. The proteins were separated by large (30 cm) sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after digestion of 100 gel slices with trypsin. The molecular masses of the individual gel slices were calculated through the known theoretical masses of the identified proteins. Proteins were defined as degradation candidates if either the empirical determined molecular mass was at most 80% of the theoretical value, or if proteins were identified in clearly different gel slices. In this manner, the degradation of 11 already identified apoptosis-modified proteins was confirmed and nine until now unknown degradation candidate proteins identified. Degradation during apoptosis must be verified by additional techniques such as in vitro caspase assays as shown for nucleolin and Rho GDI 2. The results presented confirm the suitability of a shotgun approach for the identification of putative protease targets.

<ABSTRACT>
PROTICdb is a web-based application, mainly designed to store and analyze plant proteome data obtained by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) and mass spectrometry (MS). The purposes of PROTICdb are (i) to store, track, and query information related to proteomic experiments, i.e., from tissue sampling to protein identification and quantitative measurements, and (ii) to integrate information from the user's own expertise and other sources into a knowledge base, used to support data interpretation (e.g., for the determination of allelic variants or products of post-translational modifications). Data insertion into the relational database of PROTICdb is achieved either by uploading outputs of image analysis and MS identification software, or by filling web forms. 2-D PAGE annotated maps can be displayed, queried, and compared through a graphical interface. Links to external databases are also available. Quantitative data can be easily exported in a tabulated format for statistical analyses. PROTICdb is based on the Oracle or the PostgreSQL Database Management System and is freely available upon request at the following URL: http://moulon.inra.fr/ bioinfo/PROTICdb.

Recent developments in structural proteomics for protein structure

Proteomics. 2005 May;5(8):2056-68.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The major challenges in structural proteomics include identifying all the proteins on the genome-wide scale, determining their structure-function relationships, and outlining the precise three-dimensional structures of the proteins. Protein structures are typically determined by experimental approaches such as X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. However, the knowledge of three-dimensional space by these techniques is still limited. Thus, computational methods such as comparative and de novo approaches and molecular dynamic simulations are intensively used as alternative tools to predict the three-dimensional structures and dynamic behavior of proteins. This review summarizes recent developments in structural proteomics for protein structure determination; including instrumental methods such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, and computational methods such as comparative and de novo structure prediction and molecular dynamics simulations.

<ABSTRACT>
We investigated the cytosolic proteome of inflamed synovial tissue by hierarchical clustering analysis and validated the feasibility of this proteome analysis by identifying proteins that were differentially expressed between rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthropathy (SpA), and osteoarthritis (OA). Synovial biopsy samples were obtained from 18 patients undergoing needle arthroscopy for knee synovitis associated with RA (n = 6) and SpA (n = 6), and for joint effusion of the knee associated with OA (n = 6). Cytosolic proteins were extracted from the tissue and subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Protein expression patterns were statistically analyzed and used for hierarchical cluster analysis. Proteins of interest were independently identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization- and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the complete match set, containing 640 spots, remarkably segregated SpA from RA and OA. Next, we used a subset of spots that was statistically, differentially expressed (P < 0.01), between RA and SpA, SpA and OA, or RA and OA, in both Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test. The dendrograms revealed distinct clustering of RA versus SpA and RA versus OA. Spots that were differentially expressed between the groups were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Fructose bisphosphate aldolase A and alpha-enolase showed higher expression levels in SpA than in OA (P < 0.01). Calgranulin A myeloid related protein-8 (MRP-8) was markedly up-regulated in RA and SpA patients in comparison to OA patients where this spot was below detection limit. The analysis of the cytosolic proteome of synovial tissue is a useful approach to identify disease-associated proteins in chronic inflammatory arthritis.

Proteomics. 2005 May;5(8):2157-66.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Receptor interacting protein (RIP140) is a versatile coregulator for many nuclear receptors and transcription factors. Analysis by liqid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy led to the identification of 11 phosphopeptides from tryptic digests of His6-RIP140 purified from Sf21 insect cells. No phosphopeptides were detected on RIP140 expressed in E. coli in a parallel experiment, suggesting that RIP140 phosphorylation occurred specifically only in eukaryotic cells. The tandem mass spectra of the precursor ions of the phosphopeptides were analyzed to map the exact phosphorylation sites on RIP140. All the phosphopeptides displayed intact phosphate containing y- or b-ion signals along with their beta-eliminated product ions, due to neutral loss of phosphoric acid. Phosphorylation occurred specifically on nine serine and a single threonine residues, including Ser-104, Thr-207, Ser-358, Ser-380, Ser-488, Ser-519, Ser-531, Ser-543, Ser-672, and Ser-1003. No tyrosine phosphorylation was found. These data suggested that the central region of RIP140, one major repressive domain, was extensively modified by phosphorylation. These phosphorylation sites can be the targets in future studies addressing post-translational modification of RIP140 with regards to its biological activities.

Proteomics. 2005 May;5(8):2227-37.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a causative agent of chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The core protein of HCV packages the viral RNA genome to form a nucleocapsid. In addition to its function as a structural protein, core protein is involved in regulation of cellular transcription, virus-induced transformation, and pathogenesis. To gain insights into cellular functions of the core protein by identification of cellular proteins interacting with the core protein, we employed a proteomic approach. Hepatocytes soluble cytoplasmic proteins were applied to the core proteins immobilized on Ni-nitrilotriacetic resin and total bound cellular proteins were resolved by 2-DE. Analyses of interacting proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry allowed identification of 14 cellular proteins binding to the core protein. These proteins include DEAD-box polypeptide 5, similar in function to a known protein identified previously by yeast two-hybrid screening and 13 newly identified cellular proteins. Interestingly, nine protein spots were identified as intermediate microfilament proteins, including cytokeratins (five spots for cytokeratin 8, two for cytokeratin 19, and one for cytokeratin 18) and vimentin. Cytokeratin 8 and vimentin, which were previously shown to be involved in the infection processes of other viruses, were further analyzed to confirm their in vivo interactions with the core protein by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. We discuss the functional implications of the interactions of the core protein with newly identified cellular proteins in HCV infection and pathogenesis.

Water and molecular chaperones act as weak links of protein folding
networks: energy landscape and punctuated equilibrium changes point
towards a game theory of proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Water molecules and molecular chaperones efficiently help the protein folding process. Here we describe their action in the context of the energy and topological networks of proteins. In energy terms water and chaperones were suggested to decrease the activation energy between various local energy minima smoothing the energy landscape, rescuing misfolded proteins from conformational traps and stabilizing their native structure. In kinetic terms water and chaperones may make the punctuated equilibrium of conformational changes less punctuated and help protein relaxation. Finally, water and chaperones may help the convergence of multiple energy landscapes during protein-macromolecule interactions. We also discuss the possibility of the introduction of protein games to narrow the multitude of the energy landscapes when a protein binds to another macromolecule. Both water and chaperones provide a diffuse set of rapidly fluctuating weak links (low affinity and low probability interactions), which allow the generalization of all these statements to a multitude of networks.

Molecular mimicry may contribute to pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with mucosal inflammation and ulceration of the colon. There seems to be no single etiological factor responsible for the onset of the disease. Autoimmunity has been emphasized in the pathogenesis of UC. Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) are common in UC, and recently two major species of proteins immunoreactive to pANCA were detected in bacteria from the anaerobic libraries. This implicates colonic bacterial protein as a possible trigger for the disease-associated immune response. Autoantibodies and T-cell response against human tropomyosin isoform 5 (hTM5), an isoform predominantly expressed in colon epithelial cells, were demonstrated in patients with UC but not in Crohn's colitis. We identified two bacterial protein sequences in NCBI database that have regions of significant sequence homology with hTM5. Our hypothesis is that molecular mimicry may be responsible for the pathogenesis of UC.

RNA silencing: a remarkable parallel to protein-based immune systems in
vertebrates?
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2267-72.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Sequence-specific gene silencing by double-strand RNA has been observed in many eukaryotes. Accumulating data suggest that it is the major antiviral defense mechanism in plants and invertebrates. The discovery that this cellular mechanism is also highly conserved though somewhat impaired in mammals has stimulated debate about the evolution of antiviral systems. Here we suggest that the existence of the interferon response as an evolutionary intermediate could account for both the relative decline of RNA silencing and the development of protein-based immune systems in vertebrates. In addition, we emphasize the opportunities presented by RNA silencing and the deeper understanding of vertebrate antiviral systems that is needed.

Significant species-dependence of P700 redox potential as verified by
spectroelectrochemistry: comparison of spinach and Theromosynechococcus
elongatus.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2273-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The redox potentials of P700, the primary electron donor of photosystem (PS) I, of spinach and Thermosynechococcus elongatus were determined by means of spectroelectrochemistry with an error range of +/-2-3 mV, to find that the redox potential of P700 in T. elongatus is lower by ca. 50 mV as compared with spinach. The shift in the P700 redox potential of PS I core particles prepared by harsh detergent treatments remained to within 10 mV for both organisms. These results show that the 50 mV difference in the P700 redox potential between the two organisms is not a detergent-induced artifact but reflects an intrinsic property of each PS I.

<ABSTRACT>
Both amyloid-prone cystatin and unstable mutant C94A lysozyme were secreted in wild-type and Deltaeps1 Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Amyloid-prone cystatin secreted at much higher level in Deltaeps1 cells than that in wild-type yeast. In parallel, the secretion amount of disulfide bond disrupted mutant C94A lysozyme greatly increased in Deltaeps1 cells although that was apparently low in wild-type yeast cells compared with the secretion amount of wild-type lysozyme. It is interesting that neither the unstable mutant C94A lysozyme nor amyloid-prone cystatin secreted in Deltaeps1 cells maintained their specific activities. These observations lead to the supposition that yeast cells deficient for the protein disulfide isomerase-family-member EPS1 locus secrete more of labile disulfide-containing model proteins.

Pancreatic islet response to hyperglycemia is dependent on peroxisome

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2284-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
This study tests the hypothesis that islet peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) influences insulin secretion. Freshly isolated islets of normoglycemic PPARalpha-null mice display no major alteration of glucose-stimulated insulin release. However, after 24 h of culture in high glucose, PPARalpha-null islets exhibit elevated basal insulin secretion and fail to increase insulin mRNA. 24-h culture with palmitate replicates this phenotype in wild-type islets. The data suggest that PPARalpha is needed to ensure appropriate insulin secretory response in situation of short-term hyperglycemia, likely by maintaining islet lipid homeostasis. As such, islet PPARalpha could contribute to delay the progression of type 2 diabetes.

The chlorophyll-binding protein IsiA is inducible by high light and

stress.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2289-93.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The products of the isiAB operon are a chlorophyll antenna protein (IsiA) and flavodoxin (IsiB), which accumulate in cyanobacteria grown under iron starvation conditions. Here we show that strong light triggers de-repression of isiAB transcription and leads to IsiA and flavodoxin accumulation under iron replete conditions. Genetic deletion of isiAB resulted in a photosensitive phenotype, with accumulation of reactive oxygen species and cell bleaching in high light, while the flavodoxin-deficient isiB null mutant expressing isiA was phototolerant. We conclude that IsiA protects cyanobacteria from photooxidative stress. IsiA is the first example of a chlorophyll antenna protein outside the extended LHC family that is induced transiently by high light and that fulfills a photoprotective role.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Amino acids N137 and P140 in the p51 subunit of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) are part of the beta7-beta8-loop that contributes to the formation of the base of the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI)-binding pocket and makes up a substantial part of the dimerization interface. Amino acid P95 in p66 also markedly contributes to the dimerization binding energy. Nine RT mutants at amino acid 137 were constructed bearing the mutations Y, K, T, D, A, Q, S, H or E. The prolines at amino acid positions 95 and 140 were replaced by alanine in separate enzymes. We found that all mutant RT enzymes showed a dramatically decreased RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. None of the mutant RT enzymes showed marked resistance against any of the clinically used NNRTIs but they surprisingly lost significant sensitivity for NRTIs such as ddGTP. The denaturation analyses of the mutant RTs by urea are suggestive for a relevant role of N137 in the stability of the RT heterodimer and support the view that the beta7-beta8 loop in p51 is a hot spot for RT dimerization and instrumental for efficient polymerase catalytic activity. Consequently, N137 and P140 in p51 and P95 in p66 should be attractive targets in the design of new structural classes of RT inhibitors aimed at compromising the optimal interaction of the beta7-beta8 loop in p51 at the p66/p51 dimerization interface.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Crystal structure of ubiquitous toxin from barley alpha-hordothionin (alpha-HT) has been determined at 1.9A resolution by X-ray crystallography. The primary sequence as well as the NMR solution structure of alpha-HT firmly established that alpha-HT belongs to a family of membrane active plant toxins-thionins. Since alpha-HT crystallized in a space group (P4(1)2(1)2) that is different from the space group (I422) of previously determined alpha(1)- and beta-purothionins, and visocotoxin A3, therefore, it provided independent information on protein-protein interactions that may be relevant to the toxin mechanism. The structure of alpha-HT not only confirms overall architectural features (crambin fold) but also provides an additional confirmation of the role for crucial solute molecules, that were postulated to be directly involved in the mechanism of toxicity for thionins.

<ABSTRACT>
In plant chloroplasts two superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities occur, FeSOD and Cu/ZnSOD, with reciprocal regulation in response to copper availability. This system presents a unique model to study the regulation of metal-cofactor delivery to an organelle. The Arabidopsis thaliana gene AtCCS encodes a functional homolog to yeast Ccs1p/Lys7p, a copper chaperone for SOD. The AtCCS protein was localized to chloroplasts where it may supply copper to the stromal Cu/ZnSOD. AtCCS mRNA expression levels are upregulated in response to Cu-feeding and senescence. We propose that AtCCS expression is regulated to allow the most optimal use of Cu for photosynthesis.

Role of Cys-295 on subunit interactions and allosteric regulation of
phosphofructokinase-2 from Escherichia coli.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2313-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In a previous work, chemical modification of Cys-238 of Escherichia coli Pfk-2 raised concerns on the importance of the dimeric state of Pfk-2 for enzyme activity, whereas modification of Cys-295 impaired the enzymatic activity and the MgATP-induced tetramerization of the enzyme. The results presented here demonstrate that the dimeric state of Pfk-2 is critical for the stability and the activity of the enzyme. The replacement of Cys-238 by either Ala or Phe shows no effect on the kinetic parameters, allosteric inhibition, dimer stability and oligomeric structure of Pfk-2. However, the mutation of Cys-295 by either Ala or Phe provokes a decrease in the k(cat) value and an increment in the K(m) values for both substrates. We suggest that the Cys-295 residue participates in intersubunit interactions in the tetramer since the Cys-295-Phe mutant exhibits higher tetramer stability, which in turn results in an increase in the fructose-6-P concentration required for the reversal of the MgATP inhibition relative to the wild type enzyme.

<ABSTRACT>
A hyperthermophilic and aerobic crenarchaeon, Aeropyrum pernix K1, has two sets of genes possibly encoding 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases. One is encoded in open reading frames (ORFs) ape2126 and ape2128, and the other in ORFs ape1473 and ape1472. The two sets of genes were expressed. The product enzymes, Ape2126/2128 and Ape1473/1472, showed optimal temperatures of 105 and over 110 degrees C, and optimal pHs of 8.5 and 9.0, respectively, using pyruvate as a substrate. Pyruvate, 2-oxobutyrate, and glyoxylate were the best substrates for both enzymes, and additionally Ape1473/1472 was able to act on 2-oxoglutarate, suggesting the enzyme operates in the TCA cycle.

<ABSTRACT>
Peroxiredoxin 5 is a thioredoxin peroxidase ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues. Peroxiredoxin 5 can be addressed intracellularly to mitochondria, peroxisomes, the cytosol and the nucleus. Here, we show that mitochondrial human peroxiredoxin 5 protects mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from oxidative attacks. In an acellular assay, recombinant peroxiredoxin 5 was shown to protect plasmid DNA from damages induced by metal-catalyzed generation of reactive oxygen species. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, overexpression of mitochondrial peroxiredoxin 5 significantly decreased mtDNA damages caused by exogenously added hydrogen peroxide. Altogether our results suggest that mitochondrial peroxiredoxin 5 may play an important role in mitochondrial genome stability.

Heparanase processing by lysosomal/endosomal protein preparation.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2334-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Heparanase is an endo-beta-glucuronodase involved in cleavage of heparan sulfate side chains, activity that is strongly implicated in cell dissemination associated with tumor metastasis and inflammation. Heparanase is first synthesized as a latent 65 kDa precursor that is converted into an active enzyme upon proteolytic processing. Previously, we have reported that elevation of the lysosomal pH results in complete inhibition of heparanase processing, suggesting that lysosomal protease(s) and acidic pH conditions are required for heparanase processing. Here, we adopted a cell fractionation approach and provide evidence that incubation of the pro-enzyme with lysosome/endosome, but not with cytoplasmic fractions resulted in processing and activation of the 65 kDa latent heparanase. Moreover, while the water soluble lysosome/endosome fraction exhibited no apparent processing activity, heparanase processing by the water insoluble lysosome/endosome membrane fraction was readily detected and exhibited the expected pH dependency.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2355-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The G6b gene, located in the human Major Histocompatibility Complex, encodes a receptor of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. In this study, we show using a variety of techniques that the extracellular domain of the G6b protein, containing a single Ig-like domain, binds to heparin with high affinity. In an ELISA assay, this binding was displaceable with soluble heparin with an IC50 value of approximately 0.5 microg/ml. Other sulfated glycans showed weaker or no competition. The observed interaction between G6b and heparin is strongly salt dependent suggesting a mainly electrostatic interaction. Heparin might modulate the interaction of G6b with its as yet unidentified protein ligand.

<ABSTRACT>
Dystroglycan is a central component of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex that links extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton in skeletal muscle. Although dystrophic chicken is well established as an animal model of human muscular dystrophy, the pathomechanism leading to muscular degeneration remains unknown. We show here that glycosylation and laminin-binding activity of alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) are defective in dystrophic chicken. Extensive glycan structural analysis reveals that Galbeta1-3GalNAc and GalNAc residues are increased while Siaalpha2-3Gal structure is reduced in alpha-DG of dystrophic chicken. These results implicate aberrant glycosylation of alpha-DG in the pathogenesis of muscular degeneration in this model animal of muscular dystrophy.

<ABSTRACT>
We have shown previously that calcium could trigger nuclear fragmentation, which was associated with a caspase 3 (C3)-like activity [Juin, P., Pelletier, M., Oliver, L., Tremblais, K., Gregoire, M., Meflah, K. and Vallette, F.M. (1998) Induction of a caspase-3-like activity by calcium in normal cytosolic extracts triggers nuclear apoptosis in a cell-free system. J. Biol. Chem. 273, 17559]. Here, we report that this activation is associated with a non-canonical truncation of C3, which induces a weak DEVDase activity. The cleavage of C3 via calcium-dependent proteolysis is independent of caspase 9; lysate exposure to calcium prevents further cleavage and activation by the cytochrome c and dATP pathway. Altogether, our data suggest that calcium could favour a necrotic mechanism by inducing the generation of a form of C3 insensitive to mitochondrial activation.

<ABSTRACT>
Platelet-activating factor (PAF) augments angiogenesis by promoting the synthesis of various angiogenic factors, via the activation of NF-kappaB. In this study, we investigated the role of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, in PAF-induced angiogenesis. PAF increased mRNA expression, protein synthesis, and MMP-9 activity in ECV304 cells, in a NF-kappaB-dependent manner. PAF increased MMP-9 promoter activity in ECV304, which was inhibited by WEB2107, and NF-kappaB inhibitors. Transfected NF-kappaB subunits, p65 or/and p50, increased luciferase activity in the reporter plasmid MMP-9, resulting in an increase not only of MMP-9 luciferase activity, but also of mRNA expression in MMP-9. MMP-9 or NF-kappaB inhibitors significantly inhibited PAF-induced angiogenesis, in a dose-dependent manner, in an in vivo mouse Matrigel implantation model. In a parallel to the Matrigel implantation study, MMP-9 or NF-kappaB inhibitors inhibited PAF-induced sprouting of porcine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. These data indicate that NF-kappaB-dependent MMP-9 plays a key role in PAF-induced angiogenesis.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2376-82.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In the present paper, we have studied the expression of the Phosphatase and TENsin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and its putative biological role in the sheep ovary. We found by Northern-blot, immunohistochemistry and immunoblot that PTEN is highly expressed in granulosa cells from large differentiated follicles (LF) in comparison with small proliferating follicles (SF) (P < 0.001), with no clear effect of follicle quality. Moreover, the PTEN lipid phosphatase activity is also higher in LF than in SF (P < 0.01). In contrast, levels of the phosphorylated form of AKT (pAKT) are lower in LF than in SF (P < 0.0001). IGF-I and insulin but not FSH, LH or forskolin are able to stimulate the expression of PTEN mRNA (P < 0.001) and protein by ovine granulosa cells after 48 h of culture in vitro. An IGF-1 time course analysis showed that expression of PTEN protein appeared after 12h of culture, concomitant with the fall of the pAKT levels, which peaked after 6h of stimulation with IGF-I. Moreover, transfection experiments showed that overexpression of PTEN in ovine granulosa cells induced a decrease and an increase in E2F and p27 promoter activity, respectively (P < 0.05). Overall, our present data show for the first time that the expression of PTEN increases during terminal follicular growth. This increase, that might be induced by IGF-I but not FSH, would participate in the proliferation/differentiation transition of ovine granulosa cells in differentiating follicles.

<ABSTRACT>
The cold-adapted Pseudomonas fragi lipase (PFL) displays highest activity on short-chain triglyceride substrates and is rapidly inactivated at moderate temperature. Sequence and structure comparison with homologous lipases endowed with different substrate specificity and stability, pointed to three polar residues in the lid region, that were replaced with the amino acids conserved at equivalent positions in the reference lipases. Substitutions at residues T137 and T138 modified the lipase chain-length preference profile, increasing the relative activity towards C8 substrates. Moreover, mutations conferred to PFL higher temperature stability. On the other hand, replacement of the serine at position 141 by glycine destabilized the protein.

<ABSTRACT>
According to the raft hypothesis, sphingolipid-cholesterol (CHOL) microdomains are involved in numerous cellular functions. Here, we have prepared liposomes to simulate the lipid composition of rafts/caveolae using phosphatidylchone, sphingomyelin (SPM)-CHOL in vitro. Experiments of both 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene and merocyanine-540 fluorescence showed that a phase transition from l(d) to l(o) can be observed clearly. In particular, we investigated the behavior of a membrane protein, plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA), in lipid rafts (l(o) phase). Three complementary approaches to characterize the physical appearance of PMCA were employed in the present study. Tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence increase, fluorescence quenching by both acrylamid and hypocrellin B decrease, and MIANS fluorescence decrease, indicate that the conformation of PMCA embedded in lipid l(o) phase is more compact than in lipid l(d) phase. Also, our results showed that PMCA activity decreased with the increase of SPM-CHOL content, in other words, with the increase of l(o) phase. This suggests that the specific domains containing high SPM-CHOL concentration are not a favorable place for PMCA activity. Finally, a possible explanation about PMCA molecules concentrated in caveolae/rafts was discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
SARS-CoV is a newly identified coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Currently, there is no effective method available for prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV infections. In the present study, the influence of small interfering RNA (siRNA) on SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein expression was detected in cultured cells and mouse muscles. Four siRNA expression cassettes driven by mouse U6 promoter targeting SARS-CoV N gene were prepared, and their inhibitory effects on expression of N and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fusion protein were observed. A candidate siRNA was proved to down-regulate N and EGFP expression actively in a sequence-specific manner. The expression vector of this siRNA was constructed and confirmed to reduce N and EGFP expression efficiently in both cultured cells and adult mouse muscles. Our findings suggest that the siRNA should provide the basis for prophylaxis and therapy of SARS-CoV infection in human.

<ABSTRACT>
Apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain is expressed at high levels in brain and myogenic tissues, consistent with a role to inhibit apoptosis in the terminally differentiated cells. Expression of ARC in cancers is not known. In this study, we reported that ARC was highly expressed in various non-myogenic and non-neurogenic human and rat cancer cell lines. Unexpectedly, ARC was localized almost exclusively to the nuclei of cancer cells, which was unlike the cytoplasmic localization of ARC in non-cancer cells. Furthermore, nuclear ARC in cancer cells did not co-localize with nucleolus protein of 30 kDa, an alternatively spliced ARC isoform. These findings indicate that ARC is distributed differently in cancer cells than non-cancer cells and thus might play a role in neoplastic transformation.

Perchloric acid-soluble protein regulates cell proliferation and

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2416-20.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The role of perchloric acid-soluble protein (PSP) was investigated in chick embryos. Fluorescently labeled anti-chick liver (CL)-PSP IgG was injected into the yolk sac in ovo at embryonic day 3, and became localized in neuroepithelial cells. Within 12 h, morphological changes were observed in 37.5% of anti-CL-PSP IgG-injected embryos, and the neuroepithelial cells formed a wavy line. No significant changes were observed in embryos injected with non-immune IgG or PBS. Increased expression of PCNA and decreased expression of neuronal class III beta-tubulin were observed in the spinal cord after anti-CL-PSP IgG injection. These results suggest that PSP controls the proliferation and differentiation of neuroepithelial cells in chick embryos.

Nitration and oligomerization of tau induced by peroxynitrite inhibit its
microtubule-binding activity.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2421-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Abnormally nitrated tau has been found recently in the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether and how nitration of tau is involved in AD pathology is not known. Herein, we found that in vitro incubation of peroxynitrite with recombinant tau resulted in nitration and oligomerization of tau in a dosage-dependent manner. Moreover, the nitrated tau showed a significantly decreased binding activity to taxol-stabilized microtubulesin in vitro. Further study demonstrated that peroxynitrite also induced tau nitration in neuroblastoma N2a cell line, and the nitrated tau was accumulated in the cells. We conclude that abnormal nitration of tau contributes to the impaired biological activity of tau in binding to the microtubules and the aggregation of tau, implying a novel mechanism responsible for the neurodegeneration seen in AD brain.

The subcellular compartmentation of fatty acid transporters is regulated
differently by insulin and by AICAR.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2428-32.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cellular fatty acid uptake is facilitated by a number of fatty acid transporters, FAT/CD36, FABPpm and FATP1. It had been presumed that FABPpm, was confined to the plasma membrane and was not regulated. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that FABPpm and FATP1 are also present in intracellular depots in cardiac myocytes. While we confirmed previous work that insulin and AICAR each induced the translocation of FAT/CD36 from an intracellular depot to the PM, only AICAR, but not insulin, induced the translocation of FABPpm. Moreover, neither insulin nor AICAR induced the translocation of FATP1. Importantly, the increased plasmalemmal content of these LCFA transporters was associated with a concomitant increase in the initial rate of palmitate uptake into cardiac myocytes. Specifically, the insulin-stimulated increase in the rate of palmitate uptake (+60%) paralleled the insulin-stimulated increase in plasmalemmal FAT/CD36 (+34%). Similarly, the greater AICAR-stimulated increase in the rate of palmitate uptake (+90%) paralleled the AICAR-induced increase in both plasmalemmal proteins (FAT/CD36 (+40%)+FABPpm (+36%)). Inhibition of palmitate uptake with the specific FAT/CD36 inhibitor SSO indicated that FABPpm interacts with FAT/CD36 at the plasma membrane to facilitate the uptake of palmitate. In conclusion, (1) there appears to be tissue-specific sensitivity to insulin-induced FATP1 translocation, as it has been shown elsewhere that insulin induces FATP1 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and (2) clearly, the subcellular distribution of FABPpm, as well as FAT/CD36, is acutely regulated in cardiac myocytes, although FABPpm and FAT/CD36 do not necessarily respond identically to the same stimuli.

Reversible PEGylation of peptide YY3-36 prolongs its inhibition of food
intake in mice.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2439-44.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Administration of peptide YY(3-36) (PYY(3-36)) to fasting humans or mice shortly before re-feeding effectively reduced their food intake, but PYY(3-36) exhibited a functional half-life of only approximately 3 h. Attachment of poly(ethylene glycol) to proteins and peptides (PEGylation) prolongs their half-life in vivo, but completely inactivated PYY(3-36). We developed a reversibly PEGylated PYY(3-36) derivative by coupling it to a 40 kDa PEG through a spontaneously cleavable linker. The resulting conjugate (PEG(40)-FMS-PYY(3-36)) gradually released unmodified PYY(3-36) in vivo, exhibiting an eightfold increase in its functional half-life, to approximately 24h. This long-acting PYY(3-36) pro-drug may serve as an effective means for controlling food intake in humans.

The hydrophobic surface of PaAMP from pokeweed seeds is essential to its

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2445-50.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
PaAMP is a small seed-specific antimicrobial protein from pokeweeds. It has a cysteine-knot fold with a positive patch and a hydrophobic surface. Site-specific mutagenesis was performed to study the roles of these two domains in antimicrobial activity and we found that the mutations in the hydrophobic surface had a more profound effect than that in the positive patch. A protein-membrane interaction was observed with the green fluorescence protein-PaAMP (GFP-AMP) fusion protein. The mutations that replace the amino acid residues forming hydrophobic surface with neutral residues abolished the interaction of PaAMP with the membrane and the binding of PaAMP to fungal sphingolipids while ergosterol enhanced the binding, suggesting that the hydrophobic surface was required for the interaction between PaAMP and fungal plasma membrane lipid raft.

Origin, distribution and 3D-modeling of Gr-EXPB1, an expansin from the

<ABSTRACT>
Southern analysis showed that Gr-EXPB1, a functional expansin from the potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis, is member of a multigene family, and EST data suggest expansins to be present in other plant parasitic nematodes as well. Homology modeling predicted that Gr-EXPB1 domain 1 (D1) has a flat beta-barrel structure with surface-exposed aromatic rings, whereas the 3D structure of Gr-EXPB1-D2 was remarkably similar to plant expansins. Gr-EXPB1 shows highest sequence similarity to two extracellular proteins from saprophytic soil-inhabiting Actinobacteria, and includes a bacterial type II carbohydrate-binding module. These results support the hypothesis that a number of pathogenicity factors of cyst nematodes is of procaryotic origin and were acquired by horizontal gene transfer.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
L-Vinylglycine (L-VG) is both a substrate for and a mechanism-based inhibitor of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase. The ratio of the rate constants for catalytic conversion to alpha-ketobutyrate and ammonia to inactivation is 500/1. The crystal structure of the covalent adduct of the inactivated enzyme was determined at 2.25 Angstroms resolution. The active site contains an external aldimine of the adduct of L-VG with the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor. The side chain gamma-carbon of L-VG is covalently bound to the epsilon-amino group of Lys273. This species corresponds to one of the two alternatives proposed by Feng and Kirsch [Feng, L. and Kirsch, J.F. (2000) L-Vinylglycine is an alternative substrate as well as a mechanism-based inhibitor of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase.

Phoslactomycin targets cysteine-269 of the protein phosphatase 2A
catalytic subunit in cells.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
According to the chemical genetic approach, small molecules that bind directly to proteins are used to analyze protein function, thereby enabling the elucidation of complex mechanisms in mammal cells. Thus, it is very important to identify the molecular targets of compounds that induce a unique phenotype in a target cell. Phoslactomycin A (PLMA) is known to be a potent inhibitor of protein Ser/Thr phosphatase 2A (PP2A); however, the inhibitory mechanism of PP2A by PLMA has not yet been elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that PLMA directly binds to the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) in cells by using biotinylated PLMA, and the PLMA-binding site was identified as the Cys-269 residue of PP2Ac. Moreover, we revealed that the Cys-269 contributes to the potent inhibition of PP2Ac activity by PLMA. These results suggest that PLMA is a PP2A-selective inhibitor and is therefore expected to be useful for future investigation of PP2A function in cells.

<ABSTRACT>
The role of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and P2Y(1) nucleotide receptor in potentiating agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) aggregation is being demonstrated in a co-culture system of NG108-15 cell, a mouse neuroblastoma X rat glioma hybrid cell line that resembles spinal motor neuron, with C2C12 myotube. In the co-cultures, antagonized P2Y(1) receptors showed a reduction in NG108-15 cell-induced AChR aggregation. Parallel to this observation, cultured NG108-15 cell secreted ATP into the conditioned medium in a time-dependent manner. Enhancement of ATP release from the cultured NG108-15 cells by overexpression of active mutants of small GTPases increased the aggregation of AChRs in co-culturing with C2C12 myotubes. In addition, ecto-nucleotidase was revealed in the co-culture, which rapidly degraded the applied ATP. These results support the notion that ATP has a role in directing the formation of post-synaptic apparatus in vertebrate neuromuscular junctions.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Histamine is known to act, at least in part, as a growth factor for several cell types, and as production of this biogen amine has been found to accelerate the rate of tissue proliferation in wound repair, embryogenesis and malignant growth. Abundant experimental and clinical data suggest that histamine augments in vivo tumour cell proliferation via histamine H2 receptors (H2R). Here, we report that exogenously added histamine stimulates Ets-1 (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1) synthesis in human melanoma cells. Involvement of histamine receptors in the histamine induced ets-1 expression has been also studied. Our data show that these newly recognized actions of histamine are mediated by the H2R. Modification of local protooncogen Ets-1 level is likely being involved in the regulation of melanoma growth.

<ABSTRACT>
In this study, the human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2A6 was used in order to modify the alkaloid production of tobacco plants. The cDNA for human CYP2A6 was placed under the control of the constitutive 35S promoter and transferred into Nicotiana tabacum via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic plants showed formation of the recombinant CYP2A6 enzyme but no obvious phenotypic changes. Unlike wild-type tobacco, the transgenic plants accumulated cotinine, a metabolite which is usually formed from nicotine in humans. This result substantiates that metabolic engineering of the plant secondary metabolism via mammalian P450 enzymes is possible in vivo.

<ABSTRACT>
Mitochondrial Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) consists of at least 46 subunits. Phosphorylation of the 42-kDa subunit NDUFA10 was recently reported using a novel phosphoprotein stain [Schulenberg et al. (2003) Analysis of steady-state protein phosphorylation in mitochondria using a novel fluorescent phosphosensor dye. J. Biol. Chem. 278, 27251]. Two smaller Complex I phosphoproteins, ESSS and MWFE, and their sites of modification, have since been determined [Chen et al. (2004) The phosphorylation of subunits of complex I from bovine heart mitochondria. J. Biol. Chem. 279, 26036]. Here we identify the site of phosphorylation in NDUFA10 from bovine heart mitochondria by tandem mass spectrometry. A single phosphopeptide spanning residues 47-60 was identified and confirmed by synthesis to be (47)LITVDGNICSGKpSK(60), establishing serine-59 as the site of phosphorylation.

A recombinant diheme SoxAX cytochrome - implications for the relationship
between EPR signals and modified heme-ligands.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2491-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The multiheme SoxAX proteins are notable for their unusual heme ligation (His/Cys-persulfide in the SoxA subunit) and the complexity of their EPR spectra. The diheme SoxAX protein from Starkeya novella has been expressed using Rhodobacter capsulatus as a host expression system. rSoxAX was correctly formed in the periplasm of the host and contained heme c in similar amounts as the native SoxAX. ESI-MS showed that the full length rSoxA, in spite of never having undergone catalytic turnover, existed in several forms, with the two major forms having masses of 28687 +/- 4 and 28718 +/- 4 Da. The latter form exceeds the expected mass of rSoxA by 31 +/- 4 Da, a mass close to that of a sulfur atom and indicating that a fraction of the recombinant protein contains a cysteine persulfide modification. EPR spectra of rSoxAX contained all four heme-dependent EPR signals (LS1a, LS1b, LS2, LS3) found in the native SoxAX proteins isolated from bacteria grown under sulfur chemolithotrophic conditions. Exposure of the recombinant SoxAX to different sulfur compounds lead to changes in the SoxA mass profile as determined by ESI while maintaining a fully oxidized SoxAX visible spectrum. Thiosulfate, the proposed SoxAX substrate, did not cause any mass changes while after exposure to dimethylsulfoxide a +112 +/- 4 Da form of SoxA became dominant in the mass spectrum.

Functional regulation of Na+-dependent neutral amino acid transporter
ASCT2 by S-nitrosothiols and nitric oxide in Caco-2 cells.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2499-506.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We describe the regulation mechanisms of the Na(+)-dependent neutral amino acid transporter ASCT2 via nitric oxide (NO) in the human intestinal cell line, Caco-2. Exposure of Caco-2 cells to S-nitrosothiol, such as S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP) and S-nitrosoglutathione, and the NO-donor, NOC12, concentration- and time-dependently increased Na(+)-dependent alanine uptake. Kinetic analyses indicated that SNAP increases the maximal velocity (V(max)) of Na(+)-dependent alanine uptake in Caco-2 cells without affecting the Michaelis-Menten constant (K(t)). The stimulatory effect was partially eliminated by actinomycin D and cycloheximide. Increased Na(+)-dependent alanine uptake by SNAP was partially abolished by the NO scavengers, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide sodium salt (carboxy-PTIO) and N-(dithiocarboxy)sarcosine disodium salts (DTCS), as well as the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium. RT-PCR revealed that Caco-2 cells expressed the Na(+)-dependent neutral amino acid transporter ASCT2, but not the other Na(+)-dependent neutral amino acid transporters ATB(0,+) and B(0)AT1. These results suggested that functional up-regulation of ASCT2 by SNAP might be partially associated with an increase in the density of transporter protein via de novo synthesis.

<ABSTRACT>
Isoprene synthase cDNA from Populus alba (PaIspS) was isolated by RT-PCR. This PaIspS mRNA, which was predominantly observed in the leaves, was strongly induced by heat stress and continuous light irradiation, and was substantially decreased in the dark, suggesting that isoprene emission was regulated at the transcriptional level. The subcellular localization of PaIspS protein with green fluorescent protein fusion was shown to be in plastids. PaIspS expressed in Escherichia coli was characterized enzymatically: it had an optimum pH of approximately 8.0, and an optimum temperature 40 degrees C. Its preference for divalent cations for its activity was also studied.

The centromere is an essential structure in the chromosomes of all eukariotes and is central to the mechanism that ensures proper segregation during mitosis and meiosis. The comparison of DNA sequence motifs, organization and kinetocore components from yeast to man is beginning to indicate that, although centromeres are highly variable DNA elements, a conserved pattern of sequence arrangement and function is emerging. We have identified and characterized the first satellite DNA (P.k.SAT) from microbat species Pipistrellus kuhli. The presence of mammalian CENP-B box and yeast CDEIII box could indicate the participation of P.k.SAT in centromere organization.

<ABSTRACT>
It is relevant to cell physiology that nitric oxide (NO) reacts with both cytochrome oxidase (CcOX) and oxygenated myoglobin (MbO(2)). In this respect, it has been proposed [Pearce, L.L., et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 13556-13562] that (i) CcOX in turnover out-competes MbO(2) for NO, and (ii) NO bound to reduced CcOX is "metabolized" in the active site to nitrite by reacting with O(2). In contrast, rapid kinetics experiments reported in this study show that (i) upon mixing NO with MbO(2) and CcOX in turnover, MbO(2) out-competes the oxidase for NO and (ii) after mixing nitrosylated CcOX with O(2) in the presence of MbO(2), NO (and not nitrite) dissociates from the enzyme causing myoglobin oxidation.

H2O2 activates Nox4 through PLA2-dependent arachidonic acid production in
adult cardiac fibroblasts.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Apr 25;579(11):2533-40.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Stimulated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by plasma membrane-associated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases (Nox) in non-phagocytic cells regulates a number of biological processes including growth, vessel tone, and oxygen sensing. The purpose of this study was to investigate H(2)O(2)-stimulated ROS production in primary adult cardiac fibroblasts (CF). Results demonstrate that CF express an H(2)O(2)-inducible oxidant generating system that is inhibitable by diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and sensitive to antioxidants. In addition to H(2)O(2), generation of ROS was stimulated potently by 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) and arachidonic acid (AA) in a protein kinase C-independent manner. Pretreatment with arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone was nearly as effective as DPI at reducing H(2)O(2)- and OAG-stimulated oxidant generation indicating a central role for phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) in this signaling pathway. Co-stimulation with H(2)O(2) and OAG did not increase ROS generation as compared to OAG alone suggesting both agonists signal through a shared, rate-limited enzymatic pathway involving PLA(2). Co-stimulation with H(2)O(2) and AA had additive effects indicating these two agonists stimulate oxidant production through a parallel activation pathway. Reverse transcriptase-coupled polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting demonstrate primary cardiac fibroblasts express transcripts and protein for Nox4, p22, p47, and p67 phox. Transfections with Nox4 small inhibitory ribonucleic acid oligonucleotides or p22 phox antisense oligonucleotides significantly downregulated stimulated Nox activity. Inhibitors of nitric oxide synthases were without effect. We conclude adult CF express Nox4/p22 phox-containing oxidant generating complex activated by H(2)O(2), OAG, and AA through a pathway that requires activation of PLA(2).

<ABSTRACT>
Proteome analysis of human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues was conducted using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. Paired samples from the normal and tumor region of resected human liver were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively while the pooled standard sample was labeled with Cy2. After analysis by the DeCyder software, protein spots that exhibited at least a two-fold difference in intensity were excised for in-gel tryptic digestion and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. A total of 6 and 42 proteins were successfully identified from the well- and poorly-differentiated samples, respectively. The majority of these proteins are related to detoxification/oxidative stress and metabolism. Three down-regulated metabolic enzymes, methionine adenosyltransferase, glycine N-methyltransferase, and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase that are involved in the methylation cycle in the liver are of special interest. Their expression levels, especially, methionine adenosyltransferase, seemed to have a major influence on the level of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a vital intermediate metabolite required for the proper functioning of the liver. Recent work has shown that chronic deficiency in AdoMet in the liver results in spontaneous development of steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and hence the down-regulation of hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase in our hepatocellular carcinoma samples is in line with this observation. Moreover, when a comparison is made between the differentially expressed proteins from our human hepatocellular carcinoma samples and from the liver tissues of knockout mice deficient in methionine adenosyltransferase, there is a fairly good correlation between them.

<ABSTRACT>
Protein profiles of cultured cystic fibrosis (CF) lung epithelial cells were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS). The analysis gave rise to a protein map over the pI range of 4-7, and a molecular weight range of ca. 100-10 kDa. The map contains 194 identified proteins, which were detectable by silver stain. All silver stained features were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight MS of tryptic peptides. Some proteins were found to be represented by multiple features on the 2-D gel. Among the high abundance proteins identified were sets of proteins associated with inflammation, including the classical NFkappaB, p65 (RelA) and NFkappaB, p65 (RelB). We suggest that this composite atlas of the high abundance CF lung epithelial proteome will serve as a reference database for future studies of candidate CF drugs, validating different approaches to CFTR gene therapy, and analogous investigations of other types of human lung disorders.

<ABSTRACT>
The basic problem of complexity poses a significant challenge for proteomic studies. To date two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by enzymatic in-gel digestion of the peptides, and subsequent identification by mass spectrometry (MS) is the most commonly used method to analyze complex protein mixtures. However, 2-DE is a slow and labor-intensive technique, which is not able to resolve all proteins of a proteome. To overcome these limitations gel-free approaches are developed based on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). The high resolution and excellent mass accuracy of FT-ICR MS provides a basis for simultaneous analysis of numerous compounds. In the present study, a small protein subfraction of an Escherichia coli cell lysate was prepared by size-exclusion chromatography and proteins were analyzed using C4 reversed phase (RP)-HPLC for pre-separation followed by C18 RP nanoHPLC/nanoESI FT-ICR MS for analysis of the peptide mixtures after tryptic digestion of the protein fractions. We identified 231 proteins and thus demonstrated that a combination of two RP separation steps - one on the protein and one on the peptide level - in combination with high-resolution FT-ICR MS has the potential to become a powerful method for global proteomics studies.

<ABSTRACT>
Proteins are essential to rice caryopsis development and quality formation. High temperature is an important environmental factor, which may decrease grain quality. In the present study rice caryopsis proteins were profiled by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and differentially expressed proteins were analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Expressions of more than 400 polypeptide spots during caryopsis development, in response to temperature treatments or between varieties were monitored. Among them, more than 70 differentially expressed polypeptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. We identified 54 proteins with known functions. Of these, 21 were involved with carbohydrate metabolism, 14 with protein synthesis and sorting, and 9 with stress responses. Waxy (Wx) proteins and glutelins were the most significant spots, which increased significantly during development. Allergen-like proteins, PPDK and NADH-SDH, also were expressed during development, implying their physiological roles in caryopsis. Expression of large isoforms of Wx proteins was correlated with the amylose content of rice caryopses. One protein with high GC content in its DNA sequence was correlated with the chalky trait of kernels. High temperature (35/30 degrees C) decreased the expression of Wx proteins, allergen-like proteins, and elongation factor 1beta, but increased the expression of small heat shock proteins (sHSP), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and prolamin. sHSP was positively correlated with the appearance of chalky kernels. During development, glutelins were phosphorylated and glycosylated, indicating that these molecules were post-translationally modified. Possible functions of the expression of candidate proteins on the grain quality are discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
Cervical carcinoma is one of the most prevalent cancers in women worldwide, and human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 is the most common agent linked to human cervical carcinoma. In order to identify various relevant factors affected by the E7 oncogene, we established a stable cell line, which constitutively expressed E7 using the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line. The increased expression and activity of catalase in the E7-expressing HaCaT cells (HaCaT/E7) were verified via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight, Western blot, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses. The regulation of catalase by E7 was investigated by the detection of catalase promoter activity. E7 enhanced the activities of both the catalase promoter and nuclear factor-kappaB, one of the major transcription factors regulating the expression of the catalase gene. HaCaT/E7 cells produced lower quantities of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and appeared to be more resistant to H(2)O(2)-induced cell death. Moreover, in order to test the specific effects of E7 on catalase induction, the HaCaT/E7 cells were transiently transfected with E7 antisense vector, resulting in reductions in both the expression and activity of catalase, and a recovery of intracellular ROS levels, thus resulting in recovered sensitivity to H(2)O(2)-induced cell death. These results suggest that the HPV 16 E7 oncogene induces higher resistance to ROS-induced cell injury in the E7-infected cells, probably via the modulation of several anti-oxidant enzymes, including catalase.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Previous findings from our laboratory and others indicate that two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) can be used to study protein expression in defined brain regions, but mainly the proteins which are present in high abundance in glia are readily detected. The current study was undertaken to determine the protein profile in a synaptosomal subcellular fraction isolated from the cerebral cortex of the rat. Both 2-DE and liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) procedures were used to isolate and identify proteins in the synaptosomal fraction and accordingly >900 proteins were detected using 2-DE; the 167 most intense gel spots were isolated and identified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization - time of flight peptide mass fingerprinting or LC-MS/MS. In addition, over 200 proteins were separated and identified with the LC-MS/MS "shotgun proteomics" technique, some in post-translationally modified form. The following classes of proteins associated with synaptic function were detected: (a) proteins involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking-docking (e.g., SNAP-25, synapsin I and II, synaptotagmin I, II, and V, VAMP-2, syntaxin 1A and 1B, etc.); (b) proteins that function as transporters or receptors (e.g., excitatory amino acid transporters 1 and 2, GABA transporter 1); (c) proteins that are associated with the synaptic plasma membrane (e.g., post-synaptic density-95/synapse-associated protein-90 complex, neuromodulin (GAP-43), voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein (VDACs), sodium-potassium ATPase subunits, alpha 2 spectrin, septin 7, etc.); and (d) proteins that mediate intracellular signaling cascades that modulate synaptic function (e.g., calmodulin, calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase subunits, etc.). Other identified proteins are associated with mitochondrial or general cytosolic function. Of the two proteins identified as endoplasmic reticular, both interact with the synaptic SNARE complex to regulate vesicle trafficking. Taken together, these results suggest that the integrity of the synaptosomes was maintained during the isolation procedure and that this subcellular fractionation technique enables the enrichment of proteins associated with synaptic function. The results also suggest that this experimental approach can be used to study the differential expression of multiple proteins involved in alterations of synaptic function.

<ABSTRACT>
We have investigated the use of a variety of different techniques to identify as many proteins as possible in a yeast lysate, with the aim of investigating the overlap and complementarity of data from different approaches. A standard lysate was prepared from log phase yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). This was then subjected to analysis via five different approaches aimed at identifying as many proteins as possible using an ion trap mass spectrometer. The total number of non-redundant protein identifications from each experiment was: 524 proteins by 2-D (SCX/C18) nanoflow liquid chromatography-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-LC MS/MS (MudPIT)); 381 proteins by nanoLC-MS/MS with gas phase fractionation by mass range selection; 390 proteins by nanoLC-MS/MS with gas phase fractionation by ion abundance selection; 898 proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) separation of proteins, in-gel digestion, and nanoLC-MS/MS of gel slices; and 422 proteins by isoelectric focusing of proteins, in-gel digestion and nanoLC-MS/MS of gel slices. The total number of non-redundant protein identifications in the five experiments was 1204. Combining only the two best experiments, the SDS-PAGE gel slices and the Mudpit, produces 1024 proteins identified, more than 85% of the total. Clearly, combining a Mudpit analysis with an SDS-PAGE gel slice experiment gives the greatest amount of protein identification information from a limited amount of sample.

Proteome analysis of brown spider venom: identification of loxnecrogin
isoforms in Loxosceles gaucho venom.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 May;5(8):2167-76.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Brown spiders of the Loxosceles genus are distributed worldwide. In Brazil, eight species are found in Southern states, where the envenomation by Loxosceles venom (loxoscelism) is a health problem. The mechanism of the dermonecrotic action of Loxosceles venom is not totally understood. Two isoforms of dermonecrotic toxins (loxnecrogins) from L. gaucho venom have been previously purified, and showed sequence similarities to sphingomyelinase. Herein we employed a proteomic approach to obtain a global view of the venom proteome, with a particular interest in the loxnecrogin isoforms' pattern. Proteomic two-dimensional gel electrophoresis maps for L. gaucho, L. intermedia, and L. laeta venoms showed a major protein region (30-35 kDa, pI 3-10), where at least eight loxnecrogin isoforms could be separated and identified. Their characterization used a combined approach composed of Edman chemical sequencing, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, and electrospray ionization-quadropole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry leading to the identification of sphingomyelinases D. The venom was also pre-fractionated by gel filtration on a Superose 12 fast protein liqiud chromatography column, followed by capillary liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Eleven possible loxnecrogin isoforms around 30-32 kDa were detected. The identification of dermonecrotic toxin isoforms in L. gaucho venom is an important step towards understanding the physiopathology of the envenomation, leading to improvements in the immunotherapy of loxoscelism.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Neisseria meningitidis is the most common cause of meningitis and causes epidemic outbreaks. One trait of N. meningitidis, which is associated with most of the currently recognized virulence determinants, is the presence of phase-variable genes that are suspected to enhance its ability to cause an invasive disease. To detect the immune responses to phase-variable expressed proteins, we applied protein microarray technology for the screening of meningitis patient sera. We amplified all 102 known phase-variable genes from N. meningitidis serogroup B strain MC58 by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned them for expression in Escherichia coli. With this approach, we were able to express and purify 67 recombinant proteins representing 66% of the annotated genes. These were spotted robotically onto coated glass slides to generate protein microarrays, which were screened using 20 sera of patients suffering from meningitis, as well as healthy controls. From these screening experiments, 47 proteins emerged as immunogenic, exhibiting a variable degree of seroreactivity with some of the patient sera. Nine proteins elicited an immune response in more than three patients, with one of them, the phase-variable opacity protein OpaV (NMB0442), showing responses in 11 patient sera. This is the first time that protein microarray technology has been applied for the investigation of genetic phase variation in pathogens. The identification of disease-specific proteins is a significant target in biomedical research, as such proteins may have medical, diagnostic, and commercial potential as disease markers.

Proteomic identification of ubiquitinated proteins from human cells

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 May;5(8):2104-11.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A proteomics method has been developed to purify and identify the specific proteins modified by ubiquitin (Ub) from human cells. In purified samples, Ub and 21 other proteins were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) spectra using SEQUEST. These proteins included several of the expected carriers of Ub including Ub-conjugating enzymes and histone proteins. To perform these experiments, a cell line coexpressing epitope tagged His(6X)-Ub and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was generated by stably transfecting HEK293 cells. Ubiquitinated proteins were purified using nickel-affinity chromatography and digested in solution with trypsin. Complex mixtures of peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography and analyzed by nano LC-MS/MS using the LCQ quadrupole ion-trap mass spectrometer. Proteins identified from His(6X)-Ub-GFP transfected cells were compared to a list of proteins from HEK293 cells, which associate with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose in the absence of His-tagged Ub. In a proof of principle experiment, His(6X)-Ub-GFP transfected cells were treated with As (III) (10 microM, 24 h) in an attempt to identify substrates increasingly modified by Ub. In this experiment, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a DNA repair protein and known ubiquitin substrate, was confidently identified. This proteomics method, developed for the analysis of ubiquitinated proteins, is a step towards large-scale characterization of Ub-protein conjugates in numerous physiological and pathological states.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Polyploidization is a major evolutionary process in eukaryotes. In plants, genetic and epigenetic changes occur rapidly after formation of allopolyploids. Hybridization, rather than genome doubling itself, is considered as the main cause for the resulting differential gene expression. We studied the consequences of genome doubling alone in an autopolyploid model, by comparing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) gels of haploid, diploid, and tetraploid Brassica oleracea cabbages. Two fully homozygous lines, HDEM and RC, as well as two organs, leaf and stem, were studied. For the 558 common spots found present in all the 29 2-DE gels of the experiment, inter-organ and -genotype differences were the major sources of the variation in protein amounts: 41 and 10-13%, respectively. HDEM leaf and stem proteomes were not significantly affected by the ploidy level, since no qualitative variation was detected and since the number of quantitative variations could be due to chance. For RC, no qualitative variations were observed, but a few spots were significantly variable in protein amount. However, the number of inter-ploidy variations was of the same range as the number of intra-ploidy variations. In conclusion, whatever the ploidy level, leaf and stem proteomes remained globally unchanged in both cabbage lines.

Why females live longer than males? Importance of the upregulation of

FEBS Lett. 2005 May 9;579(12):2541-5. Epub 2005 Apr 14.

<ABSTRACT>
Females live longer than males in many mammalian species, including humans. Mitochondria from females produce approximately half the amount of H(2)O(2) than males. We have found that females behave as double transgenics overexpressing both superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. This is due to oestrogens that act by binding to the estrogen receptors and subsequently activating the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signalling pathways. Phytoestrogens mimic the protective effect of oestradiol using the same signalling pathway. The critical importance of upregulating antioxidant genes, by hormonal and dietary manipulations, in order to increase longevity is discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
Lipid protein interactions play a key role in the stability and function of various membrane proteins. Earlier we have reported the extreme thermal stability of porin from Paracoccus denitrificans reconstituted into liposomes. Here, we used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for a label free analysis of the global secondary structural changes and local changes in the tyrosine microenvironment. Our results show that a mixed lipid system (non-uniform bilayer) optimizes the thermal stability of porin as compared to the porin in pure lipids (uniform bilayer) or detergent micelles. This is in line with the fact that the bacterial outer membrane is a dynamic system made up of lipids of varying chain lengths, head groups and the barrel wall height contacting the membrane is uneven.

<ABSTRACT>
Here, we report that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A secretion by human airway smooth muscle cells was increased by interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta). IL-1beta and TGFbeta induced cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 protein and increased prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). Both IL-1beta and TGFbeta increased VEGF-A(165) mRNA and VEGF promoter luciferase construct activity, in addition VEGF-A protein was inhibited by actinomycin D suggesting transcriptional regulation. The COX inhibitors indomethacin and NS398 inhibited IL-1beta but not TGFbeta mediated VEGF-A production. Furthermore, the effect of the COX inhibitors was overcome by adding exogenous PGE(2). In conclusion, IL-1beta increases VEGF-A secretion by COX-2 derived PGE(2) production whereas TGFbeta uses COX-independent pathways.

<ABSTRACT>
Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (Smurf2), a ubiquitin ligase for Smads, plays critical roles in the regulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-Smad signaling via ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Smad2 and Smad7. We found that TGF-beta stimulates Smurf2 expression. TGF-beta activated the Smurf2 promoter in a TGF-beta responsive cell lines, whereas IL-1alpha, PDGF and epidermal growth factor did not. TGF-beta-mediated Smurf2 promoter activation was inhibited by Smad7 or an activin receptor-like kinase 5 inhibitor but not by dominant negative Smad or disruption of Smad-binding elements in the promoter. Moreover, inhibition of the phosphatidil inositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway suppressed TGF-beta-mediated Smurf2 induction. These results suggest that TGF-beta stimulates Smurf2 expression by Smad-independent pathway such as PI3K/Akt pathway via TGF-beta receptor.

<ABSTRACT>
Immunization against the Abeta peptide reverses the pathologic and behavioral manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in murine models. Since active immunization is associated with an autoimmune meningoencephalitis in a subset of humans, passive transfer of anti-Abeta immunoglobulin is being pursued as a potentially safer alternative. We have identified cases of meningoencephalitis subsequent to peripheral and intracerebral passive immunization of Tg2576 mice. The vasocentric mononuclear infiltrate localized only to brain regions affected by Abeta amyloid deposits suggesting that the inflammatory reaction was Abeta specific. This report indicates that current passive immunization in humans should proceed with careful regard for autoimmune complications.

Fibroblasts are a diverse cell type and display clear topographic differentiation and positional memory. In a screen for fibroblast specific markers we have characterized four monoclonal antibodies to endosialin (TEM1/CD248). Previous studies have reported that endosialin is a tumour endothelium marker and is localized intracellularly. We demonstrate conclusively that endosialin is a cell surface glycoprotein and is predominantly expressed by fibroblasts and a subset of pericytes associated with tumour vessels but not by tumour endothelium. These novel antibodies will facilitate the isolation and classification of fibroblast and pericyte lineages as well as the further functional analysis of endosialin.

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) via Smad activation in mesangial cells. We recently reported that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) induces CTGF expression in rat cultured mesangial cells. However, the mechanism by which S1P induces CTGF expression is unknown. The present study revealed that S1P-induced CTGF expression is mediated via pertussis toxin-insensitive pathways, which are involved in the activation of small GTPases of the Rho family and protein kinase C. We also showed by luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation that S1P induces CTGF expression via Smad activation as TGF-beta does.

<ABSTRACT>
We quantified the effect of Mg(2+) on thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) binding to TPP-dependent thiA riboswitch RNA. The association constant of TPP binding to the riboswitch at 20 degrees C increased from 1.2 x 10(6) to 50 x 10(6) M(-1) as the Mg(2+) concentration increased from 0 to 1 mM. Furthermore, circular dichroic spectra under various conditions showed that 1 mM Mg(2+) induced a local structural change of the riboswitch, which might be pivotal for TPP binding. These results indicate that a physiological concentration of Mg(2+) can regulate TPP binding to the thiA riboswitch.

<ABSTRACT>
The polymorphism at residue 129 of the human PRNP gene modulates disease susceptibility and the clinico-pathological phenotypes in human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The molecular mechanisms by which the effect of this polymorphism are mediated remain unclear. It has been shown that the folding, dynamics and stability of the physiological, alpha-helix-rich form of recombinant PrP are not affected by codon 129 polymorphism. Consistent with this, we have recently shown that the kinetics of amyloid formation do not differ between protein containing methionine at codon 129 and valine at codon 129 when the reaction is initiated from the alpha-monomeric PrP(C)-like state. In contrast, we have shown that the misfolding pathway leading to the formation of beta-sheet-rich, soluble oligomer was favoured by the presence of methionine, compared with valine, at position 129. In the present work, we examine the effect of this polymorphism on the kinetics of an alternative misfolding pathway, that of amyloid formation using partially folded PrP allelomorphs. We show that the valine 129 allelomorph forms amyloids with a considerably shorter lag phase than the methionine 129 allelomorph both under spontaneous conditions and when seeded with pre-formed amyloid fibres. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that the effect of the codon 129 polymorphism depends on the specific misfolding pathway and on the initial conformation of the protein. The inverse propensities of the two allelomorphs to misfold in vitro through the alternative oligomeric and amyloidogenic pathways could explain some aspects of prion diseases linked to this polymorphism such as age at onset and disease incubation time.

Given the importance of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R)/Ca(2+) channels in the control of intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations, we determined the relative concentrations of the IP(3)R isoforms in subcellular organelles, based on serially sectioned electron micrographs. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was estimated to contain 15-20% of each of the three IP(3)R isoforms while secretory granules contained 58-69%. The nucleus contained approximately 15% each of IP(3)R-1 and -2, but 25% of IP(3)R-3, whereas the plasma membrane contained approximately 1% or less of each. These suggested that secretory granules, the nucleus and ER are at the center of IP(3)-dependent intracellular Ca(2+) control mechanisms in chromaffin cells.

Induction of IGFBP-1 expression by amino acid deprivation of HepG2 human
hepatoma cells involves both a transcriptional activation and an mRNA
stabilization due to its 3'UTR.

<ABSTRACT>
A dramatic overexpression of IGFBP-1 is responsible for growth inhibition, in response to a low-protein diet feeding. It has been demonstrated that a fall in the amino acid concentration was directly responsible for IGFBP-1 induction. In this report, we sought to determine the mechanism by which amino acid limitation upregulates IGFBP-1 expression. Our results show that both transcriptional activation and mRNA stabilization are involved. We also demonstrate that (i) the mGCN2/ATF4 pathway is not involved in this regulation and (ii) the 3'UTR of IGFBP-1 mRNA is responsible for its destabilization and regulates its stability in response to amino acid starvation.

<ABSTRACT>
Borrelia burgdorferi and other spirochetes contain a class I lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), in contrast to most eubacteria that have a canonical class II LysRS. We analyzed tRNA(Lys) recognition by B. burgdorferi LysRS, using two complementary approaches. First, the nucleotides of B. burgdorferi tRNA(Lys) in contact with B. burgdorferi LysRS were determined by enzymatic footprinting experiments. Second, the kinetic parameters for a series of variants of the B. burgdorferi tRNA(Lys) were then determined during aminoacylation by B. burgdorferi LysRS. The identity elements were found to be mostly located in the anticodon and in the acceptor stem. Transplantation of the identified identity elements into the Escherichia coli tRNA(Asp) scaffold endowed lysylation activity on the resulting chimera, indicating that a functional B. burgdorferi lysine tRNA identity set had been determined.

Quantitative aspects of endocytic activity in lipid-mediated
transfections.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 May 9;579(12):2635-42. Epub 2005 Apr 9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Variation in transfection efficiency observed in different cell-types is poorly understood. To investigate the influence of endocytic activity on lipid-mediated transfections, we have monitored both the processes in 12 different cell-types. The endocytic activity shows a strong positive correlation (P < 0.01), with transfection efficiency. Treatment with wortmannin resulted in cell-type-dependent inhibition of transfection. Studies on M-phase cells by confocal microscopy show that compared to interphase cells, uptake of cationic liposomes was substantially reduced. In addition, transfection efficiency of cells in mitotic phase was inhibited by >70% compared to controls. Our study based on several cell-types demonstrates for the first time that quantitative aspects of endocytosis have decisive influence on the overall process of lipid-mediated transgene expression.

Functionality of nitrated acetylcholine receptor: the two-step formation
of nitrotyrosines reveals their differential role in effectors binding.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 May 9;579(12):2643-7. Epub 2005 Apr 9.

<ABSTRACT>
The presence of nitrotyrosines is associated with several neurodegenerative pathologies. We evaluated the functionality of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor possessing nitrotyrosines. The spectrum of the nitrated receptor displays an absorption band characteristic of ortho-nitrophenol. The presence of carbamylcholine in the agonist site prevented the effect of nitration by tetranitromethane in some conditions. The nitration occurred with two discrete steps and pointed out the differential involvement of tyrosines in the binding of acetylcholine and neurotoxin. We concluded that at least two residues involved in agonist binding can be nitrated, which bring similar contributions to the binding energy of the neurotransmitter.

FEBS Lett. 2005 May 9;579(12):2648-56. Epub 2005 Apr 9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Arabidopsis Ca(2+)/H(+) antiporters cation exchanger (CAX) 1 and 2 utilise an electrochemical gradient to transport Ca(2+) into the vacuole to help mediate Ca(2+) homeostasis. Previous whole plant studies indicate that activity of Ca(2+)/H(+) antiporters is regulated by pH. However, the pH regulation of individual Ca(2+)/H(+) antiporters has not been examined. To determine whether CAX1 and CAX2 activity is affected by pH, Ca(2+)/H(+) antiport activity was measured in vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from yeast heterologously expressing either transporter. Ca(2+) transport by CAX1 and CAX2 was regulated by cytosolic pH and each transporter had a distinct cytosolic pH profile. Screening of CAX1/CAX2 chimeras identified an amino acid domain within CAX2 that altered the pH-dependent Ca(2+) transport profile so that it was almost identical to the pH profile of CAX1. Results from mutagenesis of a specific His residue within this domain suggests a role for this residue in pH regulation.

Catalytic properties of glutathione-binding residues in a tau class

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Glutathione transferases (GSTs) play important roles in stress tolerance and detoxification in plants. However, there is extremely little information on the molecular characteristics of GSTs in gymnosperms. In a previous study, we cloned a tau class GST (PtGSTU1) from a gymnosperm (Pinus tabulaeformis) for the first time. Based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence identity to the available crystal structures of plant tau GSTs, Ser13, Lys40, Ile54, Glu66 and Ser67 of PtGSTU1 were proposed as glutathione-binding (G-site) residues. The importance of Ser13 as a G-site residue was investigated previously. The functions of Lys40, Ile54, Glu66 and Ser67 of PtGSTU1 are examined in this study through site-directed mutagenesis. Enzyme assays and thermal stability measurements on the purified recombinant PtGSTU1 showed that substitution at each of these sites significantly affects the enzyme's substrate specificity and affinity for GSH, and these residues are essential for maintaining the stability of PtGSTU1. The results of protein expression and refolding analyses suggest that Ile54 is involved in the protein folding process. The findings demonstrate that the aforementioned residues are critical components of active sites that contribute to the enzyme's catalytic activity and structural stability.

<ABSTRACT>
Ribonuclease A (RNase A) dimers have been recently found to be endowed with some of the special, i.e., non-catalytic biological activities of RNases, such as antitumor and aspermatogenic activities. These activities have been so far attributed to RNases which can escape the neutralizing action of the cytosolic RNase inhibitor (cRI). However, when the interactions of the two cytotoxic RNase A dimers with cRI were investigated in a quantitative fashion and at the molecular level, the dimers were found to bind cRI with high affinity and to form tight complexes.

FEBS Lett. 2005 May 9;579(12):2669-74. Epub 2005 Apr 14.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Exposure to limiting oxygen in cells and tissues induce the stabilization and transcriptional activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein, a key regulator of the hypoxic response. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation has been implicated in the stabilization of HIF-1alpha during this response, but this is still a matter of some debate. In this study we utilize a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, mitoubiquinone (MitoQ), and examine its effects on the hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1alpha. Our results show that under conditions of reduced oxygen (3% O(2)), MitoQ ablated the hypoxic induction of ROS generation and destabilized HIF-1alpha protein. This in turn led to an abrogation of HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Normoxic stabilization of HIF-1alpha, on the other hand, was unchanged in the presence of MitoQ suggesting that ROS were not involved. This study strongly suggests that mitochondrial ROS contribute to the hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1alpha.

<ABSTRACT>
The P2X(7) gene is important for the innate immune response but known polymorphisms do not explain all subjects with loss of P2X(7) function. A splice site mutation (g-->t) was found at position +1 of the first intron of the P2X(7) gene in 7 of 336 Caucasians and 1 of 39 subjects of Indian ethnicity. All eight subjects were heterozygous for the uncommon 1513A-->C polymorphism of the P2X(7) gene. RT-PCR and sequencing showed the splice site mutation was on the 1513C allele in the Caucasians and on the 1513A allele in the Indian subject. The splice site mutation is an inherited polymorphism and gives rise to a P2X(7) null allele in 1-2% of the Caucasian population.

<ABSTRACT>
The second messenger cyclic Adenosine MonoPosphate (cAMP) mediates many biological process by interacting with structurally conserved nucleotide binding domains (cNBD's). Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations on RIIbeta-PKA, one of the best characterized members of the cNBD family, in presence and absence of cAMP. The results of our calculations are fully consistent with the available experimental data and suggest that the key factor of the cAMP allosteric mechanism in cNBDS's is the increased flexibility of the protein upon ligand release along with a mechanical coupling between helical segments. In addition, our calculations provide a rationale for the experimentally observed cAMP selective binding to PKA.

<ABSTRACT>
The matrix protein M of Borna disease virus (BDV) is a constituent of the viral envelope covering the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer. BDV-M was expressed as recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity and structurally analyzed. Recombinant M (i) forms non-covalently bound multimers with a Stoke's radius of 35 Angstroms estimated by size exclusion chromatography, (ii) consists of tetramers detected by analytical ultracentrifugation, and (iii) appears by electron microscopy studies as tetramers with the tendency to assemble into high molecular mass lattice-like complexes. The structural features suggest that BDV-M possesses a dominant driving force for virus particle formation.

A novel neurotrophic role of secretory phospholipases A2 for cerebellar
granule neurons.

FEBS Lett. 2005 May 9;579(12):2693-701. Epub 2005 Apr 18.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) require membrane depolarization or neurotrophic factors for their survival in vitro and undergo apoptosis when deprived of these survival-promoting stimuli. Here, we show that secretory phospholipases A(2)s (sPLA(2)s) rescue CGNs from apoptosis after potassium deprivation. The neurotrophic effect required the enzymatic activity of sPLA(2)s, since catalytically inactive mutants of sPLA(2)s failed to protect CGNs from apoptosis. Consistently, the ability of sPLA(2)s to protect CGNs from apoptosis correlated with the extent of sPLA(2)-induced arachidonic acid release from live CGNs. The survival-promoting effect of sPLA(2) was inhibited by depletion of extracellular Ca(2+) or by the presence of L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nicardipine, suggesting that Ca(2+) influx occurs upon sPLA(2) treatment. Among the mammalian sPLA(2)s tested, only group X sPLA(2), but not group IB nor IIA sPLA(2)s, displayed neurotrophic activity. These results suggest a novel, unexpected neurotrophin-like role of sPLA(2) in the nervous system.

People with 59-200 CGG.CCG-repeats in the 5' UTR of one of their FMR1 genes are at risk for Fragile X tremor and ataxia syndrome. Females are also at risk for premature ovarian failure. These symptoms are thought to be due to the presence of the repeats at the DNA and/or RNA level. We show here that long transcribed but untranslated CGG-repeat tracts are toxic to human cells and alter the expression of a wide variety of different genes including caspase-8, CYFIP, Neurotensin and UBE3A.

<ABSTRACT>
This is the first report of a systematic study of genes expressed by means of expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis in oil palm, a species of the Arecales order, a phylogenetically key clade of monocotyledons that is not widely represented in the sequence databases. Five different cDNA libraries were generated from male and female inflorescences, shoot apices and zygotic embryos and unidirectional systematic sequencing was performed. A total of 2411 valid EST sequences were thus obtained. Cluster analysis enabled the identification of 209 groups of related sequences and 1874 singletons. Putative functions were assigned to 1252 of the set of 2083 non-redundant ESTs obtained. The EST database described here is a first step towards gene discovery and cDNA array-based expression analysis in oil palm.

<ABSTRACT>
PrP(c) (cellular prion protein) and Doppel are antagonizing proteins, respectively neuroprotective and neurotoxic. Evidence for Doppel neurotoxicity came from PrP(c)-deficient (Prnp(0/0)) mouse lines developing late onset Purkinje-cell degeneration caused by Doppel overexpression in brain. To address the molecular underpinnings of this cell-type specificity, we generated Doppel N-terminal-specific antibodies and started to examine the spatio-temporal expression of Doppel protein species in Ngsk Prnp(0/0) brain. Although Doppel overexpression is ubiquitous, Western analyses of normal and deglycosylated protein extracts revealed cerebellar patterns distinct from the rest of the brain, supporting the idea that neurotoxicity might be linked to a particular Doppel species pattern. Furthermore, our newly raised antibodies allowed the first Doppel immunohistochemical analyses in brain, showing a distribution in Prnp(0/0) cerebellum similar to PrP(c) in wild type.

<ABSTRACT>
4-Methylumbelliferone (MU) inhibits the cell surface hyaluronan (HA) formation, and that such inhibition results in suppression of adhesion and locomotion of cultured melanoma cells. Here, we examine the effect of MU on melanoma cell metastasis in vivo. MU-treated melanoma cells showed both decreased cell surface HA formation and suppression of liver metastasis after injection into the mice. Oral administration of MU to mice decreased tissue HA content. These HA knock-down mice displayed suppressed liver metastasis. Thus, both cell surface HA of melanoma cells and recipient liver HA can promote liver metastasis, indicating that MU has potential as an anti-metastatic agent.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We identified a DMT (divalent metal transporter) homologous protein that functions as a Ca(2+) transporter. Scallop DMT cDNA encodes a 539-amino-acid protein with 12 putative membrane-spanning domains and has a consensus transport motif in the fourth extracellular loop. Since its mRNA is significantly expressed in the gill and intestine, it is assumed that scallop DMT transports Ca(2+) from seawater by the gill and from food by the intestine. Scallop DMT lacks the iron-responsive element commonly found in iron-regulatory proteins, suggesting that it is free of the post-transcriptional regulation from intracellular Fe(2+) concentration. Scallop DMT distinctly functions as a Ca(2+) transporter unlike other DMTs, however, it also transports Fe(2+) and Cd(2+) similar to them.

We provide, for the first time, a systematic study of EPC phenotype and functional features within the first 3 days of culture.

<ABSTRACT>
The Delta(6)-fatty acid desaturase is a key enzyme in the synthesis of an important fatty acid, gamma-linolenic acid. We have characterized, by heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, substrate specificity and preference of Delta(6)-desaturase of Mucor rouxii. Fatty acid supplementation was carried out based on the predicted enzyme topology, fatty acid phenotype and the corresponding metabolic pathway in M. rouxii. The enzyme has a broad substrate specificity as based on C15-C18. The result also supported classification of the M. rouxii Delta(6)-desaturase into a front-end desaturase. Interestingly, a relatively rare activity based on odd acyl chains and not described previously in other eukaryotic Delta(6)-desaturases was also observed.

<ABSTRACT>
In eukaryotic cells, peroxiredoxins are both antioxidants and regulators of H(2)O(2)-mediated signaling. We previously found that peroxiredoxin-I (Prx-I) was overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue. Since overexpressed protein can induce a humoral immune response, we examined whether serum from NSCLC patients exhibited immunoreactivity against Prx-I using Western blotting. We found that 25 (47%) of 53 NSCLC patients tested had autoantibodies against Prx-I in their sera, whereas such activity was detected in 4 (8%) sera from 50 healthy subjects. Prx-I itself was detected in the sera from 18 (34%) of 53 NSCLC patients but in only 1 (2%) serum from 50 controls. Moreover, 17% of NSCLC sera were positive to both Prx-I antibody and antigen but none in control sera. The data indicate both Prx-I autoantibody and circulating antigen are potential biomarkers for use in serological diagnosis of NSCLC. Interestingly enough, we found that Prx-I was secreted by lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) but not by non-cancer lung cells (BEAS 2B) or breast cancer cells (MCF7). This cell culture study suggests the possibility of Prx-I secretion from NSCLC tumor tissues.

<ABSTRACT>
SNAREs (soluble N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) which locate on the specific organelle membrane assure the correct vesicular transport by mediating specific membrane fusions. SNAREs are referred to as R- or Q-SNAREs on the basis of the amino acid sequence similarities and specific conserved residues. All of the Arabidopsis R-SNAREs have a N-terminal domain, called the longin domain (LD). In this study, we investigated the vacuolar targeting mechanism of Arabidopsis R-SNAREs. The vacuolar localized AtVAMP711 was used as the mother protein of GFP-tagged chimeric proteins joined to several domains such as the LD, the SNARE motif (SNM) and the transmembrane domain (TMD) of other organelle-localized R-SNAREs. The results showed that, whereas the TMD is not relevant for the vacuolar targeting, a complete LD is essential for the vacuolar and subcellular targeting.

<ABSTRACT>
Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns5P) is a relatively recently discovered inositol lipid whose metabolism and functions are not yet clearly understood. We have transfected cells with a number of enzymes that are potentially implicated in the synthesis or metabolism of PtdIns5P, or subjected cells to a variety of stimuli, and then measured cellular PtdIns5P levels by a specific mass assay. Stable or transient overexpression of Type IIalpha PtdInsP kinase, or transient overexpression of Type Ialpha or IIbeta PtdInsP kinases caused no significant change in cellular PtdIns5P levels. Similarly, subjecting cells to oxidative stress or EGF stimulation had no significant effect on PtdIns5P, but stimulation of HeLa cells with a phosphoinositide-specific PLC-coupled agonist, histamine, caused a 40% decrease within 1 min. Our data question the degree to which inositide kinases regulate PtdIns5P levels in cells, and we discuss the possibility that a significant part of both the synthesis and removal of this lipid may be regulated by phosphatases and possibly phospholipases.

We selected a hydrostatic pressure of 30 MPa at 25 degrees C because yeast cells were able to grow under these conditions, while cell size and complexity were increased after decompression. Functional characterization of pressure-induced genes suggests that genes involved in protein metabolism and membrane metabolism were induced. The response to 30 MPa was significantly different from that observed under lethal conditions because protein degradation was not activated under 30 MPa pressure. Strongly induced genes those that contribute to membrane metabolism and which are also induced by detergents, oils, and membrane stabilizers.

<ABSTRACT>
It is now well established that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) act as primary sensors of microbial compounds. Details of the molecular mechanisms governing TLR responses are emerging steadily and our understanding of the signaling pathways activated these receptors has improved greatly over the last few years. Differences in adaptor usage, cellular localisation and signaling cascades have been elucidated. In this review we will summarize the current understanding of TLR signaling and its regulation.

Zinc ions selectively inhibit steps associated with binding and release of
NADP(H) during turnover of proton-translocating transhydrogenase.

FEBS Lett. 2005 May 23;579(13):2863-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Transhydrogenase couples the redox reaction between NAD(H) and NADP(H) to proton translocation across a membrane. In membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli and Rhodospirillum rubrum, the transhydrogenase reaction (measured in the direction driving inward proton translocation) was inhibited by Zn(2+) and Cd(2+). However, depending on pH, the metal ions either had no effect on, or stimulated, "cyclic" transhydrogenation. They must, therefore, interfere specifically with steps involving binding/release of NADP(+)/NADPH: the steps thought to be associated with proton translocation. It is suggested that Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) bind in the proton-transfer pathway and block inter-conversion of states responsible for changing NADP(+)/NADPH binding energy.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
alpha-Crystallin is one of the major protein components in mammalian lens fiber cells. It is composed of alphaA and alphaB subunits that have structural homology to the family of mammalian small heat shock proteins. Horwitz firstly characterized native alpha-crystallin as a molecular chaperone in vitro based on its ability to prevent heat-induced aggregation of lens proteins and enzymes. Andley et al. cloned and expressed human alphaA-crystallin in Escherichia coli and confirmed its chaperone activity by suppression of thermal aggregation and singlet oxygen-induced opacification. Although alphaA-crystallin acts as a chaperone protein, there is no report showing on its ability to protect enzymes against thermal inactivation. Here, we present data showing that alphaA-crystallin can prevent thermal inactivation of CpUDG that catalyzes uracil removal from DNAs.

The flavin reductase ActVB from Streptomyces coelicolor: characterization
of the electron transferase activity of the flavoprotein form.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 May 23;579(13):2817-20.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The flavin reductase ActVB is involved in the last step of actinorhodin biosynthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor. Although ActVB can be isolated with some FMN bound, this form was not involved in the flavin reductase activity. By studying the ferric reductase activity of ActVB, we show that its FMN-bound form exhibits a proper enzymatic activity of reduction of iron complexes by NADH. This shows that ActVB active site exhibits a dual property with regard to the FMN. It can use it as a substrate that goes in and off the active site or as a cofactor to provide an electron transferase activity to the polypeptide.

<ABSTRACT>
Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are becoming widely used for sequence-specific gene silencing in mammalian cells, but designing an effective siRNA is still a challenging task. In this study, we developed an algorithm for predicting siRNA functionality by using generalized string kernel (GSK) combined with support vector machine (SVM). With GSK, siRNA sequences were represented as vectors in a multi-dimensional feature space according to the numbers of subsequences in each siRNA, and subsequently classified with SVM into effective or ineffective siRNAs. We applied this algorithm to published siRNAs, and could classify effective and ineffective siRNAs with 90.6%, 86.2% accuracy, respectively.

FEBS Lett. 2005 May 23;579(13):2830-2. Epub 2005 Apr 25.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Previously a mutant of clostridial glutamate dehydrogenase with the catalytic Asp-165 replaced by Asn was shown to regain activity through spontaneous, specific deamidation of this residue. A double mutant D165N/K125A has now been constructed, in which the catalytic Lys is also replaced. This was successfully over-expressed and according to several criteria appears to be correctly folded. The double mutant was incubated for 35 days under conditions where D165N reactivates. LC-MS analysis of tryptic digests of timed samples showed no significant deamidation. This confirms that the reactivation of D165N is a consequence of the catalytic chemistry of the enzyme's active site.

Comparison of protein and peptide prefractionation methods for the shotgun
proteomic analysis of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Jun;5(9):2468-78.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteome analysis by gel-free "shotgun" proteomics relies on the simplification of a peptide mixture before it is analyzed in a mass spectrometer. While separation on a reverse-phase (RP) liquid chromatographic column is widely employed, a variety of other methods have been used to fractionate both proteins and peptides before this step. We compared six different protein and peptide fractionation workflows, using Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a useful model cyanobacterium for potential exploitation to improve its production of hydrogen and other secondary metabolites. Pre-digestion protein separation was performed by strip-based isoelectric focusing, one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or weak anion exchange chromatography, while pre-RP peptide separation was accomplished by isoelectric focusing (IEF) or strong cation exchange chromatography. Peptides were identified using electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectra were analyzed using ProID software employing both a single organism database and the entire NCBI non-redundant database, and a total of 776 proteins were identified using a stringent set of selection criteria. Method comparisons were made on the basis of the results obtained (number and types of proteins identified), as well as ease of use and other practical aspects. IEF-IEF protein and peptide fractionation prior to RP gave the best overall performance.

Panorama Ab Microarray Cell Signaling kit: a unique tool for protein
expression analysis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jun;5(9):2412-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Antibody arrays are a promising new tool for mass analysis of protein level changes in cells responding to different stimuli. Here we describe a novel antibody array system called Panorama Ab Microarray Cell Signaling, that contains 224 antibodies spotted on FAST nitrocellulose-coated slides that can detect protein levels as low as a few nanograms per mL. The antibodies spotted are specific for proteins important in various areas of cell signaling such as phosphorylation, cell cycle, apoptosis, nuclear signaling and cytoskeleton proteins. Furthermore, for some of the protein targes, the Panorama Ab Microarray can detect phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the traget protein. We found that treatment of the slides post-spotting is important for the array performance (ratio of signal to background) and its stability. Panorama Ab Microarray was used to analyze changes in protein expression in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells stimulated to differentiate by all-trans retinoic acid. We found that the level of several proteins, among them cell cycle regulators and kineases, was either up- or down-regulated. For more than ten protein targets, the results obtained by the Panorama Ab Microarray were confirmed by immunoblotting.

Proteomics. 2005 Jun;5(9):2340-50.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Advances in proteomic research allow the identification of several hundred protein components in complex biological specimens. Structural information is typically lost during proteomic investigations. For this reason, the rapid isolation of monoclonal antibodies specific to proteins of interest would allow the study of structurally intact biological specimens, thus providing complementary proteomic information. Here, we describe the design, construction, characterization, and use of a large synthetic human antibody phage display library (ETH-2-Gold) containing three billion individual antibody clones. A large repertoire of antibodies with similar biochemical properties was produced by appending short variable complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) onto three antibody germline segments (DP47, DPK22, and DPL16), which are frequently found in human antibodies. The ETH-2-Gold library exhibits efficient display of antibody fragments on filamentous phage, as assessed by immunoblot. Furthermore, the library is highly functional, since >90% of clones express soluble antibodies in bacteria and since good quality monoclonal antibodies have been isolated against 16 different antigens. The usefulness of the library as a tool for generating monoclonal antibodies for biomedical applications was tested using the C-domain of tenascin-C (a marker of angiogenesis) as antigen and showing that specific antibodies to this target were able to stain vascular structures in tumor sections.

Protein profile changes in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in
response to SEL1L gene induction.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jun;5(9):2433-42.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The ectopic expression of the gene SEL1L in the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 resulted in a reduction of the aggressive behaviour of these cells in vitro. In addition, in vivo analysis on a series of primary breast carcinomas revealed an association between the SEL1L protein levels and the patient's overall survival. We aimed to find those proteins, associated with SEL1L, which may be involved in modulating the aggressive or invasive behaviour of breast cancer cells. For this purpose, we used both the proteomic and microarray approaches. Image analysis of two-dimensional electropherograms revealed the presence of 27 qualitative and 35 quantitative variations between the MCF7-SEL1L expressing cells compared to control. Mass spectrometry identified 32 changing proteins mostly involved in cytoskeletal and metabolic activities, stress response and protein folding, selenoprotein synthesis and cellular proliferation. Five of these also showed changes in transcript levels, as assessed by Affymetrix microarray analysis. Interestingly, seven proteins: carbonic anhydrase (CA) II, ovarian/breast septin, S100A16 calcium binding protein, 14-3-3 protein sigma, proteasome subunit beta type 6, Hsp60 and protein disulphide-isomerase A3 merit particular attention since they are known to be involved in cancer, in response to cellular stress and in protein folding.

<ABSTRACT>
Prior to analysis by mass spectrometry, protein samples are often digested. Maximizing the peptide yield from digestion can increase the number of peptides detected and the confidence in protein identification. To determine the optimal conditions for digestion, the Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters for Promega sequencing grade modified trypsin were measured over a range of temperatures and pHs. The results indicate that an increase in digestion temperature above 37 degrees C, the temperature traditionally used in digestion methods, could offer an increase in peptides detected.

Ultra-high sensitivity multi-photon detection imaging in proteomics

Proteomics. 2005 Jun;5(9):2322-30.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We report on the use of 125I and 131I labeling and of new, multicolor, multi-photon detection (MPD) methods to routinely and quantitatively detect protein spots on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis plates in the zeptomole to attomole range. We demonstrate that the MPD methodology can be used to detect radioactive labels on two-dimensional gels and has several characteristics that are advantageous for functional proteomics. First, by using single particle detectors, the sensitivity for detection of radiolabels can be improved dramatically. Second, because single particle detectors can differentiate the particle energies produced by different decay processes, it is possible to choose combinations of radioisotopes that can be detected and quantified individually on the same 2-D gel. Third, the MPD technology is essentially linear over six to seven orders of magnitude, i.e., it is possible to accurately quantify radiolabeled proteins over a range from at least 60 zeptomoles to 60 femtomoles. Finally for radionuclides that decay by electron capture, e.g., with emission of both beta and gamma rays, co-incident detection of two particles/photons can be used to detect such radionuclides well below background radiation levels. These methods are used to monitor acidic/phosphorylated proteins in as little as 60 ng of HeLa cells proteins.

Spot overlapping in two-dimensional maps: a serious problem ignored for
much too long.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jun;5(9):2385-95.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In the analysis of a neuroblastoma xenograft implanted in mice using two-dimensional maps, some 85 proteins were found to be up- or down-regulated (out of a total of 264 detected by a medium-sensitivity colloidal Coomassie stain). When these spots were eluted and analysed by mass spectrometry in a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer, a number of spots were found to be envelopes of different polypeptide chains. Out of a total of 74 proteins identified, 52 (71%) were found to be singlets, 14 (19%) were doublets, 6 (8%) were triplets, 1 was a quadruplet and 1 a quintuplet. Analysis of the DeltapI and DeltaMr of all species contained in a single gel segment eluted helped point out potential errors in protein identification. This was a unique case, in that very minute bioptic sample loads were applied to the gel. In normal cases, where sample loads of ca. 1 mg of total protein are applied and typically at least 1000 spots are visualised, the singlets will be the minority, rarely exceeding 30% of all spots analysed. The experimental data on the abundance of overlapping spots were in excellent agreement with theoretical data calculated on the basis of the statistical theory of spot overlapping, originally proposed by Davis and further developed by some of the authors. Ways and means for minimizing spot overlap and visualising a greater number of spots in a two-dimensional map are discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
Images obtained from high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS) contain information that remains hidden when looking at a single spectrum at a time. Image processing of liquid chromatography-MS datasets can be extremely useful for quality control, experimental monitoring and knowledge extraction. The importance of imaging in differential analysis of proteomic experiments has already been established through two-dimensional gels and can now be foreseen with MS images. We present MSight, a new software designed to construct and manipulate MS images, as well as to facilitate their analysis and comparison.

<ABSTRACT>
We have previously described our systems for the high-throughput production of antibodies against mouse KIAA proteins and their validation (Proteomics 2004, 4, 1412-1416). Using our "libraries" of antibodies, we established a novel antibody microarray system in which surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology is utilized for signal detection. Up to 400 real-time antibody-target bindings could be measured simultaneously within a single hour. This rapid detection was achieved by direct readout of the bindings using SPR technology. To evaluate our system, we assessed the reproducibility on crude protein samples and obtained satisfactorily reproducible results, exhibiting correlation values >0.92. Using this SPR-based antibody microarray system, we examined mKIAA protein expression in five different adult mouse tissues and identified the specific tissue expression patterns of several mKIAA proteins.

Art-loving bugs: the resurrection of Spinello Aretino from Pisa's
cemetery.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Jun;5(9):2453-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
During 1391-1392, Spinello Aretino painted a cycle of frescoes in Pisa's cemetery on the theme "Storie dei Santi Martiri Efisio e Potito", highly prized by contemporaries and by Vasari. Twenty years ago, one of these frescoes, "Conversione di S. Efisio e Battaglia" (Conversion of S. Efisio and Battle), because of discolouring and bad damage caused by humidity and atmospheric pollution, was removed from the walls using the "tear-off" technique, consisting in covering the surface with a strong cloth bound to the surface with generous layers of formaldehyde-treated glue. As luck would have it, this large fresco (3.50x7.80 m) was abandoned in a storehouse for more than 20 years. When the curators attempted to remove the cloth, much to their dismay they found that the glue resisted any attempt at digestion, even when treated with concoctions of the most aggressive proteolytic enzymes available on the market. It is likely that during the long storage the glue became slowly cross-linked by the formaldehyde to the point of forming an intricate mass of untreatable proteinaceous material. Thus, although poor Spinello died presumably as a bona fide Christian, his painting was condemned to wear the burka, Muslim-fashion, for the rest of its life. When we recently treated the fresco with a suspension of viable Pseudomonas stutzeri cells, these bacteria, although agnostic, were able to fully digest the hardened glue and restore to life Spinello's glorious painting. We show here how proteomics helped us solve the riddle of how these bacteria acted on the burka-obscured fresco.

Gene products with evolutionary functions.

Proteomics. 2005 Jun;5(9):2280-4.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
It is often tacitly assumed that all gene products serve the needs of life functions of the individual carrying the genome. However, a close look at the formation of genetic variations, which are the drivers of biological evolution, reveals a different view. While a majority of the products of genes, such as housekeeping genes and genes essential for each individual, when exposed to particular life conditions respond to the definition given above, other gene products clearly carry out evolutionary functions at the level of populations. Products of these evolution genes act as generators of genetic variations and/or as modulators of the frequency of genetic variation. This is most readily seen with bacterial populations. Many different mechanisms contribute to the occasional, overall formation of genetic variations. These mechanisms can be grouped into three mechanistically and qualitatively different strategies of generating genetic variations. In addition to the activities of evolution genes, specific properties of matter such as tautomery also contribute to the formation of genetic variations. The views that nature cares actively for biological evolution are documented by evidence taken mainly from microbial genetics. Essential elements of the theory of molecular evolution are discussed, as well as the relevance of this theory for higher organisms and its impact on our worldview.

<ABSTRACT>
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were used to determine the multiple acetylation sites in the histone acetyltransferase (HAT): p300-HAT. Partial cleavage of the peptides containing acetylated lysine residues by trypsin provided a set of nested sequences that enabled us to determine that multiple acetylation occurs on the same molecule. At the same time, cleavages resulting in a terminal unacetylated lysine suggested that not all of these sites are fully modified. Using MS and MS/MS, we were able to characterize both the unmodified and acetylated tryptic peptides covering more than 82% of the protein.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Clostridium difficile is a bacterium that causes disease of the large intestine, particularly after treatment with antibiotics. The bacterium produces two toxins (A and B) that are responsible for the pathology of the disease. In addition, a number of bacterial virulence factors associated with adhesion to the gut have previously been identified, including the cell wall protein Cwp66, the high-molecular weight surface layer protein (HMW-SLP) and the flagella. As the genome sequence predicts many other cell wall associated proteins, we have investigated the diversity of proteins in cell wall extracts, with the aim of identifying further virulence factors. We have used a number of methods to remove the proteins associated with the cell wall of C. difficile. Two of the resulting extracts, obtained using low pH glycine treatment and lysozyme digestion of the cell wall, have been analysed in detail by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. One hundred and nineteen spots, comprising 49 different proteins, have been identified. The two surface layer proteins (SLPs) are the most abundant proteins, and we have also found components of the flagellum. Interestingly, we have also determined that a number of paralogs of the HMW-SLP are expressed, and these could represent targets for further investigation as virulence factors.

Characterization of nitroproteome in neuron-like PC12 cells differentiated

alpha-tubulin.

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jun;5(9):2422-32.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Nitric oxide (NO) is a precursor of reactive nitrating species, peroxynitrite and nitrogen dioxide, which modify proteins to generate oxidized species such as 3-nitrotyrosine that has been used as a hallmark of peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative stress on proteins. In the last few years however, a growing body of evidence indicates that NO also regulates a myriad of physiologic responses by modifying tyrosine residues. Looking for the molecular event triggered by NO in nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neuronal differentiation, we recently reported that in differentiating PC12 cells, the cytoskeleton becomes the main cellular fraction containing nitrotyrosinated proteins, and alpha-tubulin is the major target. In the present work, we focus on the investigation of the sites of tyrosine nitration in alpha-tubulin purified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis following anti-alpha-tubulin immunoprecipitation of protein extract from NGF-treated PC12 cells. Using Western blotting and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight analysis, we show for the first time, both in vivo and in vitro, that nitration can occur on alpha-tubulin at sites other than the C-terminus and we positively identify Tyr 161 and Tyr 357 as two specific amino acids endogenously nitrated.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We describe the use of amine-specific isobaric tags for protein expression quantification to study the effect of rhsA element over-expression in Escherichia coli. The use of an isobaric tagging strategy facilitates a shotgun approach to proteomic analysis and enables quantitation of up to four samples in parallel, based on the reporter ion series using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Using a liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization approach, 23,139 MS/MS spectra were collected. Five thousand sixty-three peptides derived from 780 proteins were quantified including several lower abundance proteins, such as transcription factors, DnaB and DnaG. More than 65% of the proteins had at least two high confidence peptide matches per protein (p<0.05). Further, a statistical test based on the Grubb's and Rosner's tests was able to discriminate outlier data. The removal of outlier data had no significant effect on the functional categories of proteins that were represented in the study.

<ABSTRACT>
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) is widely used for initial protein separation in proteomics. Commercial products using neutral pH sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ((SDS-PAGE)/(Bis (2-hydroxyethyl) imino-tris (hydroxymethyl) methane-HCl, or Bis-Tris)) have greatly improved this technique, but cost and limited sizes restrict their applications. An "in-house" system is presented, resulting in better resolution, separation, and new spot visualization and improved resolution when compared to Tris-HCl gels. Their utility is demonstrated using albumin-depleted serum samples, rabbit heart left ventricle, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).

Development of a high-throughput method for preparing human urine for
two-dimensional electrophoresis.

Proteomics. 2005 Jun;5(9):2315-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
There is an increasing interest in analysing the human urinary proteome in the search for biomarkers. However, despite the ease of its collection, urine is a difficult fluid to analyse by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) because of its dilute protein content and high salt levels. Here, we describe a method for high-throughput processing of urine for 2-D PAGE. Urine is filtered and applied to solid phase extraction columns. After washing, the urinary proteins are eluted and freeze dried. The lyophilised powder can then be resuspended in an appropriate buffer for downstream proteomic analysis.

Acrylamide-agarose copolymers: improved resolution of high molecular mass
proteins in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

Proteomics. 2005 Jun;5(9):2331-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A method was developed in order to analyse high molecular mass proteins by two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis using a copolymer of acrylamide and allyl agarose instead of Bis cross-linked polyacrylamide (PA) gels in sodium dodecyl sulphate-electrophoresis. In this work, the matrix composition was optimised to improve the resolution of proteins larger than 200 kDa. The new gel type does not entrap large proteins and protein complexes at the application site. Mechanical properties were investigated through rheological measurements, which suggested the formation of a highly entangled elastomeric soft gel. A high 2-D resolution of proteins, extracted from membranes of red blood cells, was obtained in these gels. An example of tryptic digestion, peptide extraction and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry was reported. The results demonstrate that the new gel is fully compatible with mass spectrometry protein analysis.

Protein microarrays for antibody profiling: specificity and affinity
determination on a chip.

Proteomics. 2005 Jun;5(9):2402-11.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Protein microarray technology facilitates the detection and quantification of hundreds of binding reactions in one reaction from a minute amount of sample. Proof-of-concept studies have shown that the set-up of sensitive assay systems based on protein arrays is possible, however, the lack of specific capture reagents limits their use. Therefore, the generation and characterisation of capture molecules is one of the key topics for the development of protein array based systems. Recombinant antibody technologies, such as HuCAL (human combinatorial antibody library; MorphoSys, Munich, Germany), allow the fast generation of highly specific binders to nearly any given target molecule. Although antibody libraries comprise billions of members, it is not the selection process, but the detailed characterisation of the pre-selected monoclonal antibodies that presents the bottleneck for the production of high numbers of specific binders. In order to obtain detailed information on the properties of such antibodies, a microarray-based method has been developed. We show that it is possible to define the specificity of recombinant Fab fragments by protein and peptide microarrays and that antibodies can be classified by binding patterns. Since the assay uses a miniaturised system for the detection of antibody-antigen interactions, the observed binding occurs under ambient analyte conditions as defined by Ekins (J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 1989, 7, 155-168). This allows the determination of a relative affinity value for each binding event, and a ranking according to affinity is possible. The new microarray based approach has an extraordinary potential to speed up the screening process for the generation of recombinant antibodies with pre-defined selection criteria, since it is intrinsically a high-throughput technology.

<ABSTRACT>
Comparative proteome profiling using stable isotope peptide labelling and mass spectrometry has emerged as a promising strategy. Here, we show the broad potential of our proprietary protein sequence tag (PST) technology. A special feature of PST is its ability to detect a wide variety of proteins including the pharmaceutically relevant membrane and nuclear proteins. This procedure addresses a similar number of proteins, compared to the multidimensional protein identification technology approach, but offers additionally a quantitative analysis with its recently developed quantitative PST version.

Proteasome plasticity.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 13;579(15):3214-23.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The 26S proteasome is responsible for regulated proteolysis of most intracellular proteins yet the focus of intense regulatory action itself. Proteasome abundance is responsive to cell needs or stress conditions, and dynamically localized to concentrations of substrates. Proteasomes are continually assembled and disassembled, and their subunits subject to a variety of posttranslational modifications. Furthermore, as robust and multi-tasking as this complex is, it does not function alone. A spattering of closely associating proteins enhances complex stability, fine-tunes activity, assists in substrate-binding, recycling of ubiquitin, and more. HEAT repeat caps activate proteasomes, yet share remarkable features with nuclear importins. Fascinating cross talk even occurs with ribosomes through common maturation factors. The dynamics of proteasome configurations and how they relate to diverse activities is the topic of this review.

Thermodynamics of phosphorylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine binding to

</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 May 23;579(13):2933-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
PDC-109 binds to sperm plasma membranes by specific interaction with choline phospholipids and induces cholesterol efflux, a necessary event before capacitation - and subsequent fertilization - can occur. The binding of phosphorylcholine (PrC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (Lyso-PC) with PDC-109 was investigated by monitoring the ligand-induced changes in the absorption spectrum of PDC-109. At 20 degrees C, the association constants (K(a)), for PrC and Lyso-PC were obtained as 81.4M(-1) and 2.02 x 10(4) M(-1), respectively, indicating that the binding of Lyso-PC to PDC-109 is 250-fold stronger than that of PrC. From the temperature dependence of the K(a) values, enthalpy of binding (DeltaH(0)) and entropy of binding (DeltaS(0)), were obtained as -79.7 and -237.1 J mol(-1)K(-1) for PrC and -73.0 kJ mol(-1) and -167.3 J mol(-1)K(-1) for Lyso-PC, respectively. These results demonstrate that although the binding of these two ligands is driven by enthalpic forces, smaller negative entropy of binding associated with Lyso-PC results in its significantly stronger binding.

Induction of ornithine decarboxylase in T/C-28a2 chondrocytes by
lysophosphatidic acid: signaling pathway and inhibition of cell
proliferation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 May 23;579(13):2919-25.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Among several extracellular messengers tested, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was able to cause the most marked induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in serum-starved human T/C-28a2 chondrocytes. LPA also induced the activation/phosphorylation of Src, Akt and p44/42 MAPK, and the translocation of PKC-delta from cytosol to membrane coupled to its tyrosine phosphorylation. Experiments with selective signaling inhibitors indicate that LPA leads to Src activation through Gi protein-coupled receptors. In turn Src can activate PI3K and PKC-delta, and all these signaling proteins are required for ODC induction. In conclusion these results show that chondrocytes may be a novel target for LPA action. However, although LPA is considered a mitogen for several cell types and ODC induction is generally correlated to cell growth, LPA was not able to stimulate chondrocyte growth, but rather exerted an anti-proliferative effect.

Abeta(31-35) and Abeta(25-35) fragments of amyloid beta-protein induce

<ABSTRACT>
In order to clarify the basis of neuronal toxicity exerted by the shortest active peptides of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), the toxic effects of Abeta(31-35) and Abeta(25-35) peptides on isolated rat brain mitochondria were investigated. The results show that exposure of isolated rat brain mitochondria to Abeta(31-35) and Abeta(25-35) peptides determines: (i) release of cytochrome c; (ii) mitochondrial swelling and (iii) a significant reduction in mitochondrial oxygen consumption. In contrast, the amplitude of these events resulted attenuated in isolated brain mitochondria exposed to the Abeta(31-35)Met35(OX) in which methionine-35 was oxidized to methionine sulfoxide. The Abeta peptide derivative with norleucine substituting Met-35, i.e., Abeta(31-35)Nle-35, had not effect on any of the biochemical parameters tested. We have further characterized the action of Abeta(31-35) and Abeta(25-35) peptides on neuronal cells. Taken together our result indicate that Abeta(31-35) and Abeta(25-35) peptides in non-aggregated form, i.e., predominantly monomeric, are strongly neurotoxic, having the ability to enter within the cells, determining mitochondrial damage with an evident trigger of apoptotic signals. Such a mechanism of toxicity seems to be dependent by the redox state of methionine-35.

<ABSTRACT>
To examine how gamma- and epsilon-cleavages of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) are related, each cleavage site was replaced with a stretch of Trp that cannot be cleaved by gamma-secretase. Replacement of the gamma- or epsilon-site significantly suppressed secretion of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), and produced longer Abeta or longer APP intracellular domain, respectively. This cleavage at the midportion between gamma- and epsilon-sites was also gamma-secretase-dependent. Blocking this cleavage with a Trp stretch remarkably suppressed Abeta generation, indicating that the midportion cleavage is required for the generation of Abeta.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
ICAM-3 is a DC-SIGN ligand that is constitutively expressed on resting leukocytes, and is thus an important molecule for the first immune response. But, ICAM-3 has not been isolated form rodents. Thus, we compare the ICAM gene clusters in human, dog, mouse, and rat. ICAM-1, -4, -5 and -3 are located close to one another on the same chromosome and show genomic synteny in human and dog. Almost the same ICAM gene clusters were found in rodent genome, but only the ICAM-3 was not present. A phylogenetic tree plotting the cDNAs of human, dog, mouse, rat, and bovine suggested that ICAM-3 was made from a duplication of ICAM-1. Thus, ICAM-3 arose from ICAM-1 in the mammalian evolution, but was lost in the rodent's genome. Our study suggests the different immune response in the rodents in comparison with other mammals.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(10):2488-96.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Blossom-end rot (BER) is a physiopathy that affects tomato fruits causing disorganisation, cell breakage and darkening of the tissues. In this study we describe a tomato fruit protein extraction protocol that includes polyvinyl polypyrrolidone, ascorbic acid and protease inhibitors to promote depletion of phenolics and to avoid protein degradation. The temperature-induced phase separation of plant extracts with nonionic detergent Triton X-114 favours the solubilisation of partially-hydrophobic species in the low-detergent upper phase, making them suitable for further analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The analysis of two-dimensional images revealed differences in number and expression levels of several proteins from the control and BER-affected tomato fruits. Although the appearance of BER in tomato is primarily attributed to a lack of calcium supply to fruits, very little is known about the molecular and biochemical mechanisms involved. The identification of differential proteins from affected fruits with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight and peptide mass fingerprinting analysis revealed the induction of proteins participating in antioxidant processes (ascorbate-glutathione cycle) and the pentose phosphate pathway. We suggest that these two biochemical pathways, acting as reactive oxygen species scavengers in BER-affected fruits, restrain the spread of the blackening to the whole fruit.

Differential protein expression in anatomical zones of the prostate.

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(10):2570-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The prostate has three anatomical zones: the peripheral (PZ), the transition (TZ), and the central (CZ) zone. It is proposed that the CZ may be of mesodermal origin, whereas the other two are of endodermal origin. Proteome patterns in the zones were characterized to test for differences. Cells were scraped from macroscopically normal areas of PZ, TZ, and CZ in radical prostatectomy specimens. After exclusion of samples with cancer or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, 18 cases remained for analysis. Cells were collected in a medium with protease inhibitors, and the protein material was prepared for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The proteins in spots that differed quantitatively between regions were identified via mass spectrometric fingerprinting of tryptic fragments and selected tandem mass spectrometry sequence analysis. Ten proteins with significant zonal differential expression were identified, eight with underexpression in the CZ versus the PZ and the TZ (arginase II, ATP synthase, cytokeratin 8, lamin A/C, peroxiredoxin 4, protein disulfide isomerase A3, tropomyosin, and vimentin), and two with overexpression in the CZ (peroxiredoxin 2 and creatine kinase B). The PZ and TZ, although differing in terms of incidence of cancer and hyperplasia, have epithelium with highly similar major protein expression profiles. However, the protein profile of the CZ differs from that of the other regions, suggesting functional differences.

Mass spectrometry-based analytical tools for the molecular protein
characterization of human plasma lipoproteins.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(10):2619-30.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Lipoproteins are a heterogeneous population of blood plasma particles composed of apolipoproteins and lipids. Lipoproteins transport exogenous and endogenous triglycerides and cholesterol from sites of absorption and formation to sites of storage and usage. Three major classes of lipoproteins are distinguished according to their density: high-density (HDL), low-density (LDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). While HDLs contain mainly apolipoproteins of lower molecular weight, the two other classes contain apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein (a) together with triglycerides and cholesterol. HDL concentrations were found to be inversely related to coronary heart disease and LDL/VLDL concentrations directly related. Although many studies have been published in this area, few have concentrated on the exact protein composition of lipoprotein particles. Lipoproteins were separated by density gradient ultracentrifugation into different subclasses. Native gel electrophoresis revealed different gel migration behaviour of the particles, with less dense particles having higher apparent hydrodynamic radii than denser particles. Apolipoprotein composition profiles were measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry on a macromizer instrument, equipped with the recently introduced cryodetector technology, and revealed differences in apolipoprotein composition between HDL subclasses. By combining these profiles with protein identifications from native and denaturing polyacrylamide gels by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we characterized comprehensively the exact protein composition of different lipoprotein particles. We concluded that the differential display of protein weight information acquired by macromizer mass spectrometry is an excellent tool for revealing structural variations of different lipoprotein particles, and hence the foundation is laid for the screening of cardiovascular disease risk factors associated with lipoproteins.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) representing the most common neoplasia of the kidney in Western countries is a histologic diverse disease with an often unpredictable course. The prognosis of RCC is worsened with the onset of metastasis, and the therapies currently available are of limited success for the treatment of metastatic RCC. Although gene expression analyses and other methods are promising tools clarifying and standardizing the pathological classification of RCC, novel innovative molecular markers for the diagnosis, prognosis, and for the monitoring of this disease during therapy as well as potential therapeutic targets are urgently needed. Using proteome-based strategies, a number of RCC-associated markers either over-expressed or down-regulated in tumor lesions in comparison to the normal epithelium have been identified which have been implicated in tumorigenesis, but never linked to the initiation and/or progression of RCC. These include members of the fatty acid binding protein family, which have the potential to serve as diagnostic or prognostic markers for the screening of RCC patients.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Appropriate methods for the analysis of microdissected solid tumour tissues by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) are not yet well established. Optimisation of sample preparation was performed first on undissected tissue slices, representing approximately 200 000 cells, which were solubilised either in urea containing buffer, trifluoroethanol/NH4HCO3, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) or in 0.1% RapiGest solution, then trypsin digested and analysed by MALDI-TOF MS. Solubilisation in 0.1% SDS resulted in detection of the highest number of sample specific peak signals. Interestingly, there was little overlap in detectable peaks using the different buffers, implying that they can be used complementarily to each other. Additionally, we fractionated tryptic digests on a monolithic high-performance liquid chromatography column. Fractionation of tryptic digest from whole tissue sections resulted in a four-fold increase in the total number of peaks detected. To prove this principle, we used 0.1% SDS to generate peptide patterns from 2000 microdissected tumour and stromal cells from five different breast carcinoma tumours. The tumour and stroma specific peaks could be detected upon comparison of the peptide profiles. Identification of differentially expressed peaks by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS was performed on fractionated tryptic digests derived from a whole tissue slice. In conclusion, we describe a method that is suitable for direct peptide profiling on small amounts of microdissected cells obtained from breast cancer tissues.

murine model of tularemia.

Proteomics. 2005 May;5(8):2090-103.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain infection of mice has been established as an experimental model of tularemia that is suitable for studies of immune mechanisms against the intracellular pathogen. In this study, the model was used to explore immunogenic repertoire of F. tularensis with the aim of identifying new molecules able to activate the host immune system, potential bacterial markers with vaccine, and diagnostic applications. Immunoproteomic approach based on the combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry was applied. Globally, 36 different proteins were identified, which strongly reacted with sera from experimentally infected mice, including several putative virulence markers of intracellular pathogens as nucleoside diphosphate kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, RNA-binding protein Hfq, and molecular chaperone ClpB. Of them, 27 proteins are described for the first time as immunorelevant Francisella proteins. When comparing murine immunoproteome of F. tularensis with our previous data from human patients, 25 of the total of 50 identified murine sera immunoreactive spots were recognized by human sera collected from patients suffering from tularemia, as well. Immune sera from two Lps gene congenic strains of mice, C3H/HeN (Lpsn) and C3H/HeJ (Lpsd), represented murine immunoproteome in this study. The spectrum of immunoreactive spots detected by two-dimensional immunoblotting varied throughout the course of infection depending on murine strain. Nevertheless, the antibody patterns of the two strains showed significant homogeneity in being directed against almost identical subset of antigens.

<ABSTRACT>
We have investigated the acute effects of 17-beta-estradiol (E2) on K+ channels in MCF-7 breast epithelial cancer cells. E2 induced a rapid and irreversible augmentation of the K+ current for all membrane potentials superior to -25 mV. The effect of E2 was sensitive to Iberiotoxin, Charybdotoxin and TEA and can be elicited in the presence of the anti-estrogen ICI 182780 or be mimicked by the membrane impermeant form E2/BSA. Furthermore, E2/BSA was able to stimulate cell proliferation in a maxi-K inhibitors-sensitive manner. Thus, these results permit us to identify the maxi-K channel as the molecular target of E2 that regulates cell proliferation independently of the estrogen receptor.

<ABSTRACT>
CysA, the ATPase subunit of a putative sulfate ATP-binding cassette transport system of the gram-positive thermoacidophilic bacterium Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius, was structurally characterized at a resolution of 2.0 Angstroms in the absence of nucleotides. In line with previous findings on ABC-ATPases the structures of the two monomers (called CysA-1 and CysA-2) in the asymmetric unit differ substantially in the arrangement of their individual (sub)domains. CysA-2 was found as a physiological dimer composed of two crystallographically related monomers that are arranged in an open state. Interestingly, while the regulatory domain of CysA-2 packs against its opposing domain that of CysA-1 undergoes a conformational change and, in the dimer, would interfere with the opposing monomer thereby preventing solute translocation. Whether this conformational state is used for regulatory purposes will be discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
Point mutations in mitochondrial (mt) tRNA genes are associated with a variety of human mitochondrial diseases. We have shown previously that mt tRNA(Leu(UUR)) with a MELAS A3243G mutation and mt tRNA(Lys) with a MERRF A8344G mutation derived from HeLa background cybrid cells are deficient in normal taurine-containing modifications [taum(5)(s(2))U; 5-taurinomethyl-(2-thio)uridine] at the anticodon wobble position in both cases. The wobble modification deficiency results in defective translation. We report here wobble modification deficiencies of mutant mt tRNAs from cybrid cells with different nuclear backgrounds, as well as from patient tissues. These findings demonstrate the generality of the wobble modification deficiency in mutant tRNAs in MELAS and MERRF.

FEBS Lett. 2005 May 23;579(13):2945-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The archaeal parasite Nanoarchaeum equitans was found to generate five tRNA species via a unique process requiring the assembly of seperate 5' and 3' tRNA halves [Randau, L., Munch, R., Hohn, M.J., Jahn, D. and Soll, D. (2005) Nanoarchaeum equitans creates functional tRNAs from separate genes for their 5'- and 3'-halves. Nature 433, 537-541]. Biochemical evidence was missing for one of the computationally-predicted, joined tRNAs designated as tRNA(Trp). Our RT-PCR and sequencing results identify this tRNA as tRNA(Lys) (CUU) joined at the alternative position between bases 30 and 31. We show that the intron-containing tRNA(Trp) was misidentified in the initial Nanoarchaeum equitans genome annotation [E. Waters et al. (2003) The genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans: insights into early archaeal evolution and derived parasitism. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100, 12984-12988]. Along with a previously unidentified joined tRNA(Gln) (UUG), Nanoarchaeum equitans exhibits 44 tRNAs and is enabled to read all 61 sense codons. Features unique to this set of tRNA molecules are discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
Binding of blockers to the human voltage-gated hERG potassium channel is studied using a combination of homology modelling, automated docking calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, where binding affinities are evaluated using the linear interaction energy method. A homology model was constructed based on the available crystal structure of the bacterial KvAP channel and the affinities of a series of sertindole analogues predicted using this model. The calculations reproduce the relative binding affinities of these compounds very well and indicate that both polar interactions near the intracellular opening of the selectivity filter as well as hydrophobic complementarity in the region around F656 are important for blocker binding. These results are consistent with recent alanine scanning mutation experiments on the blocking of the hERG channel by other compounds.

Identification of B cell adaptor for PI3-kinase (BCAP) as an Abl
interactor 1-regulated substrate of Abl kinases.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):2986-90.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In previous work we showed that Abl interactor 1 (Abi-1), by linking enzyme and substrate, promotes the phosphorylation of Mammalian Enabled (Mena) by c-Abl. To determine whether this mechanism extends to other c-Abl substrates, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to search for proteins that interact with Abi-1. By screening a human leukocyte cDNA library, we identified BCAP (B-cell adaptor for phosphoinositide 3-kinase) as another Abi-1-interacting protein. Binding experiments revealed that the SH3 domain of Abi-1 and the C-terminal polyproline structure of BCAP are involved in interactions between the two. In cultured cells, Abi-1 promoted phosphorylation of BCAP not only by c-Abl but also by v-Abl. The phosphorylation sites of BCAP by c-Abl were mapped to five tyrosine residues in the C-terminal region that are well conserved in mammals. These results show that Abi-1 promotes Abl-mediated BCAP phosphorylation and suggest that Abi-1 in general coordinates kinase-substrate interactions.

Analysis of telomeric single-strand overhang length in human endometrial
cancers.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 May 23;579(13):2959-64.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The 3' single-strand telomeric overhang (3'-OH) is a key component of telomere structure. Although telomere length has been well analyzed in a variety of human cancers, no information is available on the 3'-OH length in cancers. In the present study, we examined the 3'-OH length in normal and malignant endometria using telomere-oligonucleotide ligation assay. Although 3'-OH lengths varied among patients, 3'-OH length observed in endometrial cancers was significantly shorter than that found in samples derived from normal endometria (P < 0.001: Student's t-test), suggesting that erosion of 3'-OH length induces impaired telomeric integrity and genomic instability, leading to carcinogenesis. Interestingly, we found that the most aggressive subtypes of endometrial cancers harbored significantly longer 3'-OH length than those with non-aggressive subtypes (P < 0.001: Sheffe's test), suggesting that cancer cells with long 3'-OH length have growth advantage due to their stabilized telomere ends. In contrast, we failed to observe an association between overall telomere length and any clinicopathological characteristics of endometrial cancers. These findings suggest that erosion of 3'-OH length, rather than overall telomere length, play roles in endometrial carcinogenesis. Furthermore, long 3'-OH may serve as a molecular marker for aggressive phenotype of tumors.

D-threo-tetrahydrobiopterin is synthesized via

Ax2.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3085-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The biosynthesis of D-threo-tetrahydrobiopterin (DH4, tetrahydrodictyopterin) in Dictyostelium discoideum Ax2 was investigated through the mutant disrupted in the gene encoding sepiapterin reductase (SR) by insertional inactivation. The mutant cells, being completely devoid of SR protein, showed 18.1% of L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and 0.6% of DH4 productions in the wild type cells. The mutant cells were also identified to excrete D- and L-sepiapterin, which were presumed to originate from intracellular 1'-oxo-2'-D-hydroxypropyl- and 1'-oxo-2'-L-hydroxypropyl-tetrahydropterin (H4-pterin), respectively. Furthermore, in a coupled assay with Dictyostelium SR, the mutant cell extract exhibited a novel enzyme activity converting 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin to 1'-oxo-2'-D-hydroxypropyl-H4-pterin. These results are clear demonstration of the in vivo synthesis of DH4 via 1'-oxo-2'-D-hydroxypropyl-H4-pterin as well as an alternative synthesis of BH4 and DH4 in the complete absence of SR.

Phosphorylation of a tyrosine at the N-terminus regulates the surface

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3019-23.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying GIRK5 and Delta5GIRK5 splicing variants do not express functional potassium channels. In contrast, Delta25GIRK5 forms functional homomultimers in Xenopus laevis oocytes. A tyrosine is present at the N-term of the non-functional isoforms. We studied the effect of endogenous tyrosine phosphorylation on the GIRK5 surface and functional expression. Unlike wild type channels, GIRK5Y16A and Delta5GIRK5Y16A mutants displayed inwardly rectifying currents and inhibitors of Src tyrosine kinase promoted the traffiking of GIRK5 to the cell surface. This is the first evidence that endogenous phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in a GIRK channel inhibits its surface expression.

Heterogeneities in EGF receptor density at the cell surface can lead to
concave up scatchard plot of EGF binding.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3043-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The mechanism responsible for the concave up nature of the Scatchard plot of epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding on EGF receptor (EGFR) has been a controversial issue for more than a decade. Past efforts to mechanistically simulate the concave up nature of the Scatchard plot of EGF binding have shown that negative cooperativity in EGF binding on an EGFR dimer or inclusion of some external site or binding event can describe this behavior. However, herein we show that heterogeneity in the density of EGFR due to localization in certain regions of the plasma membrane, which has been experimentally reported, can also lead to concave up shape of the Scatchard plot of the EGF binding on EGFR.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
GD3 is an intracellular mediator of apoptotic signaling. Although GD3 is known to directly act on mitochondria, the dynamic responses of individual mitochondria to GD3 remain to be elucidated. In the current study, the membrane potential of single mitochondria is observed in the presence of GD3 or its analogues. Here, we report that (1) GD3 specifically induces gradual depolarizations of the inner membrane by a mechanism that differs from the permeability transition, and (2) the GD3-induced depolarizations are suppressed by cyclosporin A. These results suggest that GD3 depolarizes mitochondria by a mechanism distinct from but relevant to the permeability transition.

Knock-down of LAR protein tyrosine phosphatase induces insulin resistance.

<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3024-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
To test the role of the leukocyte common antigen-related protein tyrosine phosphatase (LAR) as a regulator of insulin receptor (IR) signalling, an siRNA probe against LAR was developed. Knock-down of LAR induced post-receptor insulin resistance with the insulin-induced activation of PKB/Akt and MAP kinases markedly inhibited. The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the IR and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins were unaffected by LAR knock-down. These results identify LAR as a crucial regulator of the sensitivity of two key insulin signalling pathways to insulin. Moreover, the siRNA probe provides a molecular tool of general applicability for further dissecting the precise targets and roles of LAR.

<ABSTRACT>
We have developed a computer program able to make user-customised databases derived from the public PIR non-redundant reference protein database. When the database of interest has been created, the user will generate the map of all the possible linear peptides containing one and two cysteines for each protein and combine them to calculate the mass of all the possible clusters of linear peptides linked by a disulphide bridge with a cysteine pair. It is also possible to create selected maps corresponding to peptides formed by the action of specific proteases. In this way, mass spectrometric data obtained from the hydrolysis of proteins of unknown sequence can be related to that contained in the database for quick disulphide assignment and protein identification. To confirm signal attribution, the program will also furnish the expected mass of cluster peptides after performing a cycle of Edman degradation. The utility of the program is discussed and examples of application are given.

Ammonia and methanol both bind to the water oxidising complex of photosystem II during its turnover, possibly at sites where water binds during the normal water oxidation process. We have investigated the interaction between these two water analogues at the S2 state of the water oxidising cycle using electron magnetic resonance techniques. We find evidence that ammonia displaces methanol from its binding site.

Role of Nrf2 signaling in regulation of antioxidants and phase 2 enzymes

species-induced cell injury.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3029-36.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Understanding the molecular pathway(s) of antioxidant gene regulation is of crucial importance for developing antioxidant-inducing agents for the intervention of oxidative cardiac disorders. Accordingly, this study was undertaken to determine the role of Nrf2 signaling in the basal expression as well as the chemical inducibility of endogenous antioxidants and phase 2 enzymes in cardiac fibroblasts. The basal expression of a scope of key cellular antioxidants and phase 2 enzymes was significantly lower in cardiac fibroblasts derived from Nrf2-/- mice than those from wild type control. These include catalase, reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), GSH S-transferase (GST), and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1). Incubation of Nrf2+/+ cardiac fibroblasts with 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) led to a significant induction of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, GSH, GR, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), GST, and NQO1. The inducibility of SOD, catalase, GSH, GR, GST, and NQO1, but not GPx by D3T was completely abolished in Nrf2-/- cells. The Nrf2-/- cardiac fibroblasts were much more sensitive to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species-mediated cytotoxicity. Upregulation of antioxidants and phase 2 enzymes by D3T in Nrf2+/+ cardiac fibroblasts resulted in a dramatically increased resistance to the above species-induced cytotoxicity. In contrast, D3T-treatment of the Nrf2-/- cells only provided a slight cytoprotection. Taken together, this study demonstrates for the first time that Nrf2 is critically involved in the regulation of the basal expression and chemical induction of a number of antioxidants and phase 2 enzymes in cardiac fibroblasts, and is an important factor in controlling cardiac cellular susceptibility to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species-induced cytotoxicity.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Here, we report the volume and enthalpy changes accompanying CO photodissociation from the mixed valence form of cytochrome bo3 oxidase from Escherichia coli. The results of photoacoustic calorimetry indicate two kinetic phases with distinct volume and enthalpy changes accompanying CO photodissociation from heme o3 and its transfer to CuB. The first phase occurring on a timescale of <50 ns is characterized by a volume decrease of -1.3+/-0.3 mL mol-1 and enthalpy change of 32+/-1.6 kcal mol-1. Subsequently, a volume increase of 2.9 mL mol-1 with an enthalpy change of -5.3+/-2.5 kcal mol-1 is observed with the lifetime of approximately 250 ns (this phase has not been detected in previous optical studies). These volume and enthalpy changes differ from the volume and enthalpy changes observed for CO dissociation from fully reduced cytochrome bo3 oxidase indicating that the heme o3/CuB active site dynamics are affected by the redox state of heme b.

<ABSTRACT>
The p53 protein interaction network is crucial in regulating the metazoan cell cycle and apoptosis. Here, the robustness of the p53 network is studied by analyzing its degeneration under two modes of attack. Linear Programming is used to calculate average path lengths among proteins and the network diameter as measures of functionality. The p53 network is found to be robust to random loss of nodes, but vulnerable to a targeted attack against its hubs, as a result of its architecture. The significance of the results is considered with respect to mutational knockouts of proteins and the directed attacks mounted by tumour inducing viruses.

<ABSTRACT>
The V-ATPases are ubiquitous enzymes of eukaryotes. They are involved in many cellular processes via their ability to pump protons across biological membranes. They are two domain enzymes comprising an ATP hydrolysing sector and a proton translocating sector. Both sectors are functionally coupled. The proton tanslocating sector, V0, is comprised of five polypeptides in an as yet undetermined stoichiometry. In V0 three homologous proteins, subunit c, c' and c'' have previously been reported to be essential for assembly of the enzyme. However, we report that subunit c'' is not essential for assembly but is for functional coupling of the enzyme.

Phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-128 during mitosis and paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis.

<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3090-4.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Phosphorylation of BCL-2 family member BAD at different residues triggers different physiological effects, either inhibiting or promoting apoptosis. The recently identified phosphorylation site at Ser-128 enhances the apoptotic activity of BAD. We here show that BAD becomes phosphorylated at Ser-128 in the mitotic phase of the cell cycle in NIH3T3 cells. We also show that BAD-S128 is phosphorylated in taxol-treated mouse fibroblasts and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. However, expression of a phosphorylation-defective dominant negative BAD mutant did not block taxol-induced apoptosis. These data support the view that the phosphorylation of BAD Serine 128 exerts cell-specific effects on apoptosis. Whereas the BAD Serine 128 phosphorylation induces apoptosis in neuronal cells, it does not appear to promote apoptosis in proliferating non-neural cells during mitosis or upon exposure to the antineoplastic agent taxol.

<ABSTRACT>
Markers of oxidative stress in peripheral blood from patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) were analyzed. Thirty-three AD patients were recruited. Plasma antioxidant power (AOP), plasma Cystatin C as well as Cathepsin D in PBL were evaluated. We found that the AOP levels were significantly decreased in AD patients if compared to healthy donors, while the plasma level of Cystatin C was significantly higher. Importantly, a significantly decreased expression of Cathepsin D in PBL was also observed. These results suggest that oxidative imbalance in the peripheral blood of AD patients could mirror oxidative changes previously described in the central nervous system.

<ABSTRACT>
To understand the decoding property of nematode mitochondrial tRNAs with unusual secondary structures, post-transcriptional modifications at wobble positions of Ascaris suum mitochondrial tRNAs corresponding to two-codon families ending with a purine were analyzed. 5-Carboxymethylaminomethyluridine (cmnm(5)U) was identified at the wobble positions of tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Glu) and tRNA(Gln), while 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (cmnm(5)s(2)U) was present in tRNA(UAA)(Leu)andtRNA(Trp). In most bacterial and mitochondrial tRNAs, the 2-thiouridine derivative is present in tRNAs for Lys, Glu and Gln. These is no report that cmnm(5)s(2)U is used in tRNA(UAA)(Leu)andtRNA(Trp). The unusual usage of wobble modifications might assist decoding of nematode mitochondrial mRNAs.

<ABSTRACT>
The present study provides the first evidence that the abundance of catalytic alpha1-subunit of Na,K-ATPase increases in the course of T cell blast transformation. Immunodepressant cyclosporin A at anti-proliferative doses diminished the induction of alpha1 protein in activated lymphocytes. Furthermore, in competent T cells, IL-2 increases both the transport activity of Na/K pump and the content of Na,K-ATPase alpha1 protein in a time-dependent manner. A correlation was found between the long-term elevation in ouabain-sensitive Rb influxes and the increase in alpha1 protein content in late activated T cells. These results suggest that (1) the increased expression of Na,K-ATPase proteins underlie the cell cycle-dependent upregulation of ion pump during T cell transformation, and (2) IL-2 is involved in the regulated expression of Na,K-ATPase in human lymphocytes.

<ABSTRACT>
An immunoproteasome subunit low molecular weight protein 7 (LMP7) plays critical roles in major histocompatibility complex class I antigen processing; however, the mechanism for its expression has remained unclear. We demonstrate that interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) has a pivotal role in IFN-gamma-dependent LMP7 expression, as was shown for the other two immunosubunits. A tetracycline-inducible system for IRF-1 revealed its function in the LMP7 expression, and a genomic region functionally interacting with IRF-1 was also determined. Furthermore, the role of IRF-1 in IFN-gamma-inducible LMP7 transcription was confirmed by employing small interfering RNA experiments and IRF-1-/- mice. These results suggest that IRF-1 acts as a master regulator for the concerted expression of immunoproteasome components.

<ABSTRACT>
SH3 domain binding glutamic acid-rich protein like 3 (SH3BGRL3) is the new member of thioredoxin (TRX) super family, whose posttranslational modified form was identified as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitory protein, TIP-B1. In this paper, we determined its solution structure by multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The overall structure of human SH3BGRL3 conformed to a TRX-like fold. To understand its function in vivo, the upregulated expression in acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4 at both mRNA and protein level was elucidated. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry staining with monoclonal antibody against SH3BGRL3 demonstrated that it was a cytoplasmic protein in both NB4 cell and human tissues. These results, as a whole, indicate that SH3BGRL3 may function as a regulator in all-trans retinoic acid-induced pathway.

FEBS Lett. 2005 May 23;579(13):2795-801. Epub 2005 Apr 21.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Until now, it is known that hypoxia increases the glycolytic enzyme expression at the transcriptional level. Here, we show evidence that hypoxia increases hepatic glucose output and HIF-1 and ATF-2-mediated transactivation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), which plays a critical role as a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, gene in liver. HIF-1 directly bound to the specific PEPCK promoter region through its cognate binding element and found as an active complex with coactivator CBP. Additionally, ATF-2 was also involved to regulate hypoxia-dependent PEPCK transcription in the transcriptional complex with HIF-1 and CBP. Interestingly, retinoic acid (RA) signaling induced the recruitment of HIF-1 on the PEPCK promoter, resulting from the functional interaction of HIF-1 and ATF-2 with coactivator CBP. Taken together, these results suggest that hypoxia signaling leads the hepatic glucose production and release via the increased gene expression of gluconeogenic enzymes, possibly playing a role in providing glucose to other tissues, such as endothelial, brain and muscle cells.

The biochemical properties of UGT72E1 are characterised, and are compared with that of UGT72E2, which is capable of glycosylating the aldehydes as well as coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols.

<ABSTRACT>
Post-transcriptionally modified nucleosides are constituents of transfer RNA (tRNA) that are known to influence tertiary structure, stability and coding properties. Modifications in unfractionated tRNA from the phylogenetically unique archaeal methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri (optimal growth temperature 98 degrees C) were studied using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to establish the extent to which they might differ from those of other methanogens. The exceptionally diverse population of nucleosides included four new nucleosides of unknown structure, and one that was characterized as N(6)-acetyladenosine, a new RNA constituent. The nucleoside modification pattern in M. kandleri tRNA is notably different from that of other archaeal methanogens, and is closer to that of the thermophilic crenarchaeota.

In spite of its many known functions, little is known about MEF transcriptional regulation. Here, we cloned the 5'-flanking region of human MEF gene and identified a TATA-less promoter region at -204/-54 which contains 4 putative binding sites for Sp1, two of which are essential in up-regulating MEF activity. These were proven by EMSA and blocking Sp1 using RNAi or mithramycin A treatment of HEK293 cells. Our results suggest that Sp1 constitutively regulates the MEF gene.

<ABSTRACT>
The Ras-related human GTPase Rab4a is involved in the regulation of endocytosis through the sorting and recycling of early endosomes. Towards further insight, we have determined the three-dimensional crystal structure of human Rab4a in its GppNHp-bound state to 1.6 Angstroms resolution and in its GDP-bound state to 1.8 Angstroms resolution, respectively. Despite the similarity of the overall structure with other Rab proteins, Rab4a displays significant differences. The structures are discussed with respect to the recently determined structure of human Rab5a and its complex with the Rab5-binding domain of the bivalent effector Rabaptin-5. The Rab4 specific residue His39 modulates the nucleotide binding pocket giving rise to a reduced rate for nucleotide hydrolysis and exchange. In comparison to Rab5, Rab4a has a different GDP-bound conformation within switch 1 region and displays shifts in position and orientation of the hydrophobic triad. The observed differences at the S2-L3-S3 region represent a new example of structural plasticity among Rab proteins and may provide a structural basis to understand the differential binding of similar effector proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Induction of apoptosis in a lymphoma cell line using immune cell-conditioned medium, etoposide or an nitric oxide (NO) donor, resulted in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Agents that inhibited NO production or scavenged ROS or species formed by reaction of NO with ROS, protected the cells from apoptosis. These data support the suggestion that immune rejection of an immunogenic derivative of this lymphoma in vivo involves the induced synthesis of both NO and ROS by the tumour cells.

Roles for lysine residues of the MH2 domain of Smad3 in transforming
growth factor-beta signaling.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Sma and MAD-related protein 3 (Smad3) plays a key role in the intracellular signaling of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of growth factors, which exhibits a diverse set of cellular responses, including cell proliferation and differentiation. Smad3 has the N-terminal Mad homology (MH) 1 and the C-terminal MH2 domains. MH2 domain is essential for the TGF-beta-induced transcriptional activation, because the MH2 domain of Smad3 is involved in the interactions with several transcriptional cofactors as well as the type I TGF-beta receptor (TbetaR-I). In this study, we examined the roles for four lysine residues (Lys-333, Lys-341, Lys-378, and Lys-409) in the Smad3 MH2 domain. Mutation of the lysine (K)-378 to arginine (R) (K378R) abolished the interaction with TbetaR-I, phosphorylation, transcriptional activation by an active TbetaR-I. The K341R mutant also failed to stimulate TGF-beta-induced transcription by resting in the cytoplasm. However, the K409R mutant showed a higher transcriptional activity by stronger interactions with co-activators, such as p300/CBP. Furthermore, both the K341R and K378R mutants act as dominant-negative inhibitors in the TGF-beta-induced target genes of endogenous TGF-beta signal. Thus, the lysine residues of Smad3 MH2 domain play important roles in the transcriptional regulation of TGF-beta signals through TbetaR-I.

Signaling pathways involved in tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3069-74.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have previously demonstrated that the taurine uptake and transporter (TAUT) mRNA expression were upregulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in Caco-2 cells. In this present study, the signaling molecules related to this upregulation were investigated. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitor, repressed the upregulation of taurine uptake and TAUT mRNA expression. A reporter assay revealed that TNF-alpha-induced TAUT transcriptional activity through the NF-kappaB consensus-like sequence in the human TAUT promoter region. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that NF-kappaB could bind to the NF-kappaB consensus-like sequence. The anti-TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) antibody, but not the TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) antibody, repressed this upregulation.

<ABSTRACT>
The conformational transition of a plasmid DNA, pGEG.GL3 (12.5 kbp, circular), induced by spermine(4+) was studied through the observation of individual DNA by fluorescence microscopy. We deduced the change in the hydrodynamic radius R(H) from an analysis of the Brownian motion of single DNA molecules. R(H) decreases in a continuous manner with an increase in spermine(4+), in contrast to the large discrete on/off change for long linear DNA. Just after the transition to the collapsed state, a small number of DNA molecules tend to form an assembly, which disperses in the bulk solution without precipitation.

Catalytic residues and substrate specificity of scytalidoglutamic

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Scytalidoglutamic peptidase (SGP) is the first-discovered member of the eqolisin family of peptidases with a unique structure and a presumed novel catalytic dyad (E136 and Q53) [Fujinaga et al., PNAS 101 (2004) 3364-3369]. Mutants of SGP, E136A, Q53A, and Q53E lost both the autoprocessing and enzymatic activities of the wild-type enzyme. Coupled with the results from the structural analysis of SGP, Glu136 and Gln53 were identified as the catalytic residues. The substrate specificity of SGP is unique, particularly, in the preference at the P3 (basic amino acid), P1' (small a.a.), and P3' (basic a.a.) positions. Superior substrates and inhibitors have been synthesized for kinetic studies based on the results reported here. kcat, Km, and kcat/Km of SGP for D-Dap(MeNHBz)-GFKFF*ALRK(Dnp)-D-R-D-R were 34.8 s-1, 0.065 microM, and 535 microM-1 s-1, respectively. Ki of Ac-FKF-(3S,4S)-phenylstatinyl-LR-NH2 for SGP was 1.2x10(-10) M. Taken together, we can conclude that SGP has not only structural and catalytic novelties but also a unique subsite structure.

Compensatory regulation among ER chaperones in C. elegans.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3063-8.

<ABSTRACT>
We have identified a particularly clear case of compensatory transcriptional regulation among ER chaperones in Caenorhabditis elegans using a GFP reporter transgene that is under the control of the promoter of hsp-4, a C. elegans homolog of GRP-78/BiP. Knockdown by RNA interference of 9 known or predicted ER chaperones induced hsp-4 upregulation via the ire-1/xbp-1 signaling cascade employed in the unfolded protein response. We show that this compensatory regulation is specific for ER chaperones, not dependent on RNA interference, and required for maintaining viability in worms containing a deletion of the hsp-3 gene.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3075-80.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Four sites of the non-homologous region (coding amino acid residues of 347, 421, 466 and 533) of a gene were randomly selected for splitting to investigate the function of beta-glucosidase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens in the co-refolding of peptides into the catalytically active enzyme. As a result of gene splitting, four N- and C-terminal domain peptides were obtained as insoluble inclusion bodies. No catalytic activity was observed when these fragments refolded individually. However, a considerable amount of activity was restored when the two fragments derived from N- and C- terminal peptides were co-refolded together. The deletion of amino acid residues in the non-homologous region resulted in a complete loss of enzyme activity, which suggests that truncation of amino acids in this region strongly affects the co-refolding ability of the enzyme to maintain activity.

Mechanisms for HIV Tat upregulation of IL-10 and other cytokine

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3055-62.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
HIV Tat has been known to have multiple regulatory roles including replication of HIV and modulation of cellular kinases. We investigated whether signaling kinase PKR plays a critical role in mediating Tat-induced cytokine dysregulation. We showed Tat induction of IL-10 dysregulation is associated with PKR activation. To examine the mechanism involved, inhibition of PKR activity abrogated the Tat-induced cytokine induction. We next identified that the MAP kinases including ERK-1/2 and p38 are downstream of PKR in these Tat-induced pathways. Thus, PKR may play a critical role in mediating the subversive effects of HIV Tat resulting in IL-10 induction.

Differential proteome analysis of conditioned media to detect Smad4
regulated secreted biomarkers in colon cancer.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(10):2587-601.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Smad4 is a tumor suppressor gene primarily involved in carcinogenesis of the pancreas and colon. The functional inactivation of Smad4 is a late step genetically. In pancreatic carcinogenesis, loss of Smad4 marks the transition to invasive growth. In colorectal cancers, the frequency of Smad4 inactivation is markedly increased in metastatic cancers. We have established cell biological models, re-expressing Smad4 in deficient human cancer cells, in which we could show that Smad4 is adequate to suppress tumor growth through suppression of angiogenic and invasive properties. Thus, pairs of Smad4-re-expressing and Smad4-deficient cells are prone to model the progression from premalignant stages to carcinomas in the carcinogenic process and may provide access to Smad4 targets of high clinical relevance. We present here a "differential secretome analysis", comparing all the proteins released in vitro from the Smad4-deficient and Smad4-re-expressing SW480 human colon carcinoma cells. The differential secretome catalog comprises more than 25 proteins including proteases and protease inhibitors, as well as established tumor biomarkers. In conclusion, this approach proved to be a sensitive tool to specifically detect Smad4 targets relevant for tumor-stroma interactions. It is also able to reflect complex alterations of cellular physiology. Moreover, the results support our hypothesis that human tumor markers detectable in serum may be identified through differential secretome analyses.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Craniofacial disorders are associated with one-third of human birth defects but the underlying molecular and cellular causes remain poorly understood. Proteomics seems well-placed to benefit this medically important area but the scarcity of embryonic tissues poses a major challenge. In this study, we applied a microsample proteomics strategy to investigate the first branchial arch, an embryonic structure crucial for facial development, and found that proteome analysis is both practicable and informative despite the scarcity of tissue. Exploiting the embryonic chick as a tractable source of accurately staged tissue, we developed a sequential extraction procedure to interface with one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1-D PAGE) and 2-D PAGE. In 2-D gels, about 8% of the visible proteome changed between embryonic days 3 and 5, and the identities determined for 21 proteins accorded with the rapid growth during this period. These results led to the first molecular identification of chicken alpha-fetoprotein, and an unusual localisation of vimentin to endoderm. With over 470 protein spots accessible, this comparative proteomics approach has good prospects for providing new markers, functional hypotheses and genes to target in functional tests. A broader value of extending these approaches to facial development in other species and to other areas in embryology can be anticipated.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
During the peri-implantation period, molecular signaling between embryo and endometrium (layer of tissue lining the uterus lumen) is supposed to be crucial for the maintenance of pregnancy. To investigate embryo-induced alterations in the proteome of bovine endometrium in the preattachment period (day 18), we used monozygotic cattle twins (generated by embryo splitting) as a model eliminating genetic variability as a source for proteome differences. One of the twins was pregnant after the transfer of two in vitro produced blastocysts, while the corresponding twin received a sham-transfer and served as a nonpregnant control. The two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) analysis of the endometrium samples of three twin pairs (pregnant/nonpregnant) revealed four proteins with significantly higher abundance (p < 10(-9)) in each sample derived from the pregnant animals: Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor beta; 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20 alpha-HSD); soluble NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase 1; and acyl-CoA-binding protein. To verify the accuracy of the 2-D DIGE quantification, the abundances of 20 alpha-HSD were quantified by a targeted cleavable isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) approach. The mass spectrometry-based ICAT quantification matched perfectly the results obtained by 2-D DIGE quantification, demonstrating the accuracy of our data. These results demonstrate that our model (monozygotic twins) in combination with the appropriate analytical tools is particularly suitable for the detection of the proteins involved in the embryo-maternal interactions.

<ABSTRACT>
A general strategy for the structural evaluation of N-glycosylation, a common post-translational protein modification, is presented. The methods for the release of N-linked glycans from the gel-separated proteins, their isolation, purification and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analysis of their mixtures were optimised. Since many glycoproteins are available only at low quantities from sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or two-dimensional gels, high attention was paid to obtain N-glycan mixtures representing their actual composition in human plasma by in-gel deglycosylation. The relative sensitivity of solid MALDI matrices for MS analysis of acidic N-glycans was compared. The most favourable results for native acidic N-glycans were obtained with 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone monohydrate/diammoniumcitrate as a matrix. This matrix provided good results for both neutral and acidic mixtures as well as for methylated N-glycans. In the second part of this paper the potential of such an optimised MS strategy alone or in combination with high pH anion-exchange chromatography profiling for the clinical diagnosis of congenital disorders of glycosylation is presented.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy is an important problem in congenital heart disease. We determined the alterations in phenotype that occur in the initial phase of RV hypertrophy and their possible correlations with the degree of hypertrophy. Therefore, we performed a differential proteomic profiling study on RV hypertrophy using an animal model of pulmonary artery banding (PAB) in parallel with hemodynamic characterization. The RV homogenates were subfractionated in myofilament and cytoplasmic proteins, which subsequently were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), excised, and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). The cytoplasmic fraction showed expression changes in metabolic proteins, indicative of a shift from fatty acid to glucose as a substrate for energy supply. Up-regulation of three HSP-27s (1.9-, 1.7-, and 3.5-fold) indicated an altered stress response in RV hypertrophy. Detailed analysis by immunoblotting and MS showed that two of these HSP-27s were at least phosphorylated on Ser15. The myofilament fraction showed up-regulation of desmin and alpha-B-crystallin (1.4-and 1.3-fold, respectively). This alteration in desmin was confirmed by 1-DE immunoblots. Certain differentially expressed proteins, such as HSP-27, showed a significant correlation with the RV weight to the body weight ratio in the PAB rats, suggesting an association with the degree of hypertrophy.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(10):2497-507.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
This study focuses on the specific problems of protein extraction from recalcitrant plant tissues and evaluates several methods to bypass them. Sample preparation is a critical step in a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis proteome approach and is absolutely essential for good results. We evaluated four methods: the classical trichloroacetic acid (TCA)/acetone precipitation, TCA/acetone precipitation and fractionation, an alternative based on fractionation and without precipitation, and phenol extraction methanol/ammonium acetate precipitation. We optimized the phenol extraction protocol for small amounts of tissue, which is essential when the study material is limited. The protocol was optimized for banana (Musa spp.) and was subsequently applied to two other plant species: apple (Malus domestica L.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Banana (Musa spp.) is a good representative of a "difficult" plant species since it contains many interfering metabolites. Only classical TCA/acetone precipitation and phenol extraction methods proved useful as standard methods. Both methods are associated with a minor but reproducible loss of proteins. Every extraction method and the subsequent analytical procedure have their physicochemical limitations; both methods should be investigated before selecting an appropriate protocol. The study, which is presented in this paper, is useful for guiding the experimental setup of many other nonmodel species, containing various interfering elements.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Two-dimensional liquid chromatography separation (2-DL), based on chromatofocusing for first dimension and hydrophobicity for second, can be used as a complementary method to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). A platform now available, ProteomeLab PF 2D provided by Beckman Coulter, (Fullerton, CA, USA), assembles these methods in automation. This system was applied to resolve large numbers of urine proteins. Reproducibility and sensitivity in protein resolution were evaluated in this study using urines collected from male blood donors. About 1000 peaks were detected at a pH range of 4.0-8.5 by applying 1 mg of proteins. Furthermore, the same fractions showing peaks with high absorbance intensities in second dimension were collected and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry analysis for identification. The results showed that the 2-DL provides high reproducibility of two-dimensional protein map, and lends fractions to subsequent mass spectrometry analysis without the further need for extraction or solubilization of samples as required for spots excised from 2-DE gels. In addition, this system also allows to separate particularly proteins with 40-9 kDa molecular weight.

<ABSTRACT>
RNA interference (RNAi), a sequence-specific RNA degradation mechanism mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), can be used not only as a research tool but also as a therapeutic strategy for viral infection. We demonstrated that intracellular expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting human cyclin T1 (hCycT1), a cellular factor essential for transcription of messenger and genomic RNAs from the long terminal repeat promoter of provirus of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), could effectively suppress the replication of HIV-1. We also showed that downregulation of hCycT1 did not cause apoptotic cell death, therefore, targeting cellular factor hCycT1 by shRNAs may provide an attractive approach for genetic therapy of HIV-1 infection in the future.

Protein phosphatase 4--from obscurity to vital functions.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 13;579(15):3278-86.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Protein phosphatase 4 (Ppp4) is a ubiquitous serine/threonine phosphatase in the PPP family that is now recognised to regulate a variety of cellular functions independently of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Regulatory subunits (R1 and R2) have been identified in mammals that interact with the catalytic subunit of Ppp4 (Ppp4c) and control its activity. Ppp4c-R2 complexes play roles in organelle assembly; not only are they essential for maturation of the centrosome, but they are also involved in spliceosomal assembly via interaction with the survival of motor neurons (SMNs) complex. Several cellular signalling routes, including NF-kappaB and the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways appear to be regulated by Ppp4. Emerging evidence indicates that Ppp4 may play a role in the DNA damage response and that Ppp4c-R1 complexes decrease the activity of a histone deacetylase, implicating Ppp4 in the regulation of chromatin activities. Antitumour agents, cantharidin and fostriecin, potently inhibit the activity of Ppp4. Orthologues of mammalian Ppp4 subunits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae confer resistance to the anticancer, DNA-binding drugs, cisplatin and oxaliplatin.

<ABSTRACT>
The interactions between the TCR and peptides bound to class I MHC encoded molecules (pMHC) and a mechanism for CD8 cooperation in this process are reviewed. Observation of two TCR/CD8 populations with different lateral diffusion rate constants as well as two distinct association phases of class I MHC tetramers ((pMHC)4) with T-cells suggest that the most efficient pMHC-T-cell association route corresponds to a fast tetramer binding to a colocalized CD8/TCR population, which apparently resides within membrane rafts. Thus, ligand-cell association starts by pMHC binding to the CD8. This rather fast step promotes pMHC association with CD8-proximal TCRs and thereby enhances the overall association process. The model suggests that this raft-associated CD8-TCR subpopulation is responsible for evoking T-cell activation.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cytochrome c550 (cyt c550) from photosystem II (PSII) exists in the PSII-bound form but can be released from PSII by treatment with divalent cations or Tris, yielding the isolated form. We calculated heme redox potentials (Em) based on the crystal structures of cyt c550 by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. In the isolated form, the calculated Em are -240 mV at pH 6.0 and -352 mV at pH 9.0. This pH-dependence is predominantly due to deprotonation of the heme-propionic group near Asn-49. In the PSII-bound form, the calculated E(m) was up-shifted by 160 mV versus the isolated form due to a conformational change of protein backbone, yielding Em=-84 mV.

The resonance Raman spectrum provides evidence for a strongly hydrogen-bonded Schiff base like in mammalian rhodopsin but unlike to the homologous pSRII from Natronobacterium pharaonis. Laser flash spectroscopy indicates that SRII in detergent as well as after reconstitution into polar lipids shows its typical photochemical properties with prolonged photocycle kinetics. The first functional heterologous expression of SRII from H. salinarum provides the basis for studies with its cognate transducer HtrII to investigate the molecular processes involved in phototransduction as well as in chemotransduction.

Activation of alternative oxidase and uncoupling protein lowers hydrogen
peroxide formation in amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii mitochondria.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3136-40.

<ABSTRACT>
Mitochondria of amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii were used to determine the role of two energy-dissipating systems, i.e., a free fatty acid (FFA)-activated, purine nucleotide-inhibited uncoupling protein (AcUCP) and a FFA-insensitive, purine nucleotide-activated ubiquinol alternative oxidase (AcAOX), in decreasing reactive oxygen species production in unicellular organisms. It is shown that the activation of AcUCP by externally added FFA resulted in a strong decrease in H2O2 production, whilst the inhibition of the FFA acid-induced AcUCP activity by GDP or addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) enhanced production of H2O2. Similarly, the activation of antimycin-resistant AcAOX-mediated respiration by GMP significantly lowered H2O2 production, while inhibition of the oxidase by benzohydroxamate cancelled the GMP-induced effect on H2O2 production. When active together, both energy-dissipating systems revealed a cumulative effect on decreasing H2O2 formation. The results suggest that protection against mitochondrial oxidative stress may be a physiological role of AOX and UCP in unicellulars, such as A. castellanii.

Resveratrol-Cu(II) induced DNA breakage in human peripheral lymphocytes:
implications for anticancer properties.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3131-5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxy stilbene), a plant derived polyphenol found in mulberries, grapes and red wine is considered to possess chemopreventive properties against cancer. It is recognized as a naturally occurring antioxidant but also catalyzes oxidative DNA degradation in vitro in the presence of transition metal ions such as copper. Using a cellular system of lymphocytes isolated from human peripheral blood and Comet assay, we have confirmed that resveratrol-Cu(II) system is indeed capable of causing DNA degradation in cells such as lymphocytes. Also, trans-stilbene, which does not have any hydroxyl groups, is inactive in the lymphocyte system. Pre-incubation of lymphocytes with resveratrol indicates that it is capable of either traversing the cell membrane or binding to it. Our results are in partial support of our hypothesis that anticancer properties of various plant derived polyphenols may involve mobilization of endogenous copper and the consequent prooxidant action.

Peroxynitrite-mediated matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation in human
hepatic stellate cells.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
To investigate whether hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) alter their expression of MMPs after exposure to nitrogen oxide intermediate (NOI), a human hepatic stellate cell line, LI90 cells, was stimulated with an NO donor, SNAP, or a peroxynitrite donor, SIN-1, and the culture supernatants were analyzed by gelatin zymography or anti-MMPs immunoblot. Although SIN-1 did not enhance the secretions of MMP-1 and 13, SIN-1 induced the NF-kappaB activation, MT1-MMP expression and the secretion of activated MMP-2 in LI90 cells. These results suggest that peroxynitrite may contribute to the remodeling of the extracellular matrix in liver by activating pro-MMP-2.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) variously modified with 4'-thioribonucleosides against the Photinus luciferase gene were tested for their induction of the RNA interference (RNAi) activity in cultured NIH/3T3 cells. Results indicated that modifications at the sense-strand were well tolerated for RNAi activity except for full modification with 4'-thioribonucleosides. However, the activity of siRNAs modified at the antisense-strand was dependent on the position and the number of modifications with 4'-thioribonucleosides. Since modifications of siRNAs with 4'-thioribonucleosides were well tolerated in RNAi activity compared with that of 2'-O-methyl nucleosides, 4'-thioribonucleosides might be potentially useful in the development of novel and effective chemically modified siRNAs.

SSTR5 ablation in islet results in alterations in glucose homeostasis in
mice.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3107-14.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Somatostatin (SST) peptide is a potent inhibitor of insulin secretion and its effect is mediated via somatostatin receptor 5 (SSTR5) in the endocrine pancreas. To investigate the consequences of gene ablation of SSTR5 in the mouse pancreas, we have generated a mouse model in which the SSTR5 gene was specifically knocked down in the pancreatic beta cells (betaSSTR5Kd) using the Cre-lox system. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that SSTR5 gene expression was absent in beta cells at three months of age. At the time of gene ablation, betaSSTR5Kd mice demonstrated glucose intolerance with lack of insulin response and significantly reduced serum insulin levels. Insulin tolerance test demonstrated a significant increase of insulin clearance in vivo at the same age. In vitro studies demonstrated an absence of response to SST-28 stimulation in the betaSSTR5Kd mouse islet, which was associated with a significantly reduced SST expression level in betaSSTR5Kd mice pancreata. In addition, betaSSTR5Kd mice had significantly reduced serum glucose levels and increased serum insulin levels at 12 months of age. Glucose tolerance test at an older age also indicated a persistently higher insulin level in betaSSTR5Kd mice. Further studies of betaSSTR5Kd mice had revealed elevated serum C-peptide levels at both 3 and 12 months of age, suggesting that these mice are capable of producing and releasing insulin to the periphery. These results support the hypothesis that SSTR5 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of insulin secretion in the mouse pancreas.

Mitotic requirement for aurora A kinase is bypassed in the absence of
aurora B kinase.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 20;579(16):3385-91.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We investigated why treatment of cells with dual aurora A and B kinase inhibitors produces phenotypes identical to inactivation of aurora B. We found that dual aurora kinase inhibitors in fact potently inhibit cellular activities of both kinases, indicating that inactivation of aurora B bypasses aurora A in mitosis. RNAi experiments further established that inactivation of aurora B indeed bypasses the requirement for aurora A and leads to polyploidy. Inactivation of aurora A activates checkpoint kinase BubR1 in an aurora B-dependent manner. Our results thus show that aurora B is responsible for mitotic arrest in the absence of aurora A.

SNAT2 silencing prevents the osmotic induction of transport system A and

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 20;579(16):3376-80.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Under hypertonic conditions the induction of SLC38A2/SNAT2 leads to the stimulation of transport system A and to the increase in the cell content of amino acids. In hypertonically stressed human fibroblasts transfection with two siRNAs for SNAT2 suppressed the increase in SNAT2 mRNA and the stimulation of system A transport activity. Under the same condition, the expansion of the intracellular amino acid pool was significantly lowered and cell volume recovery markedly delayed. It is concluded that the up-regulation of SNAT2 is essential for the rapid restoration of cell volume after hypertonic stress.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 20;579(16):3411-5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) is a mitochondrial protein expressed mainly in skeletal muscle. Among several hypotheses for its physiological function, UCP3 has been proposed to prevent excessive production of reactive oxygen species. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of an oxidative stress induced by hyperoxia on UCP3 expression in mouse skeletal muscle and C2C12 myotubes. We found that the hyperoxia-mediated oxidative stress was associated with a 5-fold and 3-fold increase of UCP3 mRNA and protein levels, respectively, in mouse muscle. Hyperoxia also enhanced reactive oxygen species production and UCP3 mRNA expression in C2C12 myotubes. Our findings support the view that both in vivo and in vitro UCP3 may modulate reactive oxygen species production in response to an oxidative stress.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Protein sumoylation is an important reversible post-translational modification of proteins in the nucleus, and it orchestrates a variety of the cellular processes. Genome-wide analysis of functional abundance and distribution of Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier (SUMO) substrates may shed a light on how sumoylation is involved in nuclear biological processes and functions. Two interesting questions about sumoylation have emerged: (1) how many SUMO substrates exist in mammalian proteomes, such as human and mouse, (2) and what are their functions and how are they involved in a variety of biological processes? To address these two questions,we present an in silico genome-scale analysis for SUMO substrates in human. Based on the pattern recognition and phylogenetic conservation, we retrieved a list of 2683 potential SUMO substrates conserved in both human and mouse. Then, by functional enrichment analysis, we surveyed the over-represented GO terms and functional domains of them against the whole human proteome. Besides the consistence between our analyses and in vivo or in vitro work, the in silico predicted candidates also point to several potential roles of sumoylation, e.g., perception of sound. These potential SUMO substrates in human are of great value for further in vivo or in vitro experimental analysis.

Insulin and IGF-1 regulate the expression of the pituitary tumor
transforming gene (PTTG) in breast tumor cells.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3195-200.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The pituitary tumor transforming Gene (PTTG) is an oncogene that is highly expressed in most tumors analyzed to date. Here, we report the effects of insulin and the insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) on the expression of PTTG. Using MCF-7 cells, a human breast cancer cell line, we observed that both insulin and IGF-1 upregulate the expression of PTTG mRNA by approximately 2.5-fold. Induction of PTTG mRNA expression by insulin or IGF-1 was completely blocked by the specific phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3 kinase inhibitor LY294002, but partially blocked by the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059. Pretreatment of MCF-7 cells with actinomycin D completely blocked the stimulatory effect of insulin. Transfection of MCF-7 cells with a PTTG promoter-luciferase reporter construct revealed the dose-dependent stimulation of PTTG promoter activity by insulin, suggesting that the increase in PTTG expression by insulin is a result of activation of transcription of the PTTG gene. Taken together, our results suggest that insulin and IGF-1 regulate the expression of PTTG in MCF-7 cells primarily through the activation of PI3K/AKT cascade.

Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression in adipocytes: a new
component in fat metabolism.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3183-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is a carrier of triglyceride essential for the assembly of apolipoprotein (apo)B-containing lipoproteins by the liver and the small intestine. Its role in triglyceride transfer in tissues that do not secrete lipoproteins has not been explored. In particular, MTP would seem to be a candidate for a role in triglyceride metabolism within the adipocyte. To test this hypothesis, we probed adipocytes for the presence of MTP. Immunohistochemical and biochemical studies demonstrate MTP in adipocytes from brown and white fat depots of mice and human, as well as in 3T3-L1 cells. Confocal microscopy revealed MTP throughout 3T3 cells; however, MTP fluorescence was prominent in juxtanuclear areas. In differentiated 3T3 cells MTP fluorescence was very striking around lipid droplets. In vitro lipid transfer assays demonstrated the presence of triglyceride transfer activity within microsomal fractions isolated from rat adipose tissue. In addition, quantitative rtPCR studies showed that MTP expression in mouse white fat depots was approximately 1% of MTP expression in mouse liver. MTP mRNA in differentiated 3T3 cells was approximately 13% of liver expression. Our results provide unequivocal evidence for the presence of MTP in adipocytes and present new possibilities for defining the mechanisms by which triglyceride is stored and/or hydrolyzed and mobilized.

A putative novel alpha/beta hydrolase ORFan family in Bacillus.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 6;579(14):3175-82.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A large number of sequences in each newly sequenced genome correspond to lineage and species-specific proteins, also known as ORFans. Amongst these ORFans, a large number are sequences with unknown structures and functions. We have identified a family of sequences, annotated as hypothetical proteins, which are specific to Bacillus and have carried out a computational study aimed at characterizing this family. Fold-recognition methods predict that these sequences belong to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold. We suggest possible catalytic triads for the ORFans and propose a hypothesis regarding the possible families within the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily to which they may belong.

<ABSTRACT>
Recent advance in understanding the role of toxin proteins in controlling cell death has revealed that pro-apoptotic viral proteins targeting mitochondria contain amphiphilic alpha-helices with pore-forming properties. Herein, we describe that the pore-forming amphiphilic beta-sheet cardiotoxins (or cytotoxins, CTXs) from Taiwan cobra (Naja atra) also target mitochondrial membrane after internalization and act synergistically with CTX-induced cytosolic calcium increase to disrupt mitochondria network. It is suggested that CTX-induced fragmentation of mitochondria play a role in controlling CTX-induced necrosis of myocytes and cause severe tissue necrosis in the victims.

<ABSTRACT>
The NuoF subunit, which harbors NADH-binding site, of Escherichia coli NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (NDH-1) contains five conserved cysteine residues, four of which are predicted to ligate cluster N3. To determine this coordination, we overexpressed and purified the NuoF subunit and NuoF+E subcomplex in E. coli. We detected two distinct EPR spectra, arising from a [4Fe-4S] cluster (g(x,y,z)=1.90, 1.95, and 2.05) in NuoF, and a [2Fe-2S] cluster (g(x,y,z)=1.92, 1.95, and 2.01) in NuoE subunit. These clusters were assigned to clusters N3 and N1a, respectively. Based on the site-directed mutagenesis experiments, we identified that cluster N3 is ligated to the 351Cx2Cx2Cx40C398 motif.

<ABSTRACT>
In this study, we demonstrate that pretreatment with aspirin inhibits GH-induced insulin resistance. GH was observed to lead to serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, a phenomenon which was reversed by aspirin in liver, muscle and WAT in parallel with a reduction in JNK activity. In addition, our data show an impairment of insulin activation in the IR/IRS/PI(3)kinase pathway and a reduction in IRS-1 protein levels in rats treated with GH, which was also reversed in the animals pretreated with aspirin. Overall, these results provide new insights into the mechanism of GH-induced insulin resistance.

<ABSTRACT>
The identification of specific protein markers for colorectal cancer would provide the basis for early diagnosis and detection, as well as clues for understanding the molecular mechanisms governing cancer progression. In this report, we describe the proteomic analysis of the samples of colorectal cancer corresponding to seven patients. We have used the highly sensitive two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) for the identification of proteins differentially expressed in tumoral and neighboring normal mucosa. We have detected differences in abundance of 52 proteins with statistical variance of the tumor versus normal spot volume ratio within the 95th confidence level (Student's t-test; p < 0.05). Forty-one out of 52 analyzed proteins were unambiguously identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight MS coupled with database interrogation as being differentially expressed in colorectal cancer. An ontology analysis of these proteins revealed that they were mainly involved in regulation of transcription (synovial sarcoma X5 protein, metastasis-associated protein 1), cellular reorganization and cytoskeleton (cytokeratins, vimentin, beta actin), cell communication and signal transduction (annexins IV and V, relaxin, APC), and protein synthesis and folding (heat shock protein 60, calreticulin, cathepsin D, RSP4) among others. Preliminary studies demonstrated that the differentially expressed proteins found by 2-D DIGE could be confirmed and validated by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry analyses in those few cases where antibodies were available. We believe that the incorporation of more samples and new datasets will permit the definition of a collection of proteins with a potential interest as biomarkers for colorectal cancer.

<ABSTRACT>
Oxygen-derived free radicals produced by phagocytes have been postulated to contribute to lung tissue damage occurring during diffuse lung diseases (DLD). The two-dimensional electrophoretic (2-DE) analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein composition revealed different protein profiles in sarcoidosis (S), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) with a significant increase of low molecular weight proteins in IPF. Some of these proteins are involved in antioxidant processes. The aims of this report were to analyse the oxidative stress occurring in patients with DLD through determination of BAL protein carbonyl content and to identify target proteins of oxidation by a proteomic approach (2-DE combined with immunoblotting with specific antibodies for carbonyl groups). Carbonylated proteins detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were increased in BAL of patients with S, IPF and SSc compared to healthy controls with a significant difference for S and IPF. The proteomic approach to the analysis of BAL revealed that protein carbonylation was a process involving specific carbonylation-sensitive proteins and that in IPF a greater number of proteins target of oxidation were present. In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the first report providing a database of proteins target of oxidation in BAL of patients with sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and systemic sclerosis.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(10):2665-79.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In order to identify new molecular markers for pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasias (PanINs), the precursor lesions of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, we established a proteomics approach analysing microdissected PanIN cells. Due to the limited amount of proteins available from microdissection, we developed a procedure including fluorescence dye saturation labelling in combination with high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. With this procedure we were able to analyse proteins extracted from 1000 microdissected cells with a high resolution of up to 2500 protein spots. Using protein lysates from the pancreatic carcinoma tissue as a reference proteome, we were able to successfully identify the proteins. Thus, we could match approximately 2200 protein spots (92%) of the microdissected sample proteome to the reference proteome for protein identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry and nanoliquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry after in-gel digestion. The first proteome analysis of microdissected PanIN-2 grades revealed eight differentially expressed proteins. The differential expression of the three actin filament-associated proteins--transgelin, vimentin and MRCL3 as well as actin itself--indicates a relevant role of the actin cytoskeleton during pancreatic tumour progression. Additionally, two members of the annexin family (annexin A2 and A4) implicate a functional contribution of exocytotic and endocytotic pathways at that stage.

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(10):2656-64.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Serum is a readily available source for diagnostic assays, but the identification of disease-specific serum biomarkers has been impeded by the dominance of human serum albumin and immunoglobulins (Igs) in the serum proteome. There is a need to reduce the technical variation in serum processing and analysis to allow for a reproducible analysis of large cohorts. To this end, we have developed a rapid and reproducible procedure for sample preparation and high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to analyze human serum. Serum is centrifuged at high speed to remove lipids and aggregated proteins, incubated with protein G resin to remove IgG, precipitated with NaCl/ethanol to deplete albumin, and slowly resolubilized in a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)/N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-2'-(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES) buffer. The delipidated and IgG/albumin depleted serum proteins are focused on pH 4-7 linear large immobilized pH gradient strips, and then resolved by Bis-Tris SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The robustness and reproducibility of the optimized procedure was determined for three individual serum samples on three consecutive days. An image analysis of the nine silver-stained gels demonstrated that the intensity and localization of protein spots are highly reproducible. Our IgG and albumin depletion procedure will aid in screening the patient sera for normal biological variation and disease-specific biomarkers.

Comparison of protein expression in human deltoideus and vastus lateralis

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(10):2577-86.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) to study the expression of contractile and regulatory proteins in human vastus lateralis and deltoideus muscles, in order to understand protein turnover and isoform switching in muscles with the same fiber-type composition but different functional properties. We demonstrate a two- to six-fold overexpression of enzymes associated with glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and substrate transport in vastus lateralis compared to deltoideus. Expression levels of contractile protein isoforms correlated to the proportion of slow-twitch fibers in deltoideus compared to vastus lateralis are consistent with the different contractile properties of the two muscles. Two proteins involved in free radical homeostasis were differentially expressed, suggesting a direct relationship between radical scavenging and the muscle function. The application of 2-DE and MS to studies of muscle physiology thus offers a more comprehensive assessment of the molecular determinants of muscle function than traditional approaches.

<ABSTRACT>
HepG2 cells, stably transfected with MDR1 cDNA, encoding the P-glycoprotein multidrug resistance efflux pump, display an altered sphingolipid composition compared to control cells, stably transfected with empty vector. The MDR1 overexpressing cells display a approximately 3-fold increased level of lactosylceramide and an increased ganglioside mass. Both the mRNA and the activity of lactosylceramide synthase were increased in HepG2/MDR1 cells. In conclusion, the increased glycolipid content in MDR1-transfected HepG2 cells is caused by a transcriptional up-regulation of the enzyme lactosylceramide synthase.

Since the prediction of residue secondary structure by one residue window sliding make ambiguity in state prediction, we used a dynamic programming algorithm to find the path with maximum score. A score system for residue pairs in particular conformations is derived for adjacent neighbors up to ten residue apart in sequence. The three state overall per-residue accuracy, Q3, of this method in a jackknife test with dataset created from PDBSELECT is more than 70%.

<ABSTRACT>
Proteome analysis of Gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogen Francisella tularensis (F. tularensis) live vaccine strain has been performed only on whole-cell extracts so far. This is the first study dealing with the analysis of the membrane subproteome of this microorganism. A fraction enriched in membrane proteins obtained by carbonate extraction was separated using two-dimensional electrophoresis and all visualized spots were identified by mass spectrometry. The reference map is the basis for further comparative analyses of virulent and non-virulent F. tularensis strains.

De novo sequence analysis of N-terminal sulfonated peptides after in-gel
guanidination.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Jun;5(9):2369-80.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Here we report a novel approach in which gel-separated proteins are guanidinated in-gel prior to enzymatic cleavage. In contrast to previously described techniques, this procedure allows the extracted tryptic peptides to be N-terminal sulfonated without any further sample purification. The derivatized peptides were subsequently fragmented using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight/time of flight instrument. The approach facilitates the de novo sequence analysis and allows obtaining longer stretches of amino acid sequence information. We demonstrate that the obtained information can be used to identify proteins using a sequence similarity search algorithm. The technique was compared to the standard peptide mass fingerprint approach, applied either in-gel or in solution, using a number of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separated model proteins. Finally, the new protocol was applied on a proteomic study of two-dimensional PAGE separated proteins from Shewanella oneidensis. More than 50 proteins from this organism were identified using sub-picomol quantities of protein, and peptide sequences of up to 20 amino acid residues in length have been determined.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2819-38.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteomics methods were used to characterize proteins that change their form or abundance in the nucleus of NRK49F rat kidney fibroblasts during prolonged hypoxia (1% O(2), 12 h). Of the 791 proteins that were monitored, about 20% showed detectable changes. The 51 most abundant proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Changes in nuclear receptor transcription factors (THRalpha1, RORalpha4, HNF4alpha, NUR77), other transcription factors (GATA1, AP-2alpha, OCT1, ATF6alpha, ZFP161, ZNF354A, PDCD2), and transcription cofactors (PC4, PCAF, MTA1, TCEA1, JMY) are indicative of major, co-ordinated changes in transcription. Proteins involved in DNA repair/recombination, ribosomal RNA synthesis, RNA processing, nuclear transport, nuclear organization, protein translation, glycolysis, lipid metabolism, several protein kinases (PKCdelta, MAP3K4, GRK3), as well as proteins with no established functional role were also observed. The observed proteins suggest nuclear regulatory roles for proteins involved in cytosolic processes such as glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism, and roles in overall nuclear structure/organization for proteins previously associated with meiosis and/or spermatogenesis (synaptonemal complex proteins 1 and 2 (SYCP1, SYCP2), meiosis-specific nuclear structural protein 1 (MNS1), LMNC2, zinc finger protein 99 (ZFP99)). Proteins associated with cytoplasmic membrane functions (ACTN4, hyaluronan mediated motility receptor (RHAMM), VLDLR, GRK3) and/or endocytosis (DNM2) were also seen. For 30% of the identified proteins, new isoforms indicative of alternative transcription were detected (e.g., GATA1, ATF6alpha, MTA1, MLH1, MYO1C, UBF, SYCP2, EIF3S10, MAP3K4, ZFP99). Comparison with proteins involved in cell death, cancer, and testis/meiosis/spermatogenesis suggests commonalities, which may reflect fundamental mechanisms for down-regulation of cellular function.

A crevice adjoining the ribosome tunnel: hints for cotranslational

<ABSTRACT>
RNA protection experiments and the crystal structure of a complex of the large ribosomal subunit from the eubacterium Deinococcus radiodurans with rapamycin, a polyketide compound resembling macrolides and ketolides, showed that rapamycin binds to a crevice located at the boundaries of the nascent protein exit tunnel, near its entrance. At this location rapamycin cannot occlude the ribosome exit tunnel, consistent with its failure to act as a ribosomal antibiotic drug. In accord with recent biochemical data, this crevice may play a role in facilitating local cotranslational folding of nascent chains, in particular for transmembrane proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
The 26S proteasome is a large multi-protein complex that functions to degrade proteins tagged with multi-ubiquitin chains. There are several mechanisms employed by the cell to ensure the efficient delivery of multi-ubiquitinated substrate proteins to the 26S proteasome. This is not only important to ensure the degradation of damaged and misfolded proteins, but also the regulated turnover of critical cell regulators. This discussion will concentrate on what is known about the recognition and delivery of ubiquitinated substrate proteins to the 26S proteasome.

<ABSTRACT>
Endocytosis is a versatile tool to regulate the intensity, localization, half-life and function of signaling complexes (signalosomes) that form in cells upon binding of growth factors, cytokines and morphogens to their cognate receptors. Endocytic adaptors are non-catalytic proteins that assemble effectors and structural components of the endocytic machinery around the trafficking cargo and serve as scaffolds for signalosomes, which in turn modify their location and activity by various post-translational modifications. We discuss how breakdowns in the function of endocytic adaptors might facilitate impairment of tissue homeostasis and consequent tumor development.

<ABSTRACT>
CULLIN (CUL)-dependent ubiquitin ligases form a class of structurally related multi-subunit enzymes that control the rapid and selective degradation of important regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle progression and development, among others. Several classes of these E3s are also conserved in plants and genetic analyses, using Arabidopsis thaliana, indicate that they play an important function during plant development and responses to the environment. In this review, we will discuss the molecular composition and function of these enzymes in plants with a major emphasis on phytohormone signal transduction pathways.

<ABSTRACT>
Circadian clocks, internal timekeepers that generate a daily rhythmicity, help organisms to be prepared for periodic environmental changes of light and temperature. These molecular clocks are transcriptional feedback loops that generate 24-h oscillations in the abundance of clock proteins. For the maintenance of this rhythm inside the core clockwork and for its transmission to downstream genes the clock proteins additionally rely on post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. Thus clock proteins engage in a variety of interactions with DNA, RNA and other proteins. Based on the model organisms Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana molecular principles of circadian clocks are discussed in this review.

Structure and functional role of supercomplexes of IsiA and Photosystem I

</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 13;579(15):3253-7. Epub 2005 Apr 7.

<ABSTRACT>
Cyanobacteria express large quantities of the iron stress-inducible protein IsiA under iron deficiency. IsiA can assemble into numerous types of single or double rings surrounding Photosystem I. These supercomplexes are functional in light-harvesting, empty IsiA rings are effective energy dissipaters. Electron microscopy studies of these supercomplexes show that Photosystem I trimers bind 18 IsiA copies in a single ring, whereas monomers may bind up to 35 copies in two rings. Work on mutants indicates that the PsaF/J and PsaL subunits facilitate the formation of closed rings around Photosystem I monomers but are not obligatory components in the formation of Photosystem I-IsiA supercomplexes.

<ABSTRACT>
Understanding the molecular organisation of intracellular signalling pathways is a topic of considerable research interest. Since many signalling enzymes are widely distributed and have several substrates, a critical component in signal transduction is the control of specificity. This is achieved, in part by the assembly of multiprotein complexes where clusters of signalling enzymes create focal points to disseminate the intracellular action of many hormones. This is particularly true for the cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) that is localised throughout the cell via its association with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Recent data suggest that some AKAPs also interact with phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Compartmentalisation of PDEs not only provides an elegant means to control PKA activation by monitoring the local cAMP flux, but also serves to concentrate and segregate the action of these important regulatory enzymes.

<ABSTRACT>
More than 20 years ago, Raf was discovered as a cellular oncogene transduced by transforming retroviruses. Since then, the three Raf isoforms have been intensively studied, mainly as the kinases linking Ras to the MEK/ERK signaling module. As this pathway is activated in human cancer, the Raf kinases are considered promising therapeutic targets, and we have learned a lot about their regulation, targets, and functions. Do they still hold surprises? Recent gene targeting studies indicate that they do. This review focuses on the regulation and biology of the best-studied Raf isoform, Raf-1, in the context of its kinase-independent functions.

<ABSTRACT>
Programmed neuronal cell death is required during development to achieve the accurate wiring of the nervous system. However, genetic or accidental factors can lead to the premature, non-programmed death of neurons during adult life. Inappropriate death of cells in the nervous system is the cause of multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Pathological neuronal death can occur by apoptosis, by necrosis or by a combination of both. Necrotic cell death underlies the pathology of devastating neurological diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, stroke or trauma. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that bring about necrotic cell death. Proteases play crucial roles in neuron degeneration by exerting both regulatory and catabolic functions. Elevated intracellular calcium is the most ubiquitous feature of neuronal death with the concomitant activation of cysteine calcium-dependent proteases, calpains. Calpains and lysosomal, catabolic aspartyl proteases, play key roles in the necrotic death of neurons. In this review, we survey the recent literature on the role of cysteine and aspartyl proteases in necrosis and neurodegeneration, aiming to delineate common proteolytic mechanisms mediating cellular destruction.

Transglutaminase 2 in the balance of cell death and survival.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 13;579(15):3297-302. Epub 2005 Apr 7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a multifunctional enzyme with Ca(2+)-dependent protein crosslinking activity and GTP-dependent G protein functions, is often upregulated in cells undergoing apoptosis. In cultured cells TG2 may exert both pro- and anti-apoptotic effects depending upon the type of cell, the kind of death stimuli, the intracellular localization of the enzyme and the type of its activities switched on. The majority of data support the notion that transamidation by TG2 can both facilitate and inhibit apoptosis, while the GTP-bound form of the enzyme generally protects cells against death. In vivo studies confirm the Janus face of TG2 in the initiation of the apoptotic program. In addition, they reveal a further role: the prevention of inflammation, tissue injury and autoimmunity once the apoptosis has already been initiated. This function of TG2 is partially achieved by being expressed and activated also in macrophages digesting apoptotic cells and mediating a crosstalk between dying and phagocytic cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Cardiovascular disease is responsible for 17 million deaths per year but acute myocardial infarction and stroke can be treated with thrombolytics ("clot busters"), which are plasminogen activators. However, despite many years of study and huge investment from the pharmaceutical industry, clinical trials of new drugs have often been disappointing. Part of the problem may be our incomplete understanding of the regulation of plasminogen activation in vivo. We have developed precise in vitro methods and with the application of computer simulations, we hope to improve our understanding of plasminogen activation to facilitate improvements in thrombolytic therapy.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The anticoagulant protein C system regulates the activity of coagulation factors VIIIa and Va, cofactors in the activation of factor X and prothrombin, respectively. Protein C is activated on endothelium by the thrombin-thrombomodulin-EPCR (endothelial protein C receptor) complex. Activated protein C (APC)-mediated cleavages of factors VIIIa and Va occur on negatively charged phospholipid membranes and involve protein cofactors, protein S and factor V. APC also has anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities that involve binding of APC to EPCR and cleavage of PAR-1 (protease-activated receptor-1). Genetic defects affecting the protein C system are the most common risk factors of venous thrombosis. The protein C system contains multi-domain proteins, the molecular recognition of which will be reviewed.

<ABSTRACT>
Meprins are unique plasma membrane and secreted metalloproteinases that are highly regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. Meprin alpha and beta subunits are abundantly expressed in kidney and intestinal epithelial cells, are secreted into the urinary tract and intestinal lumen, and are found in leukocytes and cancer cells under certain conditions. Their location and proteolytic activities indicate functions at the interface of the host and the external environment, and in trafficking of macrophages and metastases of cancer cells. These proteases can be detrimental when there is tissue damage or disruption, as in acute renal injury or intestinal inflammation, and there is evidence they are involved in movement of leukocytes and cancer cells to sites of infection or in metastasis, respectively.

The matrilins--adaptor proteins in the extracellular matrix.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 13;579(15):3323-9. Epub 2005 Mar 22.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The matrilins form a four-member family of modular, multisubunit matrix proteins, which are expressed in cartilage but also in many other forms of extracellular matrix. They participate in the formation of fibrillar or filamentous structures and are often associated with collagens. It appears that they mediate interactions between collagen-containing fibrils and other matrix constituents, such as aggrecan. This adaptor function may be modulated by physiological proteolysis that causes the loss of single subunits and thereby a decrease in binding avidity. Attempts to study matrilin function by gene inactivation in mouse have been frustrating and so far not yielded pronounced phenotypes, presumably because of the extensive redundancy within the family allowing compensation by one family member for another. However, mutations in matrilin-3 in humans cause different forms of chondrodysplasias and perhaps also hand osteoarthritis. As loss of matrilin-3 is not critical in mouse, these phenotypes are likely to be caused by dominant negative effects.

<ABSTRACT>
Intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs) are common in various proteomes and occupy a unique structural and functional niche in which function is directly linked to structural disorder. The evidence that these proteins exist without a well-defined folded structure in vitro is compelling, and justifies considering them a separate class within the protein world. In this paper, novel advances in the rapidly advancing field of IUPs are reviewed, with the major attention directed to the evidence of their unfolded character in vivo, the interplay of their residual structure and their various functional modes and the functional benefits their malleable structural state provides. Via all these details, it is demonstrated that in only a couple of years after its conception, the idea of protein disorder has already come of age and transformed our basic concepts of protein structure and function.

Seven distinct genome-wide divergence measures were applied pairwise to the nine sequenced animal genomes of human, mouse, rat, chicken, pufferfish, fruit fly, mosquito, and two nematode worms (Caenorhabditis briggsae and Caenorhabditis elegans). Qualitatively, all of these divergence measures are found to correlate with the estimated time since speciation; however, marked deviations are observed in a few lineages. The distinct genome divergence measures also correlate well among themselves, indicating that most of the processes shaping genomes are dominated by neutral events. The deviations from the clock-like scenario in some lineages are observed consistently by several measures, implicitly confirming their reliability.

<ABSTRACT>
Cholera still remains an important global predicament especially in India and other developing countries. Vibrio cholerae, the etiologic agent of cholera, colonizes the small intestine and produces an enterotoxin that is largely responsible for the watery diarrheal symptoms of the disease. Using RNA arbitrarily primed PCR, ND5 a mitochondria encoded subunit of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain was found to be upregulated in the human intestinal epithelial cell line Int407 following exposure to V. cholerae. The upregulation of ND5 was not observed when Int407 was infected with Escherichia coli strains. Incubation with heat-killed V. cholerae or cholera toxin or culture supernatant also showed no such upregulation indicating the involvement of live bacteria in the process. Infection of the monolayer with aflagellate non-motile mutant of V. cholerae O395 showed a very significant (59-fold) downregulation of ND5. In contrast, a remarkable upregulation of ND5 expression (200-fold) was observed in a hyperadherent icmF insertion mutant with reduced motility. V. cholerae cheY4 null mutant defective in adherence and motility also resulted in significantly reduced levels of ND5 expression while mutant with the cheY4 gene duplicated showing increased adherence and motility resulted in increased expression of ND5. These results clearly indicate that both motility and adherence to intestinal epithelial cells are possible triggering factors contributing to ND5 mRNA expression by V. cholerae. Interestingly infection with insertion mutant in the gene coding for ToxR, the master regulator of virulence in V. cholerae resulted in significant downregulation of ND5 expression. However, infection with ctxA or toxT insertion mutants did not show any significant changes in ND5 expression compared to wild-type. Almost no expression of ND5 was observed in case of mutation in the gene coding for OmpU, a ToxR activated protein. Thus, infection of Int407 with virulence mutant strains of V. cholerae revealed that the ND5 expression is modulated by the virulence of V. cholerae in a ToxT independent manner. Although no difference in the mitochondrial copy number could be detected between infected and uninfected cells, the modulation of the expression of other mitochondrial genes were also observed. Incidentally, upon V. cholerae infection, complex I activity was found to increase about 3-folds after 6 h. This is the first report of alteration in mitochondrial gene expression upon infection of a non-invasive enteric bacterium like V. cholerae showing its modulation with adherence, motility and virulence of the organism.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 20;579(16):3421-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
This study was designed to investigate inducible intrinsic resistance against lactoferricin B in Staphylococcus aureus. Serial passage of seven S. aureus strains in medium with increasing concentrations of peptide resulted in an induced resistance at various levels in all strains. The induced resistance was unstable and decreased relatively rapidly during passages in peptide free medium but the minimum inhibitory concentration remained elevated after thirty passages. Cross-resistance to penicillin G and low-level cross-resistance to the antimicrobial peptides indolicidin and Ala(8,13,18)-magainin-II amide [corrected] was observed. No cross-resistance was observed to the human cathelicidin LL-37. In conclusion, this study shows that S. aureus has intrinsic resistance mechanisms against antimicrobial peptides that can be induced upon exposure, and that this may confer low-level cross-resistance to other antimicrobial peptides.

In many vertebrate tissues, cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) either hydrolyses or phosphorylates a number of purine (monophosphorylated) nucleosides through a scheme common to the Haloacid Dehalogenase superfamily members. It possesses a pivotal role in purine cellular metabolism and it acts on anti-tumoural and antiviral nucleoside analogues, thus being of potential therapeutic importance. cN-II is Mg2+-dependent, regulated and stabilised by several factors such as allosteric effectors ATP and 2,3-DPG, although these are not directly involved in the reaction stoichiometry. We review herein the experimental knowledge currently available about this remarkable enzymatic activity.

Structural conservation of residues in BH1 and BH2 domains of Bcl-2 family
proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
The sequence of Bcl-2 homology domains, BH1 and BH2, is known to be conserved among anti- and pro-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family proteins. But structural conservation of these domains with respect to functionally active residues playing role in heterodimerization-mediated regulation of apoptosis has never been elucidated. Here, we have suggested the formation of an active site by structurally conserved residues in BH1 (glycine, arginine) and BH2 (tryptophan) domains of Bcl-2 family members, which also accounts for the functional effect of known mutations in BH1 (G145A, G145E) and BH2 (W188A) domains of Bcl-2.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Arabidopsis phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PtdInsP) kinase 10 (AtPIPK10; At4g01190) is shown to be a functional enzyme of the subfamily A, type I AtPtdInsP kinases. It is biochemically distinct from AtPIPK1 (At1g21980), the only other previously characterized AtPtdInsP kinase which is of the B subfamily. AtPIPK10 has the same K(m), but a 10-fold lower V(max) than AtPIPK1 and it is insensitive to phosphatidic acid. AtPIPK10 transcript is most abundant in inflorescence stalks and flowers, whereas AtPIPK1 transcript is present in all tissues. Comparative analysis of recombinant AtPIPK10 and AtPIPK1 with recombinant HsPIPKIalpha reveals that the Arabidopsis enzymes have roughly 200- and 20-fold lower V(max)/K(m), respectively. These data reveal one explanation for the longstanding mystery of the relatively low phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate:phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate ratio in terrestrial plants.

<ABSTRACT>
The aggregation of a recombinant lipase as inclusion bodies (IBs) was studied directly within intact Escherichia coli cells by FT-IR microspectroscopy. Through this approach, it was possible to monitor in real time the different kinetics of IB formation at 37 and 27 degrees C, in excellent agreement with the results of the SDS-PAGE analysis. Furthermore, insights on the residual native-like structure of the expressed protein within IB--both isolated and inside cells--were obtained by the secondary structure analysis of the Amide I band in the IB FT-IR spectra.

<ABSTRACT>
Grifolin is a natural biologically active substance isolated from the fresh fruiting bodies of the mushroom Albatrellus confluens. Here, for the first time, we describe a novel activity of grifolin, namely its ability to inhibit the growth of tumor cells by the induction of apoptosis. Grifolin strongly inhibited the growth of tumor cell lines: CNE1, HeLa, MCF7, SW480, K562, Raji and B95-8. Analysis of acridine orange (AO)/ethidium bromide (EB) staining and flow cytometry showed that grifolin possessed apoptosis induction activity to CNE1, HeLa, MCF7 and SW480. Furthermore, the cytochrome c release from mitochondria was detected by confocal microscopy in CNE1 cells after a 12h treatment with grifolin. The increase of caspase-8, 9, 3 activities revealed that caspase was a key mediator of the apoptotic pathway induced by grifolin, and the underexpression of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax resulted in the increase of Bax: Bcl-2 ratio, suggesting that Bcl-2 family involved in the control of apoptosis. Owing to the combination of the significant antitumor activity by inducing apoptosis and natural abundance of the compound, grifolin holds the promise of being an interesting antitumor agent that deserves further laboratory and in vivo exploration.

Prediction of protein subcellular location using a combined feature of
sequence.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 20;579(16):3444-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
To understand the structure and function of a protein, an important task is to know where it occurs in the cell. Thus, a computational method for properly predicting the subcellular location of proteins would be significant in interpreting the original data produced by the large-scale genome sequencing projects. The present work tries to explore an effective method for extracting features from protein primary sequence and find a novel measurement of similarity among proteins for classifying a protein to its proper subcellular location. We considered four locations in eukaryotic cells and three locations in prokaryotic cells, which have been investigated by several groups in the past. A combined feature of primary sequence defined as a 430D (dimensional) vector was utilized to represent a protein, including 20 amino acid compositions, 400 dipeptide compositions and 10 physicochemical properties. To evaluate the prediction performance of this encoding scheme, a jackknife test based on nearest neighbor algorithm was employed. The prediction accuracies for cytoplasmic, extracellular, mitochondrial, and nuclear proteins in the former dataset were 86.3%, 89.2%, 73.5% and 89.4%, respectively, and the total prediction accuracy reached 86.3%. As for the prediction accuracies of cytoplasmic, extracellular, and periplasmic proteins in the latter dataset, the prediction accuracies were 97.4%, 86.0%, and 79.7, respectively, and the total prediction accuracy of 92.5% was achieved. The results indicate that this method outperforms some existing approaches based on amino acid composition or amino acid composition and dipeptide composition.

Zinc in lipase L1 from Geobacillus stearothermophilus L1 and structural
implications on thermal stability.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 20;579(16):3461-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Lipase L1 from Geobacillus stearothermophilus L1 contains an unusual extra domain, making a tight intramolecular interaction with the main catalytic domain through a Zn2+-binding coordination. To elucidate the role of the Zn2+, we disrupted the Zn2+-binding site by mutating the zinc-ligand residues (H87A, D61A/H87A, and D61A/H81A/H87A/D238A). The activity vs. temperature profiles of the mutant enzymes showed that the disruption of the Zn2+-binding site resulted in a notable decrease in the optimal temperature for maximal activity from 60 to 45-50 degrees C. The mutations also abolished the Zn2+-induced thermal stabilization. The wild-type enzyme revealed a 34.6-fold increase in stabilization with the addition of Zn2+ at 60 degrees C, whereas the mutant enzymes exhibited no response to Zn2+. Additional circular dichroism spectroscopy studies also confirmed the structural stabilizing role of Zn2+ on lipase L1 at elevated temperatures.

<ABSTRACT>
Diabetes is associated with an excess risk of cardiac events, and one of the risk factors for infarction is the elevated-levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). To evaluate how the molecular clock mechanism is involved in the diabetes-induced circadian augmentation of PAI-1 gene expression, we examined the expression profiles of PAI-1 mRNA in the hearts of Clock mutant mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Circadian expression of PAI-1 mRNA was blunted to low levels under both normal and diabetic conditions in Clock mutant mice, although the expression rhythm was augmented in diabetic wild-type (WT) mice. Furthermore, plasma PAI-1 levels became significantly higher in WT mice than in Clock mutant mice after STZ administration. Our results suggested that the circadian clock component, CLOCK, is involved in the diabetes-induced circadian augmentation of PAI-1 expression in the mouse heart.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We investigated the localization and functional expression of the ABC transporter ABCB1 in human fetal neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSPCs). RT-PCR analysis revealed ABCB1 gene expression in hNSPCs. We found a single band in immunoblotted hNSPCs lysates probed with ABCB1 antibody, and detected ABCB1 at the hNSPCs cell membrane by immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation. ABCB1 inhibitors and substrate, and ATP-depleting agents enhanced hNSPCs' rhodamine 123 accumulation, and hNSPCs microsomes had vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity. ABCB1 and nestin expression decreased during hNSPCs differentiation, while the astroglial marker GFAP increased. ABCB1 may maintain hNSPCs in an undifferentiated state and could be a neural stem/progenitor marker.

An in-gel digestion procedure that facilitates the identification of
highly hydrophobic proteins by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry
analysis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2729-38.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A procedure is described for in-gel tryptic digestion of proteins that allows the direct analysis of eluted peptides in electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometers without the need of a postdigestion desalting step. It is based on the following principles: (a) a thorough desalting of the protein in-gel before digestion that takes advantage of the excellent properties of acrylamide polymers for size exclusion separations, (b) exploiting the activity of trypsin in water, in the absence of inorganic buffers, and (c) a procedure for peptide extraction using solvents of proven efficacy with highly hydrophobic peptides. Quality of spectra and sequence coverage are equivalent to those obtained after digestion in ammonium bicarbonate for hydrophilic proteins detected with Coomassie blue, mass spectrometry-compatible silver or imidazole-zinc but are significantly superior for highly hydrophobic proteins, such as membrane proteins with several transmembrane domains. ATPase subunit 9 (GRAVY 1.446) is a membrane protein channel, lipid-binding protein for which both the conventional in-gel digestion protocol and in solution digestion failed. It was identified with very high sequence coverage. Sample handling after digestion is notably simplified as peptides are directly loaded into the ESI source without postdigestion processing, increasing the chances for the identification of hydrophobic peptides.

Mass profiling-directed isolation and identification of a stage-specific
serologic protein biomarker of advanced prostate cancer.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2927-38.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Carcinoma of the prostate (CaP) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality among American men. While high cure rates are associated with localized CaP, no cure exists for advanced recurrent disease. At present there are no known serologic biomarkers specific to this stage of the disease. Several groups have used mass spectrometry (MS) based mass profiling (MP) combined with multivariate analysis to identify diagnostically predictive protein peaks for CaP in serum and tissues. Nevertheless, an appreciable level of skepticism exists for MP attributed primarily to a lack of definitive protein characterization. To address this problem, we have applied an approach that combines MP with a whole-protein based top-down separation strategy for the identification of a stage-specific marker in a group comprising 16 patients with CaP (metastatic and localized disease) and 15 healthy individuals. MP, combined with multivariate analysis, yielded 17 serum proteins specific to metastatic disease. A single protein detected at m/z 7771 was found to be significantly decreased in the sera of all the metastatic CaP patients but not in localized CaP or healthy individuals. This protein was therefore chosen as the primary candidate for further analysis. The complex nature of the serologic proteome necessitated an isolation strategy that included a C18 prefractionation, followed by multidimensional liquid chromatography and, finally, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The separation process was monitored by UV-Vis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight MS analysis. This strategy was found to greatly facilitate subsequent MS characterization of the unknown protein, which was identified as platelet factor 4, a chemokine with prothrombolytic and antiangiogenic activities. Confirmation was achieved using both Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. With the growing interest in using MP for patient classification and diagnosis, our approach and its variations should be powerful in the separation and characterization of proteins following MP.

Characterization of wheat gliadin proteins by combined two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2859-65.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A proteomics-based approach was used for characterizing wheat gliadins from an Italian common wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivar. A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) map of roughly 40 spots was obtained by submitting the 70% alcohol-soluble crude protein extract to isoelectric focusing on immobilized pH gradient strips across two pH gradient ranges, i.e., 3-10 or pH 6-11, and to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis in the second dimension. The chymotryptic digest of each spot was characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and nano electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis, providing a "peptide map" for each digest. The measured masses were subsequently sought in databases for sequences. For accurate identification of the parent protein, it was necessary to determine de novo sequences by MS/MS experiments on the peptides. By partial mass fingerprinting, we identified protein molecules such as alpha/beta-, gamma-, omega-gliadin, and high molecular weight-glutenin. The single spots along the 2-DE map were discriminated on the basis of their amino acid sequence traits. alpha-Gliadin, the most represented wheat protein in databases, was highly conserved as the relative N-terminal sequence of the components from the 2-DE map contained only a few silent amino acid substitutions. The other closely related gliadins were identified by sequencing internal peptide chains. The results gave insight into the complex nature of gliadin heterogeneity. This approach has provided us with sound reference data for differentiating gliadins amongst wheat varieties.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2808-18.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Dietary isoflavones from soy are suggested to protect endothelial cells from damaging effects of endothelial stressors and thereby to prevent atherosclerosis. In search of the molecular targets of isoflavone action, we analyzed the effects of the major soy isoflavone, genistein, on changes in protein expression levels induced by the endothelial stressor homocysteine (Hcy) in EA.hy 926 endothelial cells. Proteins from cells exposed for 24 h to 25 microM Hcy alone or in combination with 2.5 microM genistein were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and those with altered spot intensities were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. Genistein reversed Hcy-induced changes of proteins involved in metabolism, detoxification, and gene regulation; and some of those effects can be linked functionally to the antiatherosclerotic properties of the soy isoflavone. Alterations of steady-state levels of cytoskeletal proteins by genistein suggested an effect on apoptosis. As a matter of fact genistein caused inhibition of Hcy-mediated apoptotic cell death as indicated by inhibition of DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. In conclusion, proteome analysis allows the rapid identification of cellular target proteins of genistein action in endothelial cells exposed to the endothelial stressor Hcy and therefore enables the identification of molecular pathways of its antiatherosclerotic action.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2748-60.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The options available for processing quantitative data from isotope coded affinity tag (ICAT) experiments have mostly been confined to software specific to the instrument of acquisition. However, recent developments with data format conversion have subsequently increased such processing opportunities. In the present study, data sets from ICAT experiments, analysed with liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), using an Applied Biosystems QSTAR Pulsar quadrupole-TOF mass spectrometer, were processed in triplicate using separate mass spectrometry software packages. The programs Pro ICAT, Spectrum Mill and SEQUEST with XPRESS were employed. Attention was paid towards the extent of common identification and agreement of quantitative results, with additional interest in the flexibility and productivity of these programs. The comparisons were made with data from the analysis of a specifically prepared test mixture, nine proteins at a range of relative concentration ratios from 0.1 to 10 (light to heavy labelled forms), as a known control, and data selected from an ICAT study involving the measurement of cytokine induced protein expression in human lymphoblasts, as an applied example. Dissimilarities were detected in peptide identification that reflected how the associated scoring parameters favoured information from the MS/MS data sets. Accordingly, there were differences in the numbers of peptides and protein identifications, although from these it was apparent that both confirmatory and complementary information was present. In the quantitative results from the three programs, no statistically significant differences were observed.

<ABSTRACT>
Phenobarbital (PB) induction of CYP2B, a representative target gene of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), has been observed to be attenuated in preneoplastic lesions of rat liver; however, molecular basis for this attenuation is poorly understood. In this report, we provide evidence indicating that the CAR expressed in the hepatic preneoplastic lesions of rats and mice was resistant to nuclear translocation and transactivation of the PB-responsive enhancer module upon PB treatment. These observations suggest that the attenuation of the induction of CYP2B by PB in hepatic preneoplastic lesions is evidently a consequence of impaired nuclear translocation of CAR.

<ABSTRACT>
The steroid/sterol sulfotransferase gene (SULT2B1) encodes for two isozymes of which one (SULT2B1b) sulfonates cholesterol and is selectively expressed in skin. The human SULT2B1 gene contains neither a TATAAA nor a CCAAT motif upstream of the coding region for SULT2B1b; however, this area is GC-rich. Of five Sp1 elements identified two had regulatory activity utilizing immortalized human keratinocytes: one element is located above the ostensible transcription initiation site, whereas the other is located within the 5'-untranslated region of the SULT2B1b mRNA. Sp1 and Sp2 transcription factors identified by supershift analyses induced reporter gene activity, an effect markedly augmented by histone deacetylase inhibition.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Close relationships have been demonstrated between adipose tissue and the inflammatory/immune system. Furthermore, obesity is increasingly considered as a state of chronic inflammation. Cytofluorometric analysis reveals the presence of significant levels of lymphocytes in the stroma-vascular fraction of white adipose tissues. In epididymal (EPI) fat, lymphocytes display an "ancestral" immune system phenotype (up to 70% of natural killer (NK), gammadelta+ T and NKT cells among all lymphocytes) whereas the inguinal (ING) immune system presents more adaptive characteristics (high levels of alphabeta+ T and B cells). The percentage of NK cells in EPI fat was decreased in obese mice fed with a high-fat diet, whereas gammadelta positive cells were significantly increased in ING fat. These data support the notion that adipose tissue may elaborate immunological mechanisms to regulate its functions which might be altered in obesity.

Proteomic analysis of redox- and ErbB2-dependent changes in mammary

two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2908-26.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Differential protein expression analysis based on modification of selected amino acids with labelling reagents has become the major method of choice for quantitative proteomics. One such methodology, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE), uses a matched set of fluorescent N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS) ester cyanine dyes to label lysine residues in different samples which can be run simultaneously on the same gels. Here we report the use of iodoacetylated cyanine (ICy) dyes (for labelling of cysteine thiols, for 2-D DIGE-based redox proteomics. Characterisation of ICy dye labelling in relation to its stoichiometry, sensitivity and specificity is described, as well as comparison of ICy dye with NHS-Cy dye labelling and several protein staining methods. We have optimised conditions for labelling of nonreduced, denatured samples and report increased sensitivity for a subset of thiol-containing proteins, allowing accurate monitoring of redox-dependent thiol modifications and expression changes. Cysteine labelling was then combined with lysine labelling in a multiplex 2-D DIGE proteomic study of redox-dependent and ErbB2-dependent changes in epithelial cells exposed to oxidative stress. This study identifies differentially modified proteins involved in cellular redox regulation, protein folding, proliferative suppression, glycolysis and cytoskeletal organisation, revealing the complexity of the response to oxidative stress and the impact that overexpression of ErbB2 has on this response.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3525-33.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In Xanthomonas campestris, the causative agent of black rot in crucifers, the endoglucanase level is greatly decreased in the mutant deficient in Clp, a homologue of cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP). It is established that Clp has the same DNA binding specificity as CRP at positions 5, 6, and 7 (GTG motif) of the DNA half site. In this study, the engA transcription initiation site was determined by the 5' RACE method, and two consensus Clp-binding sites, site I and site II centered at -69.5 and -42.5, respectively, were located. Transcriptional fusion assays indicated that Clp greatly activates engA transcription. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that position 5 of GTG motif in site II is essential for both DNA-protein complex formation in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and engA transcription in vivo. In addition, mutation at position 5 of site I drastically reduces the promoter activity, indicating that binding of Clp to site I exerts a synergistic effect on the transcription activation by site II. engA appears to be the first X. campestris gene known to be activated by Clp via a direct binding to the promoter.

TGFbeta mediates its cellular effects through types I and II cell surface receptors coupled to the nucleocytoplasmic Smad proteins. Wnt signals via binding to a cell surface receptor, Frizzled, which in turn activates intracellular Dishevelled, ultimately leading to stabilization and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. Previous studies have demonstrated several points of cross-talk between the TGFbeta and Wnt signaling pathways. In yeast two-hybrid and GST-pull down assays, Dishevelled-1 and Smad 3 have been shown to physically interact through the C-terminal one-half of Dishevelled-1 and the MH2 domain of Smad 3. The current study demonstrates that co-treatment of murine embryonic maxillary mesenchyme (MEMM) cells with Wnt-3a and TGFbeta leads to enhanced reporter activity from TOPflash, a Wnt-responsive reporter plasmid. Transcriptional cooperation between TGFbeta and Wnt did not require the presence of a Smad binding element, nor did it occur when a TGFbeta-responsive reporter plasmid (p3TP-lux) was transfected. Overexpression of Smad 3 further enhanced the cooperation between Wnt and TGFbeta while overexpression of dominant-negative Smads 2 and 3 inhibited this effect. Co-stimulation with TGFbeta led to greater nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, providing explanation for the effect of TGFbeta on Wnt-3a reporter activity. Wnt-3a exerted antiproliferative activity in MEMM cells, similar to that exerted by TGFbeta. In addition, Wnt-3a and TGFbeta in combination led to synergistic decreases in MEMM cell proliferation. These data demonstrate a functional interaction between the TGFbeta and Wnt signaling pathways and suggest that Wnt activation of the canonical pathway is an important mediator of MEMM cell growth.

The secondary electron acceptor of photosystem I in Gloeobacter violaceus

<ABSTRACT>
The secondary electron acceptor of photosystem (PS) I in the cyanobacterium Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421 was identified as menaquinone-4 (MQ-4) by comparing high performance liquid chromatograms and absorption spectra with an authentic compound. The MQ-4 content was estimated to be two molecules per one molecule of chlorophyll (Chl) a', a constituent of P700. Comparative genomic analyses showed that six of eight men genes, encoding phylloquinone/MQ biosynthetic enzymes, are missing from the G. violaceus genome. Since G. violaceus clearly synthesizes MQ-4, the combined results indicate that this cyanobacterium must have a novel pathway for the synthesis of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid.

<ABSTRACT>
Premature ageing, one of the characteristics of Down syndrome (DS), may involve oxidative stress and impairment of proteasome activity. Transgenic mice overexpressing the human copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene are one of the first murine models for DS and it has been shown that SOD1 overexpression might be either deleterious or beneficial. Here, we show a reduction in proteasome activities in the cortex of SOD1 transgenic mice and an associated increase in the content of oxidized SOD1 protein. As we demonstrate that in vitro oxidized SOD can inhibit purified proteasome peptidase activities, modified SOD1 might be partially responsible for proteasome inhibition shown in SOD1 transgenic mice.

<ABSTRACT>
Hyperproliferation of the premalignant epithelium is critical for colonic carcinogenesis; however the mechanisms remain largely unexplored. We report herein that prior to occurrence of neoplastic lesions in the azoxymethane-rat model of colon carcinogenesis; the tumor suppressor gene C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) was down-regulated with a concomitant increase in Src activity. Furthermore, pharmacological or genetic (RNA interference) inhibition of Csk resulted in increased proliferation in colon cancer cell lines through the mitogen-activated protein kinase dependent pathway. Thus, we demonstrate, for the first time, that Csk suppression is an important early event in colorectal cancer pathogenesis.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The dgd1 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana provides us with a powerful tool for revealing the specific role of digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) in photosynthesis. Blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that photosystem I (PSI) subunits are assembled into a PSI complex, and that a PSI subcomplex lacking stroma side subunits was also present. PSI subunits in the dgd1 mutant were decreased to a similar level compared with that in the wild type (WT) Arabidopsis. Further experiments showed that PSI subunits in the stroma side, PsaD and PsaE, in the dgd1 mutant were more susceptible to removal by chaotropic agents than those in the WT plant, indicating that the stability of PsaD and PsaE is impaired in the dgd1 mutant. These results provide evidence that DGDG is important for the stability of the PSI complex.

Expression of pro-apoptotic Bfk isoforms reduces during malignant
transformation in the human gastrointestinal tract.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Reduced expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins has been described in many gastrointestinal cancers, and may play a role in tumourigenesis. The human homologue of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, Bfk, is predominantly expressed in tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. In colon, four alternatively spliced isoforms were identified; of which two are pro-apoptotic when overexpressed. In the transition from normal tissue to tumour, pro-apoptotic Bfk isoform expression is substantially reduced in up to 80% of tumours isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract (8/10 colonic tumours and 26/37 of all gastrointestinal tumours) compared to 3/117 tumours from outside the gastrointestinal tract. These data suggest that pro-apoptotic isoforms of Bfk may help to protect against the development of human gastrointestinal malignancy.

Role of the PDK1-PKB-GSK3 pathway in regulating glycogen synthase and
glucose uptake in the heart.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3632-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In order to investigate the importance of the PDK1-PKB-GSK3 signalling network in regulating glycogen synthase (GS) in the heart, we have employed tissue specific conditional knockout mice lacking PDK1 in muscle (mPDK1-/-), as well as knockin mice in which the protein kinase B (PKB) phosphorylation site on glycogen synthase kinase-3alpha (GSK3alpha) (Ser21) and GSK3beta (Ser9) is changed to Ala. We demonstrate that in hearts from mPDK1-/- or double GSK3alpha/GSK3beta knockin mice, insulin failed to stimulate the activity of GS or induce its dephosphorylation at residues that are phosphorylated by GSK3. We also establish that in the heart, both GSK3 isoforms participate in the regulation of GS, with GSK3beta playing a more prominent role. This contrasts with skeletal muscle where GSK3beta is the major regulator of insulin-induced GS activity. Despite the inability of insulin to stimulate glycogen synthesis in hearts from the mPDK1-/- or double GSK3alpha/GSK3beta knockin mice, these animals possessed normal levels of cardiac glycogen, demonstrating that total glycogen levels are regulated independently of insulin's ability to stimulate GS in the heart and that mechanisms such as allosteric activation of GS by glucose-6-phosphate and/or activation of GS by muscle contraction, could operate to maintain normal glycogen levels in these mice. We also demonstrate that in cardiomyocytes derived from the mPDK1-/- hearts, although the levels of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) are increased 2-fold, insulin failed to stimulate glucose uptake, providing genetic evidence that PDK1 plays a crucial role in enabling insulin to promote glucose uptake in cardiac muscle.

<ABSTRACT>
Phox and Bem1 (PB1) domains mediate protein-protein interactions via the formation of homo- or hetero-dimers. The C-terminal PB1 domain of yeast cell division cycle 24 (CDC24p), a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor involved in cell polarity establishment, is known to interact with the PB1 domain occurring in bud emergence MSB1 interacting 1 (BEM1p) during the regulation of the yeast budding process via its OPR/PC/AID (OPCA) motif. Here, we present the structure of an N-terminally truncated version of the Sc CDC24p PB1 domain. It shows a different topology of the beta-sheet than the long form. However, the C-terminal part of the structure shows the conserved PB1 domain features including the OPCA motif with a slight rearrangement of helix alpha1. Residues which are important for the heterodimerization with BEM1p are structurally preserved.

<ABSTRACT>
Phycobilisomes are protein complexes that harvest light and transfer energy to the photo system. Here, the three dimensional structure of intact phycobilisomes from Nostoc flagelliforme is studied by a combination of negative stain electron microscopy and cryo-electron microscopy. Results show that the intact phycobilisomes are composed of a tricylindrical core and six rods. Each allophycocyanin cylinder presents a double-layered structure when viewed from the side and a triangular shape when viewed from the top. These characteristics indicate that allophycocyanin trimers in the intact phycobilisomes are arranged into hexameric oligomers in a parallel manner.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3547-54.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Basic-leucine zipper transcription factors of the Maf family are key regulators of various developmental and differentiation processes. We previously reported that the phosphorylation status of MafA is a critical determinant of its biological functions. Using Western blot and mass spectrometry analysis, we now show that MafA is phosphorylated by p38 MAP kinase and identify three phosphoacceptor sites: threonine 113 and threonine 57, evolutionarily conserved residues located in the transcription activating domain, and serine 272. Mutation of these residues severely impaired MafA biological activity. Furthermore, we show that p38 also phosphorylates MafB and c-Maf. Together, these findings suggest that the p38 MAP kinase pathway is a novel regulator of large Maf transcription factors.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The growth hormone (GH)-responsive cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C11 is down-regulated in vitamin A-deficient (VAD) rat liver. This study assessed the impact of a VAD diet on the hepatic Janus kinase-Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (JAK-STAT) system that mediates GH signalling. Nuclear tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylated STAT5 accumulated in VAD liver, whereas nuclear JAK2 tyrosine kinase and SHP-1 phosphatase were decreased. Tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP-1 was decreased to 36+/-14% of control (P<0.01), indicating its impaired activation in VAD liver. Episodic GH pulses increased nuclear phospho-STAT5, especially in control liver, but nuclear phospho-JAK2 and phospho-SHP-1 were not restored. CYP2C11 protein and testosterone 16alpha-hydroxylation were decreased in VAD liver to 67+/-16% and 76+/-19% of control, and were further decreased by GH to 32+/-8% and 30+/-14% of control. Thus, hypo-responsiveness of JAK-STAT in VAD liver is associated with impaired nuclear phospho-STAT dephosphorylation.

<ABSTRACT>
Wilson disease is a disorder of copper metabolism, due to inherited mutations in the Wilson copper ATPase gene ATP7B. To purify and study the function of the ATPase, the enzyme was truncated by five of the six metal binding domains and endowed with an N-terminal histidine-tag for affinity purification. This construct, delta1-5WNDP, was able to functionally complement a yeast strain defective in its native copper ATPase CCC2. Delta1-5WNDP was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. This allowed, for the first time, the functional study of the Wilson ATPase in a purified, reconstituted system.

The p53 pathway is synergized by p38 MAPK signaling to mediate

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The phytochemical 11,11'-dideoxyverticillin, derived from the fungus Shiraia bambusicola, has been shown to possess potent anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. Here, we investigated the effect of 11,11'-dideoxyverticillin on cell cycle progression, and explored the potential mechanisms for this effect. A concentration- and time-dependent cell cycle blockade at G2/M phase was observed in human colon cancer cells (HCT-116) following 11,11'-dideoxyverticillin treatment and was associated with marked increases in levels of p53, phospho-p53(ser20) and phospho-Chk2(Thr 68). When wild type p53 expression was specifically inhibited by RNA interference, HCT-116 cells treated with 11,11'-dideoxyverticillin failed to arrest in G2/M and did not show increased phospho-Chk2(Thr 68). On the other hand, 11,11'-dideoxyverticillin treatment also elicited p38 MAP kinase activity and expression of phospho-p38 MAPK. Treatment with a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) successfully inhibited p38 MAPK and delayed the onset of G2/M arrest induced by 0.5 microM 11,11'-dideoxyverticillin after approximately 6 h, but did not abolish the induction of G2/M arrest. Additionally, SB203580 did not alter the levels of p53, phospho-p53 (ser20), or phospho-Chk2 (Thr68) proteins in 11,11'-dideoxyverticillin-treated cells. Together, these findings indicate that p53-mediated phosphorylation of Chk2 maybe plays a vital role in 11,11'-dideoxyverticillin-induced G2/M arrest, and that p38 MAPK might accelerate this progression. Our work suggests a new possibility of interactions among p53, Chk2 and p38 MAPK signaling in G2/M arrest.

<ABSTRACT>
One of the distinctive and mysterious features of mammalian aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) is the existence of stable high-molecular weight complexes containing 10 out of 20 AARSs. The composition and structure of these complexes are conserved among multicellular animals. No specific function associated with these structures has been found, and there is no evident rationale for a particular separation of AARSs in "complex-bound" and "free" forms. We have demonstrated a strong association between the occurrence of AARSs in the complexes and the volume of their substrate amino acids. The significance of this association is discussed in terms of the structural organization of translation in the living cell.

<ABSTRACT>
Bacillus thuringiensis subs israelensis produces Cry toxins active against mosquitoes. Receptor binding is a key determinant for specificity of Cry toxins composed of three domains. We found that exposed loop alpha-8 of Cry11Aa toxin, located in domain II, is an important epitope involved in receptor interaction. Synthetic peptides corresponding to exposed regions in domain II (loop alpha-8, beta-4 and loop 3) competed binding of Cry11Aa to membrane vesicles from Aedes aegypti midgut microvilli. The role of loop alpha-8 of Cry11A in receptor interaction was demonstrated by phage display and site-directed mutagenesis. We isolated a peptide-displaying phage (P5.tox), that recognizes loop alpha-8 in Cry11Aa, interferes interaction with the midgut receptor and attenuates toxicity in bioassay. Loop alpha-8 mutants affected in toxicity and receptor binding were characterized.

<ABSTRACT>
Plastocyanin and cytochrome c6 are two small soluble electron carriers located in the intrathylacoidal space of cyanobacteria. Although their role as electron shuttle between the cytochrome b6f and photosystem I complexes in the photosynthetic pathway is well established, their participation in the respiratory electron transport chain as donors to the terminal oxidase is still under debate. Here, we present the first time-resolved analysis showing that both cytochrome c6 and plastocyanin can be efficiently oxidized by the aa3 type cytochrome c oxidase in Nostoc sp. PCC 7119. The apparent electron transfer rate constants are ca. 250 and 300 s(-1) for cytochrome c6 and plastocyanin, respectively. These constants are 10 times higher than those obtained for the oxidation of horse cytochrome c by the oxidase, in spite of being a reaction thermodynamically more favourable.

<ABSTRACT>
Microtubules are polymers of alpha/beta-tubulin participating in essential cell functions. A multistep process involving distinct molecular chaperones and cofactors produces new tubulin heterodimers competent to polymerise. In vitro cofactor A (TBCA) interacts with beta-tubulin in a quasi-native state behaving as a molecular chaperone. We have used siRNA to silence TBCA expression in HeLa and MCF-7 mammalian cell lines. TBCA is essential for cell viability and its knockdown produces a decrease in the amount of soluble tubulin, modifications in microtubules and G1 cell cycle arrest. In MCF-7 cells, cell death was preceded by a change in cell shape resembling differentiation.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3596-600.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) is a serum glycoprotein that mainly binds basic drugs. Previous reports have shown that AGP converts from a beta-sheet to an alpha-helix upon interaction with biomembranes. In the current studies, we found that alkanols, diols, and halogenols all induce this conformational change. Increased length and bulkiness of the hydrocarbon group and the presence of a halogen atom promoted this conversion, whereas the presence of a hydroxyl group inhibited it. Moreover, the effect was dependent on the hydrophobic and electrostatic properties of the alcohols. These results indicate that, in a membrane environment, hydrophobic and electrostatic factors cooperatively induce the transition of AGP from a beta-sheet to an alpha-helix.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The viroporin activity of the E protein from murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the coronaviruses, was analyzed. Viroporins are a growing family of viral proteins able to enhance membrane permeability, promoting virus budding. Initially, the MHV E gene was inducibly expressed in Escherichia coli cells, leading to the arrest of bacterial growth, cell lysis and permeabilization to different compounds. Thus, exit of labeled nucleotides from E. coli cells to the cytoplasm was apparent upon expression of MHV E. In addition, enhanced entry of the antibiotic hygromycin B occurred at levels comparable to those observed with the viroporin 6K from Sindbis virus. Mammalian cells are also readily permeabilized by the expression of MHV E protein. Finally, brefeldin A powerfully blocks the viroporin activity of the E protein in BHK cells, suggesting that an intact vesicular system is necessary for this coronavirus to permeabilize mammalian cells.

TNF-alpha enhances phenotypic and functional maturation of human epidermal

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3660-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Dendritic cells (DC) play a central role in immunity/tolerance decision, depending on their activation/maturation state. TNF-alpha is largely produced in the skin under inflammatory conditions. However, it still remains to be defined how TNF-alpha modulates the activation status of human LC, the most specialized DC controlling skin immunity. Here, we reported that fresh immature LC, highly purified from healthy human skin and exposed for two days to TNF-alpha under serum-free conditions, expressed up-regulated level of co-stimulatory molecules (CD40, CD54, CD86), maturation markers (CD83, DC-LAMP), CCR7 lymph node homing receptor, and down-regulated Langerin level, in a dose-dependent manner. This mature phenotype is closely associated with enhanced LC allostimulatory capacity. Furthermore, TNF-alpha significantly increased the number of viable LC and decreased their spontaneous apoptosis. More importantly, TNF-alpha induced LC to produce both IFN-gamma-inducible-protein IP-10/CXCL10, a Th1-attracting chemokine and IL-12 p40. Bioactive IL-12 p70 was never detected, even after additional CD40 stimulus. The results implicate LC as an effective target through which TNF-alpha may up- or down-regulate the inflammatory skin reactions.

<ABSTRACT>
Human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs) exposed to subcytotoxic stress display many features of senescence. Using differential display RT-PCR, gene expression of HDFs in premature senescence induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide or ethanol and in replicative senescence was compared to gene expression of HDFs at early cumulative population doublings. Thirty genes of known function were identified from the 265 differentially displayed cDNA fragments. A customized low-density array allowed to confirm the relative level of the corresponding 30 transcripts. We found differential expression of genes coding for proteins implicated namely in growth arrest (PTEN, IGFBP-3, LRP-1 and CAV1), senescent morphogenesis (TGF-beta1 and LOXL2) and iron metabolism (TFR and FTL).

<ABSTRACT>
To investigate the importance of the seventh residue of the second and third repeat fragments (R2 and R3 peptides) of the microtubule-binding domain (MBD) for tau filamentous assembly, the residues Lys and Pro were substituted (R2-K7P and R3-P7K). The filament formations of the R2 and R3 peptides were almost lost due to their substitutions despite their overall conformational similarities. The NOE analyses showed the importance of the conformational flexibility for the R2 peptide and the coupled extended and helical conformations for the R3 peptide in their limited N-terminal regions around their seventh residues. The result shows that the filament formation of MBD is initiated from a short fragment region containing the minimal conformational or functional motif.

Redox control of disulfide-bond formation in the H+-pyrophosphatase of Streptomyces coelicolor was investigated using cysteine mutants expressed in Escherichia coli. The wild-type enzyme, but not a cysteine-less mutant, was reversibly inactivated by oxidation. To determine the residues involved in oxidative inactivation, different cysteine residues were replaced. Analysis with a cysteine-modifying reagent revealed that the formation of a disulfide bond between cysteines 253 and 621 was responsible for enzyme inactivation. This result suggests that residues in different cytoplasmic loops are close to each other in the tertiary structure. Both cysteine residues are conserved in K+-independent (type II) H+-pyrophosphatases.

Biomineralization in diatoms: characterization of novel polyamines
associated with silica.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3765-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Pattern formation during silica biomineralization in diatoms appears to depend on long-chain polyamines as well as proteins covalently modified with polyamines (silaffins). Recently, the complete genome of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana has been sequenced making this species an attractive model organism for future studies on biomineralization. Mass- and NMR-spectroscopic analysis of the long-chain polyamines from this diatom species reveals the existence of a complex population with as yet unknown structural features. These include complex methylation patterns, different attachment moieties as well as the existence of quaternary ammonium functionalities.

Quorum quenching enzyme activity is widely conserved in the sera of
mammalian species.

<ABSTRACT>
Acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing signals play a key role in synchronizing virulence gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which could cause fatal bloodstream infections. We showed that AHL inactivation activity, albeit with variable efficiency, was conserved in the serum samples of all the 6 tested mammalian animals. High-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that mammalian sera had a lactonase-like enzyme(s), which hydrolyzed the lactone ring of AHL to produce acyl homoserine, with enzyme properties reminiscent of paraoxonases (PONs). We further showed that the animal cell lines expressing three mouse PON genes, respectively, displayed strong AHL degradation activities.

The properties of the mitochondrial megachannel in mitoplasts from human
colon carcinoma cells are not influenced by Bax.

<ABSTRACT>
This paper explores the relationship between Bax and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). Isolated human colon tumor (HCT116) Bax- mitochondria exposed to recombinant Bax exhibited a slow, cyclosporin A-sensitive swelling, but only at [Bax]>200 nM. The amount of Bax incorporated was much higher than that found in organelles isolated from HCT116 Bax+ staurosporine- or etoposide-treated apoptotic cells, casting doubts on the significance of the putative PT induction for apoptosis. Bax did not influence the electrophysiological properties of an approximately 1 nS channel ascribed to the Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition pore. These observations indicate that the PTP is independent of Bax.

Charge substitution shows that repulsive electrostatic interactions impede
the oligomerization of Alzheimer amyloid peptides.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3574-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The strong pH dependence of A beta oligomerization could arise from favorable intermolecular charge-charge interactions between His and carboxylate groups, or, alternatively, by mutual electrostatic repulsion of peptide molecules. To test between these two possibilities, the pH dependence of the oligomerization of A beta and three charge substitution variants with Asp, Glu and His substituted by Ala is measured. All four peptides oligomerize, as detected by thioflavin T fluorescence, turbidity, and amyloid fibril formation; therefore, specific charge-charge interactions are nonessential for oligomerization. The strong negative correlation between net charge and oligomerization indicates that electrostatic repulsion between A beta monomers impedes their association.

A quantitative investigation into the losses of proteins at different
stages of a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis procedure.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2739-47.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We report the results of a systematic investigation to quantify the losses of protein during a well-established two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) procedure. Radioactively labelled proteins ([(14)C]bovine serum albumin and a homogenate prepared from the liver of a rat that had been injected with [(35)S]methionine) were used, and recovery was quantified by digesting pieces of gel in H(2)O(2) and subjecting the digests to liquid scintillation counting. When samples were loaded onto the first dimension immobilised pH gradient strips by in-gel rehydration, recovery of protein from the strips was 44-80% of the amount of protein loaded, depending on the amount of protein in the sample. Most of the unrecovered protein appeared to have adhered to the reswelling tray. Losses during isoelectric focusing (IEF) were much smaller (7-14%), although approximately 2% of the protein appeared to migrate from sample strips to adjacent blank strips in the focussing apparatus. A further 17-24% of the proteins were lost into the buffers during equilibration prior to running in the second dimension. Losses during the second dimension run and subsequent staining with SYPRO Ruby amounted to less than 10%. The overall loss during 2-DE was reduced by approximately 25% when proteins were loaded onto the IEF strips using sample cups instead of by in-gel rehydration. These extensive and variable losses during the 2-DE procedure mean that spot intensities on 2-DE gels cannot be used to derive reliable, quantitative information on the amounts of proteins present in the original sample.

Oxidation of carboxyamidomethyl cysteine may add complexity to protein
identification.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2761-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Protein identification by interrogation of databases requires a comprehensive compilation of modified amino acids forms. Here, we describe the chemical oxidation of carboxyamidomethyl cysteine to the sulfoxide and sulfone forms, species that may add more complexity to peptide analyses. They can be easily distinguished by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) due to their characteristic pattern of side chain neutral eliminations either from the parent ion or ion series that generate dehydroalanine as detected by MS(3). This finding was supported by the MS(n) spectra recorded for a peptide isolated from a mixture of tryptic peptides and for a derivatized/oxidized synthetic peptide with a different sequence. These modifications and their diagnostic neutral losses should be included in the list of chemical modifications and in algorithms designed for the automatic sequencing of peptides and database searching.

<ABSTRACT>
Arabidopsis thaliana contains three genes with high homology to potato p24 which was described as a member of the Whirly family of nuclear transcriptional activators. Computer-based analysis revealed that all Arabidopsis Whirly (Why) proteins contain targeting sequences for either plastids or mitochondria. The functionality of these sequences was demonstrated by in vitro import assays into isolated organelles. Transient expression of GFP fusion proteins in protoplasts and onion epidermal cells confirmed the localisation of these proteins in plastids or mitochondria, respectively. The possession of organellar targeting sequences seems to be conserved among Why proteins of higher plant species, including potato p24.

Facilitated release of substrate protein from prefoldin by chaperonin.

<ABSTRACT>
Prefoldin is a chaperone that captures a protein-folding intermediate and transfers it to the group II chaperonin for correct folding. However, kinetics of interactions between prefoldin and substrate proteins have not been investigated. In this study, dissociation constants and dissociation rate constants of unfolded proteins with prefoldin were firstly measured using fluorescence microscopy. Our results suggest that binding and release of prefoldin from hyperthermophilic archaea with substrate proteins were in a dynamic equilibrium. Interestingly, the release of substrate proteins from prefoldin was facilitated when chaperonin was present, supporting a handoff mechanism of substrate proteins from prefoldin to the chaperonin.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
LRRC4, a novel member of LRR superfamily thought to be involved in development and tumorigenesis of the nervous tissue, has the potential to suppress tumorigenesis and cell proliferation of U251MG cells. This study aimed at revealing the correlation between expression of LRRC4 and the maintenance of normal function and tumorigenesis suppression within the central nervous system. We systematically analyzed the expression and tissue distributions of the gene in tissues. Results showed that LRRC4 expression was limited to normal adult brain, both in human and in mouse, and exhibited a development-regulated pattern, but was down-regulated in brain tumor tissues and U251MG cell line. Furthermore, dynamic alterations in gene expression associated with cell cycle progression were investigated by using Tet-on system. Results showed that LRRC4 induced a cell cycle delay at the late G1 phase, probably through the alteration of the expression of different cell cycle regulating proteins responsible for mediating G1-S progression, such as p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1), Cdk2 and PCNA, p-ERK1/2. These findings suggest that LRRC4 may play an important role in maintaining normal function and suppressing tumorigenesis in the central nervous system.

Quinolinate synthetase, an iron-sulfur enzyme in NAD biosynthesis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3737-43.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) plays a crucial role as a cofactor in numerous essential redox biological reactions. NAD derives from quinolinic acid which is synthesized in Escherichia coli from L-aspartate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) as the result of the concerted action of two enzymes, L-aspartate oxidase (NadB) and quinolinate synthetase (NadA). We report here the characterization of NadA protein from E. coli. When anaerobically purified, the isolated soluble protein contains 3-3.5 iron and 3-3.5 sulfide/polypeptide chain. Mossbauer spectra of the 57Fe-protein revealed that the majority of the iron is in the form of a (4Fe-4S)2+ cluster. An enzymatic assay for quinolinate synthetase activity was set up and allowed to demonstrate that the cluster is absolutely required for NadA activity. Exposure to air leads to degradation of the cluster and inactivate enzyme.

Induction of 15-lipoxygenase-1 impairs expression of HIV-1 receptors CD4

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3691-4.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The lipoxygenase pathway of immunocompetent cells has been related to HIV infection and interleukins-4 and -13 have been described as major regulators of this metabolic route. To explore whether 15-lipoxygenase1 expression might impact the responsiveness of monocytic cells for HIV we induced expression of this enzyme by two independent ways (stable transfection of U937 cells and culturing of blood monocytes in vitro in the presence of granulocyte/monocyte colony stimulating factor and interleukin 4) and assayed the cellular content of the two HIV-1 receptors CD4 and CXCR4 (CD184) by real time RT-PCR and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Wild-type U937 cells express CD4 and CXCR4 at high levels and expression was not altered when the cells were transfected with control plasmids. In contrast, expression of these proteins was strongly reduced when the cells were stably transfected with 15-lipoxygenase1. Similar effects were observed when blood monocytes were cultured in the presence of granulocyte/monocyte colony stimulating factor and interleukin-4. Under these conditions strong overexpression of 15-lipoxygenase1 was paralleled by downregulation of CD4 and CXCR4. Since these surface proteins are essential for the binding of T-tropic HIV-1 strains expression of 15-lipoxygenase1 may confer resistance against HIV infection to monocytic cells.

Downregulation of Ski and SnoN co-repressors by anisomycin.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3701-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteasome pathway regulates TGF-beta signaling; degradation of activated Smad2/3 and receptors turns TGF-beta signal off, while degradation of negative modulators such as Ski and SnoN maintains the signal. We have found that anisomycin is able to downregulate Ski and SnoN via proteasome as TGF-beta does, but through a mechanism independent of Smad activation. The mechanism used by anisomycin to downregulate Ski and SnoN is also independent of MAPK activation and protein synthesis inhibition. TGF-beta signal was the only pathway described causing Ski and SnoN degradation, thus this new effect of anisomycin on endogenous Ski and SnoN proteins suggests alternative processes to downregulate these negative modulators of TGF-beta signaling.

Subsequent to our earlier report on the first purification of antiquitin protein from seabream liver and demonstration of its enzymatic activity [FEBS Letters 516 (2002) 183-186], we report herein the cloning of its full-length cDNA sequence. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 511 amino acids. Results of RT-PCR indicate that antiquitin is highly expressed in both the seabream liver and kidney. Transfection studies in cultured eukaryotic cells provided further evidence that it is a cytosolic protein. Bacterial expression of the enzyme was also performed. The purified recombinant protein was demonstrated to exhibit similar kinetic properties as the native enzyme.

<ABSTRACT>
The effect on the stability of alternative transcripts of different mutations of the NDUFS4 gene in patients with Leigh syndrome with complex I deficiency is presented. Normally, two NDUFS4 splice variants are degraded by nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) while a third form does not trigger NMD degradation. In a patient with a premature termination codon in exon 1, all the three splice variants are up-regulated. The present is the first case of a nonsense mutation leading to the abrogation of NMD, which can represent an additional event to be considered in the evaluation of clinically relevant mutations.

An archaeal SET domain protein exhibits distinct lysine methyltransferase
activity towards DNA-associated protein MC1-alpha.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3859-65.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The evolutionarily conserved SET domain proteins in eukaryotes have been shown to function as site-specific histone lysine methyltransferases, and play an important role in regulating chromatin-mediated gene transcriptional activation and silencing. Structure-based sequence analysis has revealed that SET domains are also encoded by viruses and bacteria, as well as Archaea. However, their cellular functions remain elusive. In this study, we have characterized a SET domain protein from Methanosarcina mazei strain Go1 that we refer to as Go1-SET. We show that Go1-SET exists as a homodimer in solution, and functions as a lysine methyltransferase with high substrate specificity that is dependent on the amino acid sequence flanking the lysine methylation site. Particularly, Go1-SET exhibits selective methyltransferase activity towards one of the major archaeal DNA interacting protein MC1-alpha at lysine 37. Our findings suggest that SET domain proteins such as Go1-SET may restructure archaeal chromatin that is composed of MC1-DNA complexes, and that modulation of chromatin structure by lysine methylation may have arisen before the divergence of the archaeal and eukaryotic lineages.

Identification of human fetal liver miRNAs by a novel method.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3849-54.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short 20-25 nucleotides RNA molecules that have been shown to regulate gene expressions in a variety of eukaryotic systems. miRNAs are widespread in eukaryotes and several hundred of miRNAs have been identified, but still a lot of miRNAs have not been detected in various eukaryotic organisms. However, it is not an easy work to clone miRNAs by traditional methods. Here, we describe the identification of 27 miRNAs from a human fetal liver cDNA library by a novel cloning method. Low molecular weight RNA fraction (< or = 200 nt) from fetal liver tissue was extracted, and polyadenylated by poly(A) polymerase. A 5' RNA adaptor was ligated to poly(A)-tailed RNA using T4 RNA ligase. After reverse transcription, the cDNA was amplified by PCR with two adaptor primers. The PCR product with a size about 109 bp was recovered and cloned into T vector. After sequencing, database searching, and expression profiling, 5 novel miRNAs were discovered among other 22 known miRNAs in human fetal liver. These finding indicate that a large diverse population of miRNAs may function to regulate gene expression in hepatocyte.

heat shock transcription factor in response to heat/cold stress.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) mediates the induction of heat shock proteins in response to various types of stress. Although HSF1 activity is regulated by its post-translational modifications, alterations in mRNA expression have also been suggested. We here identified three new alternatively spliced isoforms of Drosophila HSF (dHSF) mRNA, named dHSFb, dHSFc, and dHSFd. We found that the ratio of dHSFb increases upon heat exposure, while that of dHSFd increases upon cold exposure. The dHSFc and dHSFd isoforms showed greater transcriptional activity than the other isoforms. Our findings suggest that alternative splicing regulates the transcriptional activity of dHSF.

<ABSTRACT>
The YukD protein in Bacillus subtilis was identified in a hidden Markov model (HMM) search as being related in sequence to ubiquitin. By solving the crystal structure we show that YukD adopts a fold that is most closely related to ubiquitin, yet has the shortest C-terminal tail of all known ubiquitin-like proteins. The endogenous gene of yukD in B. subtilis was disrupted without an obvious phenotypic effect and an inducible copy encoding a C-Myc and His-tagged version of the protein was introduced at the ectopic locus amyE. Conjugation assays performed both in vitro and in vivo indicate that YukD lacks the capacity for covalent bond formation with other proteins.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta as a molecular target to

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3829-36.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
It has been assumed that prostaglandin (PG)I2 signaling contributes to the negative growth control of lung cancer cells; however, the mechanism remains unresolved. PGI2 functions through a cell surface G protein-coupled receptor (prostaglandin I2-binding receptor, IP) and also exerts an effect by interacting with a nuclear hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta). We found that PPARdelta was a key molecule of PGI2 signaling to give negative growth control of lung cancer cells (A549), using carbarprostacyclin, a PGI2 agonist for IP and PPARdelta, and L-165041, a PPARdelta agonist. Furthermore, PPARdelta-induced cell growth control was reinforced by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase. These results suggest that PPARdelta activation under the suppression of PG synthesis is important to regulate lung cancer cell growth.

<ABSTRACT>
The origin of nitric oxide (*NO) in plants is unclear and an *NO synthase (NOS)-like enzyme and nitrate reductase (NR) are claimed as potential sources. Here we used wild-type and NR-defective double mutant plants to investigate *NO production in Arabidopsis thaliana in response to Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola. NOS activity increased substantially in leaves inoculated with P. syringae. However, electron paramagnetic resonance experiments showed a much higher *NO formation that was dependent on nitrite and mitochondrial electron transport rather than on arginine or nitrate. Overall, these results indicate that NOS, NR and a mitochondrial-dependent nitrite-reducing activity cooperate to produce *NO during A. thaliana-P. syringae interaction.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In a paradigmatic approach we identified cross-reactive plant allergens for allergy diagnosis and treatment by screening of a tobacco leaf complementary DNA (cDNA) library with serum IgE from a polysensitized allergic patient. Two IgE-reactive cDNA clones were isolated which code for proteins with significant sequence similarity to the actin-binding protein, villin. Northern- and Western-blotting demonstrate expression of the villin-related allergens in pollen and somatic plant tissues. In addition, villin-related proteins were detected in several plant allergen sources (tree-, grass-, weed pollen, fruits, vegetables, nuts). A recombinant C-terminal fragment of the villin-related protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and shown to react specifically with allergic patients IgE. After profilin, villin-related proteins represent another family of cytoskeletal proteins, which has been identified as cross-reactive plant allergens. They may be used for the diagnosis and treatment of patients suffering from multivalent plant allergies.

<ABSTRACT>
Although flavodoxin I is indispensable for Escherichia coli growth, the exact pathway(s) where flavodoxin I is essential has not been identified. We performed transposon mutagenesis of the flavodoxin I gene, fldA, in an E. coli strain that expressed mevalonate pathway enzymes and that had a point mutation in the lytB gene of the MEP pathway resulting in the accumulation of (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP). Disruption of fldA abrogated mevalonate-independent growth and dramatically decreased HMBPP levels. The fldA- mutant grew with mevalonate indicating that the essential role of flavodoxin I under aerobic conditions is in the MEP pathway. Growth was restored by fldA complementation. Since GcpE (which synthesizes HMBPP) and LytB are iron-sulfur enzymes that require a reducing system for their activity, we propose that flavodoxin is essential for GcpE and possibly LytB activity. Thus, the essential role for flavodoxin I in E. coli is in the MEP pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis.

Drosophila RET contains an active tyrosine kinase and elicits neurotrophic
activities in mammalian cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3789-96.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The RET receptor tyrosine kinase controls kidney organogenesis and development of subpopulations of enteric and sensory neurons in different vertebrate species, including humans, rodents, chicken and zebrafish. RET is activated by binding to a ligand complex formed by a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of neurotrophic factors bound to its cognate GFRalpha GPI-linked co-receptor. Despite the absence of GDNF or GFRalpha molecules in the Drosophila genome, a RET orthologue (dRET) has recently been described in this organism and shown to be expressed in subpopulations of cells of the excretory, digestive and nervous systems, thus resembling the expression pattern of RET in vertebrates. In this study, we report on the initial biochemical and functional characterization of the dRET protein in cell culture systems. Full-length dRET could be produced in mammalian and insect cells. Similar to its human counterpart (hRET), overexpression of dRET resulted in its ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that it bears an active tyrosine kinase. Unlike hRET, however, the extracellular domain of dRET was unable to interact with mammalian GDNF and GFRalpha1. Self association between dRET molecules could neither be detected, indicating that dRET is incapable of mediating cell adhesion by homophilic interactions. A chimeric molecule comprising the extracellular domain of hRET and the kinase domain of dRET was constructed and used to probe ligand-mediated downstream activities of the dRET kinase in PC12 cells. GDNF stimulation of cells transfected with the hRET/dRET chimera resulted in neurite outgrowth comparable to that obtained after transfection of wild-type hRET. These results indicate significant conservation between the biological effects elicited by the human and Drosophila RET kinases, and suggest functions for dRET in neuronal differentiation in the fly.

<ABSTRACT>
The presence of ionotropic P2X(7) receptor has been studied in mice brain from wild type and P2X(7) receptor knockout animals. Western blot and immunocytochemical assays show the presence of a protein containing the P2X(7) immunogenic epitopes in the brain of knockout model. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction experiments demonstrate the absence of the disrupted sequence, but other sequences of P2X(7) specific mRNA expression have been detected. Functional calcium imaging experiments in cultured granule neurons from P2X(7) knockout cerebella show the existence of a functional P2X(7)-like receptor that keeps some of the properties of the genuine receptor.

<ABSTRACT>
Small heat shock proteins prevent abnormal protein folding and accumulation. We analyzed the expression of hsp27 and alphaB-crystallin in skeletal muscle specimens of patients with desminopathies, plectinopathies, myotilinopathy, and other myofibrillar myopathies by means of differential centrifugation, 2D-gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and mass spectrometry. Hsp27-P82 and -P15 as well as alphaB-crystallin-P59 and -P45 are the major serine phosphorylation isoforms in normal and diseased human skeletal muscle. 2D-gel-electrophoresis revealed spots of hsp27 in a range of pH 5.3-6.4 in samples of all skeletal muscle specimens, except for the seven desminopathies. They indicated a shift of the main hsp27-spot to alkaline pH degrees, which may help to differentiate primary desminopathies from other myopathies with structural pathology of the desmin cytoskeleton.

Ceramide-1-phosphate promotes cell survival through activation of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3744-50.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In this report, we show for the first time that ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) stimulates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway, which is a major mechanism whereby growth factors promote cell survival. Also, C1P induced IkappaB phosphorylation, and enhanced the DNA binding activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Apoptotic macrophages showed a marked reduction of Bcl-X(L) levels, and this was prevented by C1P. These findings suggest that C1P blocks apoptosis, at least in part, by stimulating the PI3-K/PKB/NF-kappaB pathway and maintaining the production of antiapoptotic Bcl-X(L). Based on these and our previous observations, we propose a working model for C1P in which inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase and the subsequent decrease in ceramide levels would allow cell signaling through stimulation of the PI3-K/PKB pathway to promote cell survival.

Functional characterization of neostatins, the MMP-derived, enzymatic
cleavage products of type XVIII collagen.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3601-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Several anti-angiogenic factors are derived from proteolytic processing of large molecules including endostatin from type XVIII collagen and angiostatin from plasminogen. In previous studies we showed that neostatin-7, the C-terminal 28kDa endostatin-spanning proteolytic fragment, is generated from the proteolytic action of matrix metalloproteinase matrilysin (MMP)-7 on type XVIII collagen. Now, we report a second member of the neostatin family of proteins, neostatin-14. Given the small quantities of neostatin-7 and -14 generated by the breakdown of naturally occurring collagen XVIII (using MMP-7 and -14, respectively), we used two other approaches to characterize the anti-angiogenic properties of these molecules: murine recombinant neostatin in vitro, and gene therapy. We demonstrate that murine recombinant neostatin-7 inhibits calf pulmonary artery endothelial cell proliferation and that microinjection of neostatin-7 and neostatin-14 naked DNA into the corneal stroma of mice results in significant reduction of basic fibroblast growth factor-induced corneal neovascularization. These results provide supportive evidence of the possible anti-angiogenic effect of neostatins.

Proteomic analysis of slow- and fast-twitch skeletal muscles.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2896-906.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Skeletal muscles are composed of slow- and fast-twitch muscle fibers, which have high potential in aerobic and anaerobic ATP production, respectively. To investigate the molecular basis of the difference in their functions, we examined protein profiles of skeletal muscles using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with pH 4-7 and 6-11 isoelectric focusing gels. A comparison between rat soleus and extensol digitorum longus (EDL) muscles that are predominantly slow- and fast-twitch fibers, respectively, showed that the EDL muscle had higher levels of glycogen phosphorylase, most glycolytic enzymes, glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase; while the soleus muscle had higher levels of myoglobin, TCA cycle enzymes, electron transfer flavoprotein, and carbonic anhydrase III. The two muscles also expressed different isoforms of contractile proteins including myosin heavy and light chains. These protein patterns were further compared with those of red and white gastrochnemius as well as red and white quadriceps muscles. It was found that metabolic enzymes showed a concerted regulation dependent on muscle fiber types. On the other hand, expression of contractile proteins seemed to be independent of the metabolic characteristics of muscle fibers. These results suggest that metabolic enzymes and contractile proteins show different expression patterns in skeletal muscles.

A proteome approach defines protective functions of tobacco leaf
trichomes.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(10):2508-18.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The leaf surface of most terrestrial plants is covered with plant hairs called trichomes. These epidermal appendages are thought to contribute to many aspects of plant defense against biotic and abiotic stresses in a variety of species. Trichome development has been intensively studied in Arabidopsis, and the phytochemical composition of trichomes was analyzed in a number of plant species. However, comparatively little is known of the proteins expressed. We therefore initiated a proteome approach to better define the cellular mechanisms operating in plant trichomes using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to separate proteins of whole leaves and isolated trichomes. Tobacco was chosen due to the presence of glandular trichomes involved in the secretion of defense compounds. Comparative image analysis of the protein patterns indicated a number of spots, which were highly enriched in trichomes relative to leaves. These spots were excised for identification by mass spectrometry. The results showed that among the proteins specifically enriched in trichomes, the components of stress defense responses were strongly represented. The high expression of stress-related proteins was verified by Western blotting. Superoxide dismutase isoforms were additionally analyzed by activity staining. Our results demonstrate feasibility of the proteome approach to elucidate the cell biology of plant trichomes.

Proteomic analysis of synaptosomes using isotope-coded affinity tags and

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(10):2531-41.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Synaptosomes are isolated synapses produced by subcellular fractionation of brain tissue. They contain the complete presynaptic terminal, including mitochondria and synaptic vesicles, and portions of the postsynaptic side, including the postsynaptic membrane and the postsynaptic density (PSyD). A proteomic characterisation of synaptosomes isolated from mouse brain was performed employing the isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) method and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). After isotopic labelling and tryptic digestion, peptides were fractionated by cation exchange chromatography and cysteine-containing peptides were isolated by affinity chromatography. The peptides were identified by microcapillary liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation MS/MS (muLC-ESI MS/MS). In two experiments, peptides representing a total of 1131 database entries were identified. They are involved in different presynaptic and postsynaptic functions, including synaptic vesicle exocytosis for neurotransmitter release, vesicle endocytosis for synaptic vesicle recycling, as well as postsynaptic receptors and proteins constituting the PSyD. Moreover, a large number of soluble and membrane-bound molecules serving functions in synaptic signal transduction and metabolism were detected. The results provide an inventory of the synaptic proteome and confirm the suitability of the ICAT method for the assessment of synaptic structure, function and plasticity.

Proteomics of the rat gut: analysis of the myenteric plexus-longitudinal
muscle preparation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(10):2561-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The enteric nervous system (ENS)--present all along the gastrointestinal tract - is the largest and most complicated division of the peripheral nervous system that can function independently of the brain. The peripheral nerve cells are organized in two separate but interconnected meshworks, called the myenteric and submucous plexus. The nervous control of intestinal motility is primarily governed by the myenteric plexus (MP), which lies in-between the longitudinal- (LM) and circular-muscle layers and regulates their functions. To determine whether the proteomic technology is adapted to the analysis of specific gut tissues, we dissected the MP-LM layers from the jejunum, ileum, and colon of Long Evans rats, homogenized them, and separated the proteins using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. A subset of all the visualized protein spots, covering the entire range of molecular weights and isoelectric points, was then selected and further analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. We identified around 80 proteins in each gut segment, and among those, five were segment-specific. Most of the proteins identified were derived from muscle cells, but we also detected some neuron-specific proteins. This study represents, to our knowledge, the first extensive protein catalog of a neuromuscular layer of the rat intestine and it may constitute the basis to understand pathophysiological mechanisms related to the ENS.

Two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis analysis of

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(10):2648-55.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Urinary proteins may provide clues regarding pathogenesis of kidney disease as well as providing markers of disease activity. We employed two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoretic analysis (2-D DIGE) to assess multiple urine samples in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Patient samples were collected as timed overnight collections. All the patients had longstanding diabetes, impaired renal function, and overt proteinuria. Control and patient urinary protein were analyzed by 2-D DIGE and DeCyder analysis. Ninety-nine spots were significantly regulated in the urine proteome of the diabetic samples, with 63 up- and 36 down-regulated. One spot corresponding to a pI 5-6 and a molecular weight between 45 and 66 kDa was consistently up-regulated by 19-fold across individuals in the diabetic group. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight analysis of in-gel tryptic digest of this spot identified this protein as alpha 1 antitrypsin (AAT). ELISA of urine samples from a separate group of patients and controls confirmed a marked increase of AAT in diabetic patients. Immunostaining of human diabetic kidneys revealed up-regulation of AAT in areas of renal fibrosis. In conclusion, we developed a method to analyze numerous urine samples from patients and allowed for detection and identification of regulated urine protein spots.

Probing heat-stable water-soluble proteins from barley to malt and beer.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2849-58.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteins determine the quality of barley in malting and brewing end-uses. In this regard, water-soluble barley proteins play a major role in the formation, stability, and texture of head foams. Our objective was to survey the barley seed proteins that could be involved in the foaming properties of beer. Therefore, two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were combined to highlight the barley proteins that could resist the heating treatments occurring during malting and brewing processes. As expected, from barley to malt and to beer, most of the heat-stable proteins are disulfide-rich proteins, implicated in the defense of plants against their bio-aggressors, e.g., serpin-like chymotrypsin inhibitors (protein Z), amylase and amylase-protease inhibitors, and lipid transfer proteins (LTP1 and LTP2). For LTP1s, the complex pattern displayed in 2-D electrophoresis could be related to some chemical modifications already described elsewhere, such as acylation or glycation through Maillard reactions, which occur on malting. Our proteomics approach allowed the identification of the numerous proteins present in beer in addition to the major ones already described. The involvement of these proteins in the quality of beer foam can now be evaluated.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2718-28.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Membrane proteins play a central role in biological processes, but their separation and quantification using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is often limited by their poor solubility and relatively low abundance. We now present a method for the simultaneous recovery, separation, identification, and relative quantification of membrane proteins, following their selective covalent modification with a cleavable biotin derivative. After cell lysis, biotinylated proteins are purified on streptavidin-coated resin and proteolytically digested. The resulting peptides are analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, thus yielding a two-dimensional peptide map. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight signal intensity of peptides, in the presence of internal standards, is used to quantify the relative abundance of membrane proteins from cells treated in different experimental conditions. As experimental examples, we present (i) an analysis of a BSA-spiked human embryonic kidney membrane protein extract, and (ii) an analysis of membrane proteins of human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. This last study allowed the recovery of the vascular endothelial-cadherin/actin/catenin complex, revealing an increased accumulation of beta-catenin at 2% O(2) concentration.

Comparative proteomic analysis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2960-71.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Ranking as the fourth commonest cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) represents one of the leading causes of cancer death in China. One of the main reasons for the low survival rate is that neoplasms in esophagus are not detected until they have invaded into surrounding tissues or spread throughout the body at advanced stages. A better understanding of the malignant mechanism and early diagnosis are important for fighting ESCC. In this study, we used proteomics to analyze ESCC tissues, aiming at defining the proteomic features implicated in the multistage progression of esophageal carcinogenesis. Proteins that exhibited significantly different expressions were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting and validated by Western blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The protein changes were then correlated to the different grades of disease differentiation. Compared to those in adjacent normal epitheliums, the expression of 15 proteins including enolase, elongation factor Tu, isocitrate dehydrogenase, tubulin alpha-1 chain, tubulin beta-5 chain, actin (cytoplasmic 1), glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase, tropomyosin isoform 4 (TPM4), prohibitin, peroxiredoxin 1 (PRX1), manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), neuronal protein, and transgelin was up-regulated; and the expression of five proteins including TPM1, squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (SCCA1), stratifin, peroxiredoxin 2 isoform a, and alpha B crystalline was down-regulated in cancer tissues with a statistical significance (p < 0.05). In addition, the differential expression of SCCA1, PRX1, MnSOD, TPM4, and prohibitin can be observed in precancerous lesions of ESCC. The expression of stratifin, prohibitin, and SCCA1 dropped with increasing dedifferentiation of ESCC. These data may suggest that these proteins contribute to the multistage process of carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and invasiveness of ESCC.

Improving feature detection and analysis of surface-enhanced laser

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2778-88.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Discovering valid biological information from surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) depends on clear experimental design, meticulous sample handling, and sophisticated data processing. Most published literature deals with the biological aspects of these experiments, or with computer-learning algorithms to locate sets of classifying biomarkers. The process of locating and measuring proteins across spectra has received less attention. This process should be tunable between sensitivity and false-discovery, and should guarantee that features are biologically meaningful in that they represent chemical species that can be identified and investigated. Existing feature detection in SELDI-TOF MS is not optimal for acquiring biologically relevant data. Most methods have so many user-defined settings that reproducibility and comparability among studies suffer considerably. To address these issues, we have developed an approach, called simultaneous spectrum analysis (SSA), which (i) locates proteins across spectra, (ii) measures their abundance, (iii) subtracts baseline, (iv) excludes irreproducible measurements, and (v) computes normalization factors for comparing spectra. SSA uses only two key parameters for feature detection and one parameter each for quality thresholds on spectra and peaks. The effectiveness of SSA is demonstrated by identifying proteins differentially expressed in SELDI-TOF spectra from plasma of wild-type and knockout mice for plasma glutathione peroxidase. Comparing analyses by SSA and CiphergenExpress Data Manager 2.1 finds similar results for large signal peaks, but SSA improves the number and quality of differences betweens groups among lower signal peaks. SSA is also less likely to introduce systematic bias when normalizing spectra.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2981-99.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Mitochondrial diseases may be caused by numerous mutations that alter proteins of the respiratory chain and of other metabolic pathways in the mitochondrium. For clinicians this disease group poses a considerable diagnostic challenge due to ambiguous genotype-phenotype relationships. Until now, only 30% of the mitochondriopathies can be diagnosed at the molecular level. We therefore need a new diagnostic tool that offers a wide view on the mitochondrial proteins. Here, we present a method to generate a high-resolution, large-gel two-dimensional gel electrophoretic (2-DE) map of a purified fraction of mitochondrial proteins from Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). LCLs can be easily obtained from patients and control subjects in a routine clinical setting. They often express the biochemical phenotype and can be cultured to high cell numbers, sufficient to gain enough purified material for 2-DE. In total we identified 166 mitochondrial proteins. Thirteen proteins were earlier not known to be of mitochondrial origin. Thirty-nine proteins were associated with human diseases ranging from respiratory chain enzyme deficiencies to disorders of beta-oxidation and amino acid metabolism. This 2-DE map is intended to be the first step to diagnose mitochondrial diseases at the proteomic level.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2789-98.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Profiling of peptides and small proteins from either human body fluids or tissues by chromatography and subsequent mass spectrometry reveals several thousand individual peptide signals per sample. Any peptide is an intermediate in the course of biosynthesis, post-translational modification (PTM), proteolytic processing and degradation. Changes in the concentration of one peptide often affects the concentration of the other, hence a challenge consists in the development of suitable tools to turn this large amount of data into biologically relevant information. Comprehensive statistical analysis of the peptide profiling data allows associating peptides, which are closely related in terms of peptide biochemistry. Here, the bioinformatic concept of peptide networks, correlation-associated peptide networks (CANs), is introduced. Peptides with statistical similarity of their concentrations are grouped in form of networks, and these networks are interpreted in terms of peptide biochemistry. The spectrum of functional relationships found in cerebrospinal fluid CAN covers PTM and proteolytic degradation of peptides, clearance processing in the complement cascade, common secretion of peptides by neuroendocrine cells as well as ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Our results indicate that CAN is a powerful bioinformatic tool for the systematic analysis and interpretation of large peptidomics and proteomics data and helps to discover novel bioactive and diagnostic peptides.

Transfer of beta subunit regulation from high to low voltage-gated Ca2+

<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 18;579(18):3907-12.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
High voltage-activated Ca(2+) channel expression and gating is controlled by their beta subunits. Although the sites of interaction are known at the atomic level, how beta modulates gating remains to be determined. Using a chimeric approach, beta subunit regulation was conferred to a low voltage-activated channel. Regulation was dependent on a rigid linker connecting the alpha(1) interaction domain to IS6. Chimeric channels also revealed a role for IS6 in channel gating. Taken together, these results support a direct coupling model where beta subunits alter movements in IS6 that occur as the channel transits between closed, open, and inactivated states.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 18;579(18):3899-906.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Several different types of interactions between sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) have been revealed recently. In this work, we used HEK293 cells to further investigate the potential crosstalk. Interestingly, we observed that S1P specifically induced a PDGFR-dependent cell detachment in HEK293 cells, which could be inhibited by AG1296, a specific inhibitor for PDGFR. EGFR on the other hand, did not have any effect on cell detachment. The detachment was extracellular matrix (ECM) protein specific, suggesting the involvement of specific integrin molecules. When beta(1) integrin was engaged into an active state, S1P-induced cell detachment was blocked, suggesting that S1P induced an inside-out inhibitory effect on beta(1) integrin. G(i) protein and ERK activation were required for the cell detachment induced by S1P, suggesting an endogenous receptor for S1P is likely to be involved.

Molecular interaction of delta-conotoxins with voltage-gated sodium
channels.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Various neurotoxic peptides modulate voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channels and thereby affect cellular excitability. Delta-conotoxins from predatory cone snails slow down inactivation of Na(V) channels, but their interaction site and mechanism of channel modulation are unknown. Here, we show that delta-conotoxin SVIE from Conus striatus interacts with a conserved hydrophobic triad (YFV) in the domain-4 voltage sensor of Na(V) channels. This site overlaps with that of the scorpion alpha-toxin Lqh-2, but not with the alpha-like toxin Lqh-3 site. Delta-SVIE functionally competes with Lqh-2, but exhibits strong cooperativity with Lqh-3, presumably by synergistically trapping the voltage sensor in its "on" position.

<ABSTRACT>
It is generally believed that compatible osmolytes stabilize proteins by shifting the denaturation equilibrium, native state <--> denatured state toward the left. We show here that if osmolytes are compatible with the functional activity of the protein at a given pH and temperature, they should not significantly perturb this denaturation equilibrium under the same experimental conditions. This conclusion was reached from the measurements of the activity parameters (K(m) and k(cat)) and guanidinium chloride-induced denaturations of lysozyme and ribonuclease-A in the presence of five polyols (sorbitol, glycerol, mannitol, xylitol and adonitol) at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C.

Unfolding and breakdown of insulin in the presence of endogenous thiols.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 18;579(18):3927-31.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Native insulin denatures and unfolds in the presence of thiol catalyst via disulfide scrambling (isomerization). It undergoes two transient non-native conformational isomers, followed by an irreversible breakdown of the protein to form oxidized A- and B-chain. Denaturation and breakdown of native insulin may occur under physiological conditions. At 37 degrees C, pH 7.4, and in the presence of cysteine (0.2 mM), native insulin decomposes with a pseudo first order kinetic of 0.075 h(-1). At 50 degrees C, the rate increases by 5-fold. GdnCl and urea induced denaturation of insulin follows the same mechanism. These results demonstrate that stability and unfolding pathway of insulin in the presence of endogenous thiol differ fundamentally from its reversible denaturation observed in the absence of thiol, in which native disulfide bonds of insulin were kept intact during the process of denaturation.

Various catalytic antibodies or abzymes (Abzs) have been detected recently in the sera of patients and animals with many autoimmune diseases, where their presence is most probably associated with autoimmunization. Normal humans or animals usually do not contain Abzs. In contrast, polyclonal Abzs from healthy humans and animals have an intrinsic superoxide dismutase activity and catalyze formation of H(2)O(2) (Wentworth et al., 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA; 2001, Science). Here, we present the first evidence showing that highly purified native IgGs from the sera of healthy Wistar rats interact with H(2)O(2) and possess peroxidase-like activity. Specific peroxidase activity of IgG preparations from the sera of 10 rats varied in the range 1.6-27% as compared with that for horseradish peroxidase (100%). Antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutases, catalases, and glutathione peroxidases are known to represent critical defence mechanisms for preventing oxidative modifications of DNA, proteins, and lipids. Antioxidant peroxidase activity of Abzs can also play an important role in the protection of organisms from oxidative stress as well as in oxidation of toxic compounds.

<ABSTRACT>
Coordinated protein expression is critical for the normal execution of animal development. To obtain overall proteome profiles during animal development, a small free-living soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, was used as a model and the developmental changes of protein expressions were analyzed using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis. Protein samples from six developmental stages were prelabeled with fluorescent cyanine dyes and separated on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels. Image-to-image analysis of protein abundances together with protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting yielded the developmental expression profiles of 231 spots representing 165 proteins. About a quarter of the identified proteins were expressed in multiple spots with different isoelectric points, suggesting a certain proportion of proteins were variously modified. This notion was supported by the observation that about a third of the multispot proteins were stained positive for a phosphoprotein specific dye. While a fairly large number of the proteins showed little alteration in their expression profiles during development, about 40 proteins were found to be significantly either up- or down-regulated between the embryos and newly hatched L1 larvae. Down-regulated proteins included those related to the cell cycle such as MCM-7, PCN-1, and the mitotic checkpoint protein, while up-regulated proteins included structural proteins such as actins, LEV-11, DIM-1, VAB-21, metabolic enzymes such as ATP synthase, ALH-12, fluctose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and GPD-3, and galectins. A standard proteome map was obtained where the defects in the mutations of developmental genes and the effects of reagents on the development in C. elegans were analyzed.

Proteomic signatures for histological types of lung cancer.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2939-48.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We performed proteomic studies on lung cancer cells to elucidate the mechanisms that determine histological phenotype. Thirty lung cancer cell lines with three different histological backgrounds (squamous cell carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) were subjected to two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) and grouped by multivariate analyses on the basis of their protein expression profiles. 2-D DIGE achieves more accurate quantification of protein expression by using highly sensitive fluorescence dyes to label the cysteine residues of proteins prior to two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We found that hierarchical clustering analysis and principal component analysis divided the cell lines according to their original histology. Spot ranking analysis using a support vector machine algorithm and unsupervised classification methods identified 32 protein spots essential for the classification. The proteins corresponding to the spots were identified by mass spectrometry. Next, lung cancer cells isolated from tumor tissue by laser microdissection were classified on the basis of the expression pattern of these 32 protein spots. Based on the expression profile of the 32 spots, the isolated cancer cells were categorized into three histological groups: the squamous cell carcinoma group, the adenocarcinoma group, and a group of carcinomas with other histological types. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the utility of quantitative proteomic analysis for molecular diagnosis and classification of lung cancer cells.

Increased lungkine and chitinase levels in allergic airway inflammation: a
proteomics approach.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2799-807.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by pulmonary eosinophilia and airway hyperresponsiveness. Mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of asthma are still not fully understood. The present study investigated alterations in global protein expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in allergic airway inflammation using a proteomics approach. BALB/c mice sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin developed airway eosinophilia, mucus hypersecretion, elevation of immunoglobulin E, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Lavage fluid proteins from normal and asthmatic mice were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. A total of 28 protein spots were significantly altered. Several of these proteins were undetectable or at very low levels in normal mice but were significantly increased in airway inflammation. These include lungkine, a recently described chemokine, a family of chitinases including Ym1, Ym2, and acidic mammalian chitinase, gob-5, a protein that mediates mucus secretion, and surfactant protein-D, a C-type lectin capable of modulating inflammatory responses. Overall, proteomics is a powerful tool in unraveling protein expression changes in allergic airway inflammation. The proteins identified in this study may be associated with the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation and may also be found useful as surrogate biomarkers for asthma.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2949-59.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The determination of possible biomarkers in nasal secretion of healthy subjects can have a role in early diagnosis of diseases such as rhinosinusitis. For this purpose, nasal lavage fluids (NLFs) from ten volunteers, collected before and after they had been submitted to nasal provocations, were investigated. Separation and analysis of proteins present in this complex matrix was performed using a capillary liquid chromatography-electrospray-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry equipment. From among a total of 111 proteins found (89 known and two unknown proteins), 42 of which had never been previously described in this fluid, such as Deleted in Malignant Brain Tumors 1 isoform a precursors, and cytoskeletal proteins were identified with high statistical score. Three proteins of palate lung nasal epithelial clone (PLUNC) family: SPLUNC1, LPLUNC1, and LPLUNC2 were identified. Proteins involved in innate (27%) and acquired immunity (21%) systems were major components of NLF. Cellular (52% of all proteins identified) such as cytoskeletal (33%), functional (15%), and regulatory (4%) proteins, normally present in the nasal cavity, have also been identified. The proteomic approach presented here allowed us to identify the proteins involved in acquired and innate immune response in the nose against microbial infections and unclean inhaled air.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2839-48.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A proteomics study using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry was performed on Phytophthora infestans. Proteins from cysts, germinated cysts and appressoria grown in vitro were isolated and separated by 2-DE. Statistical quantitative analysis of the protein spots from five independent experiments of each developmental stage revealed significant up-regulation of ten spots on gels from germinated cysts compared to cysts. Five spots were significantly up-regulated on gels from appressoria compared to germinated cysts and one of these up-regulated spots was not detectable on gels from cysts. In addition, one spot was significantly down-regulated and another spot not detectable on the gels from appressoria. The corresponding proteins to 13 of these spots were identified with high confidence using tandem mass spectrometry and database searches. The functions of the proteins that were up-regulated in germinated cysts and appressoria can be grouped into the following categories: protein synthesis (e.g. a DEAD box RNA helicase), amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species scavenging. The spot not detected in appressoria was identified as the P. infestans crinkling- and necrosis-inducing protein CRN2. The identified proteins are most likely involved in the establishment of the infection of the host plant.

Including mutations from conceptually translated expressed sequence tags
into orthologous proteins improves the preliminary assignment of peptide
mass fingerprints on non-model genomes.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2769-77.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve protein assignment from peptide mass fingerprints (PMF) in species with incompletely sequenced genomes, the genus-specific mutations deduced from Expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences were included in the complete reading frames of orthologous proteins, resulting in a new searchable in silico protein database. Using this method in tests on four plant species, the MOWSE score of at least 20% more proteins was improved compared to conventional approaches on crude, total proteins, for middle-sized EST projects. Larger contigs are assembled in more important EST projects and this improves the conventional assignment of the most abundant proteins. However, contigs from minor transcripts remain shorter and the assignment of less abundant proteins, such as those isolated following subcellular fractionment, is improved by searching orthologue-EST conceptual chimeras with the PMF spectra. This strategy may be utilized as a tool to identify potential PMF matches that can be then verified by other experimental approaches (tandem mass spectrometry) to ensure the EST matched chimera identification is accurate.

A quantitative description of the activation and inhibition of CFTR by
potentiators: Genistein.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 18;579(18):3979-83.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The CFTR, encoded by the gene mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, is responsible for cAMP dependent chloride transport in epithelia. Substances that activate CFTR have been suggested as possible CF therapy. Most substances investigated so far exert a dual effect on the CFTR: low concentrations stimulate CFTR, whereas higher concentrations inhibit CFTR. Besides, the CFTR phosphorylation level determines the apparent affinity of the drug. We have studied the properties of genistein, the well known CFTR potentiator, by measuring apical membrane current on epithelia formed by cells stably transfected with CFTR and stimulated with different concentrations of CPTcAMP. We propose a quantitative model to describe the activatory and inhibitory effect of genistein, accounting also for the cAMP dependent activation.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha (cPLA(2)alpha) plays an important role in arachidonate pathway. To investigate the contribution of cPLA(2)alpha to autoimmune diabetes, we established non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, an excellent model for human type 1 diabetes, deficient in cPLA(2)alpha. These mice showed severe insulitis and a higher incidence of diabetes. In their macrophages, decreased prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) induced by cPLA(2)alpha deficiency, and the increase in production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were observed. These results suggested that cPLA(2)alpha plays a protective role in progression of insulitis and development of autoimmune diabetes by suppression of TNF-alpha production from macrophages.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 18;579(18):3941-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Ets-1 is a cellular homologue of the product of the viral ets oncogene of the E26 virus, and it functions as a tissue-specific transcription factor. It plays an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, lymphoid cell development, transformation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Ets-1 controls the expression of critical genes involved in these processes by binding to ets binding sites present in the transcriptional regulatory regions. Here, we transiently overexpressed Ets-1 in MCF-7 and comprehensively searched for potential downstream targets of Ets-1 by cDNA microarray analysis. The expressions of several interferon-related genes including STAT1 and Nmi were augmented by the overexpression of Ets-1. RT-PCR and Western blotting confirmed the increase in the levels of STAT1 and Nmi mRNA and protein. In contrast, Ets-1 siRNA decreased the expression of STAT1 and Nmi proteins. As in our transient transfection experiments, stable overexpression of Ets-1, also increased the protein expression of STAT1 and Nmi in MCF-7 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that STAT1 and Nmi are downstream targets of Ets-1 in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.

Inducible expression of a degradation-resistant form of p27Kip1 causes
growth arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 18;579(18):3932-40.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27(Kip1) (p27) is an important regulator of cell cycle progression controlling the transition from G to S-phase. Low p27 levels or accelerated p27 degradation correlate with excessive cell proliferation and poor prognosis in several forms of cancer. Phosphorylation of p27 at Thr187 by cyclin E-CDK2 is required to initiate the ubiquitination-proteasomal degradation of p27. Protecting p27 from ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation may increase its potential in cancer gene therapy. Here we constructed a non-phosphorylatable, proteolysis-resistant p27 mutant containing a Thr187-to-Ala substitution (T187A) which is not degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway, and compared its effects on cell growth, cell-cycle control, and apoptosis with those of wild-type p27. In muristerone A-inducible cell lines overexpressing wild-type or mutant p27, the p27 mutant was more resistant to proteolysis in vivo and more potent in inducing cell-cycle arrest and other growth-inhibitory effects such as apoptosis. Transduction of p27(T187A) in breast cancer cells with a doxycycline-regulated adenovirus led to greater inhibition of proliferation, more extensive apoptosis, with a markedly reduced protein levels of cyclin E and increased accumulation of cyclin D1, compared with wild-type p27. These findings support the potential effectiveness of a degradation-resistant form of p27 in breast cancer gene therapy.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 18;579(18):3867-71.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Previous investigations by Southern hybridization of cDNA with compositional DNA fractions showed that the majority of maize genes are located in a narrow GC range of DNA fragments and that the corresponding gene space was GC-richer than the region of the genome where zein genes are found. Here, we revisited the maize gene space using new data from the maize genome sequencing initiative. We found that the maize gene space itself is formed of two compositional compartments, i.e., a GC-poor and a GC-rich, characterized by a different distribution of Opie and Huck retrotransposons. The GC-rich compartment tends to be richer in GC-rich genes than the GC-poor compartment. However, the gene space compartimentalization of maize is much simpler than that of human.

Ubiquitination-resistant p53 protein transduction therapy facilitates
anti-cancer effect on the growth of human malignant glioma cells.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 18;579(18):3965-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Protein transduction therapy using poly-arginine can deliver the bioactive p53 protein into cancer cells and inhibits the proliferation of the cells. However, one disadvantage of such therapy is the short intracellular half-life of the delivered protein. Here, we generated mutant proteins in which multiple lysine residues in the C-terminal were substituted by arginines. The mutant proteins were effectively delivered in glioma cells and were resistant to Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination. Moreover, the mutant proteins displayed higher transcription regulatory activity and powerful inhibition of the proliferation of glioma cells. These results suggest that ubiquitination-resistant p53 protein therapy may become a new effective cancer therapy.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 18;579(18):3947-52.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is one of the best-described cell death promoters. In murine L929 fibroblasts, dexamethasone inhibits TNF-alpha-induced cytotoxicity. Since phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) proteins regulate several survival pathways, we evaluated their participation in dexamethasone protection against TNF-alpha cell death. We interfered with these pathways by overexpressing a negative dominant mutant of PI3K or a non-degradable mutant of inhibitor of NF-kappaB alpha (IkappaBalpha) (the cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-kappaB) in L929 cells. The mutant IkappaB, but not the mutant PI3K, abrogated dexamethasone-mediated protection. The loss of dexamethasone protection was associated with a diminished accumulation in XIAP and c-IAP proteins.

Proteomic identification of differentially-expressed genes in human

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3205-13.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Although genetic alterations in proto-oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes, cell cycle regulators, and cell growth factors have been implicated in the process of human gastric carcinogenesis, the principle carcinogenic mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we used a proteomic approach to search for genes that may be involved in gastric carcinogenesis and that might serve as diagnostic markers. We identified nine proteins with increased expression and 13 proteins with decreased expression in gastric carcinomas. The two most notable groups included proteins involved in mitotic checkpoint (MAD1L1 and EB1) and mitochondrial functions (CLPP, COX5A, and ECH1). This suggested that there are links between dysfunctions in these processes and gastric carcinogenesis. We also observed the differential expression of HSP27 and CYR61 proteins in gastric carcinoma, whose expression is known to be altered in other types of tumors. Furthermore, the study identified proteins whose function in gastric carcinomas was previously unsuspected and that may serve as new molecular markers for gastric carcinomas. Importantly, immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that the levels of expression of MAD1L1, HSP27, and CYR61 were altered in gastric carcinoma tissues. Therefore, our study suggested not only that the proteins identified in this study can be useful diagnostic markers but also that a proteomics-based approach is useful for developing a more complete picture of the pathogenesis and function of gastric carcinomas.

<ABSTRACT>
2-D peptide mapping is a novel technique for the relative quantification of membrane proteins (Scheurer S. et al., Proteomics 2005, in press). Using closely related metastatic and nonmetastatic teratocarcinoma cell lines as a model system, we have performed a comparative analysis of different biotinylation reagents, tryptic digestion procedures, and mass spectrometric techniques, with the aim to increase the number of proteins identified by 2-D peptide mapping. Our experience indicates that the LC-MALDI TOF/TOF technique is superior to LC-ESI MS/MS in terms of the number of proteins identified and confidence in protein identification. Furthermore, the best results were obtained by tryptic digestion of proteins eluted from a streptavidin column using a cleavable biotin derivative.

<ABSTRACT>
In the process of atherosclerosis, platelet activating factor (PAF) promotes the infiltration of inflammatory cells into atherosclerotic plaque by modulating their cytoskeleton. Here, we examined whether Rho family proteins are involved in PAF-induced cytoskeletal reorganization in THP-1 macrophages. PAF stimulation rapidly induced cell elongation, accompanied by filopodia formation. The inhibition of Rho family proteins by the overexpression of Rho-GDI attenuated the PAF-mediated morphological changes. Both RhoA and Cdc42 were activated in response to PAF. Inhibition of RhoA or Cdc42 by dominant negative mutants abrogated morphological changes induced by PAF. Collectively, PAF regulates cytoarchitecture through Rho family proteins in macrophages.

<ABSTRACT>
The ability of inflammatory cytokine TGF-beta1 to alter endothelial cell phenotype suggests its role in the regulation of vascular endothelial cell permeability. We demonstrate that depletion of TGF-beta1 receptor ALK5 and regulatory protein Smad4, but not ALK1 receptor attenuates TGF-beta1-induced permeability increase and significantly inhibits TGF-beta1-induced EC contraction manifested by actin stress fiber formation and increased MLC and MYPT1 phosphorylation. Consistent with these results, EC treatment with SB 431542, an inhibitor of ALK5 but not ALK1 receptor, significantly attenuates TGF-beta1-induced permeability. Thus, our data demonstrate for the first time direct link between TGF-beta1-mediated activation of ALK5/Smad and EC barrier dysfunction.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Human retinal pigmented epithelial cell (hRPE) proliferation plays a significant role in various proliferative diseases associated to the retina that leads to loss of vision, such as proliferative vitreoretinopathy. In the current study, the role of the bovine vitreous lipid factor (bVLF) in hRPE cell proliferation has been investigated. bVLF is a bioactive lipid isolated from the bovine vitreous body with strong Ca(2+)-mobilizing activity in fibroblast. In the first approach, the effects of bVLF on Ca(2+)-mobilizing activity were investigated in hRPE. The results showed that bVLF induced, in a dose-dependent manner, a Ca(2+) mobilization from PA-sensitive intracellular stores [non-Ins(1,4,5)P(3)-sensitive stores], in which extracellular Ca(2+) participated. The increase in intracellular Ca(2+) was associated with a dose-dependent inhibiting effect on cell proliferation. At a dose of 10 microg/mL, bVLF caused a 26% or a 44% inhibition in hRPE cell proliferation during the 3- or the 6-day culture periods, respectively. These effects appear to be specific in hRPE cells, since EFGR-T17 fibroblast cells treated with equivalent amounts of bVLF did not show any inhibiting effects. This inhibitory action was not associated to apoptotic/necrotic processes. Furthermore, bVLF inhibited EGF-, bFGF-, IGF-I-, PDGF-, HGF- and VEGF-induced proliferation of the hRPE cells. Moreover, this inhibitory response was also observed in FBS-induced hRPE cell proliferation. bVLF, at a concentration of 10 microg/mL, induced 16% inhibition of proliferation during a culture period of 3 days. This inhibitory action was greater during the 6-day culture period, exceeding 40%. With regard to this action, the results showed that bVLF has a potent inhibitory effect on ERK1/2 activation, and plays a key role in the control of hRPE cell proliferation. These observations contribute to the knowledge of inhibitory factors responsible for keeping antiproliferative environment that preserve the RPE-associated activities in normal states. It advances the interesting possibility that this factor or a factor with characteristics common to bVLF might be involved in the pathogenesis of abnormal proliferative eye processes.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
It is a common knowledge that the photosynthesis efficiency drops rapidly under the long-wavelength light excitation above 680 nm. We discovered that in sunflower leaves attached to the plant the initial fall is replaced by an unexpected increase at much longer wavelengths, so that a detectable O(2) evolution is remained till 780 nm. The quantum yield of O(2) evolution at the local maximum at 745 nm reaches almost 20% of the yield at 650 nm. We conclude that extreme long-wavelength chlorophylls may be present in the intact photosystem II antenna system, similarly to photosystem I.

<ABSTRACT>
Previously, we found that intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) affect photomorphogenesis in Neurospora crassa. In this study, we investigated the physiological roles of ROS in the response to light and found that the exposure of mycelia to air was important for the light-induced carotenogenesis. Mycelia treated with a high concentration of O(2) gas and H(2)O(2) to release ROS showed an enhancement of light-induced carotenoid accumulation and the expression of gene related to light-inducible carotenogenesis. These results suggested that stimuli caused by the exposure of the mycelia to air containing O(2) gas triggered the light-induced carotenoid synthesis.

<ABSTRACT>
In vivo and in vitro studies have suggested a neuroprotective role for Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) against neuronal insults. Here, we showed that PACAP27 protects against neurotoxicity induced by rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The neuroprotective effect of PACAP27 was dose-dependent and blocked by its specific receptor antagonist, PACAP6-27. The effects of PACAP27 on rotenone-induced cell death were mimicked by dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP), forskolin and prevented by the PKA inhibitor H89, the ERK inhibitor PD98059 and the p38 inhibitor SB203580. PACAP27 administration blocked rotenone-induced increases in the level of caspase-3-like activity, whereas could not restore mitochondrial activity damaged by rotenone. Thus, our results demonstrate that PACAP27 has a neuroprotective role against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal differentiated PC12 cells and the neuroprotective effects of PACAP are associated with activation of MAP kinase pathways by PKA and with inhibition of caspase-3 activity; the signaling mechanism appears to be mediated through mitochondrial-independent pathways.

Glycogen synthesis in the absence of glycogenin in the yeast Saccharomyces

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 18;579(18):3999-4004.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In eukaryotic cells, glycogenin is a self-glucosylating protein that primes glycogen synthesis. In yeast, the loss of function of GLG1 and GLG2, which encode glycogenin, normally leads to the inability of cells to synthesize glycogen. In this report, we show that a small fraction of colonies from glg1glg2 mutants can switch on glycogen synthesis to levels comparable to wild-type strain. The occurrence of glycogen positive glg1glg2 colonies is strongly enhanced by the presence of a hyperactive glycogen synthase and increased even more upon deletion of TPS1. In all cases, this phenotype is reversible, indicating the stochastic nature of this synthesis, which is furthermore illustrated by colour-sectoring of colonies upon iodine-staining. Altogether, these data suggest that glycogen synthesis in the absence of glycogenin relies on a combination of several factors, including an activated glycogen synthase and as yet unknown alternative primers whose synthesis and/or distribution may be controlled by TPS1 or under epigenetic silencing.

Stimulation of GCMa and syncytin via cAMP mediated PKA signaling in human
trophoblastic cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 18;579(18):3991-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Glial cells missing a (GCMa) belongs to a new transcription factor family. Syncytin was shown to be a target gene of GCMa. Here, we demonstrate that the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway acts upstream of GCMa. After transient transfection of BeWo cells with PKA, GCMa transcriptional activity and both GCMa and syncytin transcripts were upregulated. This increase was accompanied by further cellular differentiation. Using normoxic or hypoxic conditions to mimic pathophysiological settings known to diminish trophoblast differentiation, we found that gene repressive effects of oxygen deficiency were compensated by the induction of the PKA pathway. We propose that GCMa-driven syncytin expression is the key mechanism for syncytiotrophoblast formation.

The coupling mechanism of P-glycoprotein involves residue L339 in the
sixth membrane spanning segment.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 18;579(18):3984-90.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The transmembrane (TM) domains in P-glycoprotein (P-gp) contain the drug binding sites and undergo conformational changes driven by nucleotide catalysis to effect translocation. However, our understanding of exactly which regions are involved in such events remains unclear. A site-directed labelling approach was used to attach thiol-reactive probes to cysteines introduced into transmembrane segment 6 (TM6) in order to perturb function and infer involvement of specific residues in drug binding and/or interdomain communication. Covalent attachment of coumarin-maleimide at residue 339C within TM6 resulted in impaired ATP hydrolysis by P-gp. The nature of the effect was to reduce the characteristic modulation of basal activity caused by transported substrates, modulators and the potent inhibitor XR9576. Photoaffinity labelling of P-gp with [(3)H]-azidopine indicated that residue 339C does not alter drug binding per se. However, covalent modification of this residue appears to prevent conformational changes that lead to drug stimulation of ATP hydrolysis.

Light-dependent dimerisation in the N-terminal sensory module of

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Phytochromes, photoreceptors controlling important physiological processes in plants and many prokaryotes, are photochromic biliproteins. The red-absorbing Pr ground state is converted by light into the farred-absorbing Pfr which can be photoconverted back to Pr. In plants at least Pfr is the physiologically active signalling state. Here, we show that the N-terminal photochromic module of Cph1 homodimerises reversibly and independently in Pr and Pfr, Pfr-dimers being significantly more stable. Implications for the mechanism of signal transduction are discussed.

Interleukin-4 downregulates TNFalpha-induced IL-8 production in
keratinocytes.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 18;579(18):3953-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Interleukin (IL)-8 is a CXC chemokine induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 in different cell types including keratinocytes. IL-4 regulation of TNFalpha-induced IL-8 expression is cell-type specific. In this study, we show that in the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, IL-4 decreases TNFalpha-induced IL-8 mRNA expression. We then investigated the mechanism of IL-4 effect and showed that IL-4 downregulates TNFalpha-induced IL-8 promoter activity in luciferase reporter assays. Moreover, overexpression of either the endogenous JAK inhibitor SOCS-1 or a dominant negative form of the STAT6 transcription factor (STAT6DeltaC) interferes with the IL-4 inhibitory effect on IL-8 promoter. Finally we demonstrate, using a NF-kappaB-dependent promoter luciferase construct that IL-4 interferes, at least in part, with NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. Overall our results suggest that IL-4 regulates TNFalpha-induced IL-8 expression at a transcriptional level and this mechanism involves STAT6 and NF-kappaB transcription factors.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 18;579(18):3872-80.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Osmoregulation plays an important role in cellular responses to osmotic stress in plants and in yeast. Aquaporins contribute to osmotic adjustment by facilitating transport of water or solutes across membranes. The tonoplastic water channel BobTIP1;1 (original name BobTIP26-1) genes are upregulated during dessication stress in cauliflower meristematic tissue. To investigate the physiological importance of BobTIP1;1, we expressed it in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae osmosensitive mutant fps1Delta. We showed that the defect in the yeast glycerol plasma membrane transporter is complemented by a plant cDNA encoding the aquaporin BobTIP1;1 which is localized in the vacuolar membrane of the complemented yeast cells. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a plant aquaporin for which localization in the vacuolar membrane of yeast cells is related to an osmoresistant phenotype under hypo-osmotic shock.

A simplified 2-D electrophoresis protocol with the aid of an organic

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3088-96.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
2-DE is still a relatively cumbersome and labor intensive method. Given the successful cysteinyl protection concept with hydroxyethyl disulfide (specific oxidation) during the first dimension separation, the possibility for a simplified equilibration procedure was investigated. This was achieved by maintaining the S-mercaptoethanol modified cysteinyls throughout the 2-D workflow including second dimension separation, spot handling, protein digestion, and protein identification. The traditional equilibration protocol encompassing thiol reduction and alkylation was compared with a one-step protocol employing continuous exposure to hydroxyethyl disulfide. Both equilibration protocols gave equally well-resolved spot maps with analytical protein loads regardless of IPG strip pH range. Using preparative protein loads, narrow range IPG strips gave comparable results for the two protocols while preparative load on wide range IPG strips was the only condition where classical reduction/alkylation outperformed hydroxyethyl disulfide equilibration. Moreover, with analytical protein loads, the hydroxyethyl disulfide equilibration time could be significantly reduced without apparent loss of spot map quality or quantitative protein transfer from the first- to the second dimension gel. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric protein identification was successfully performed with either iodoacetamide or hydroxyethyl disulfide as the cysteine modifier, yielding comparable identification results with high confidence in protein assignment, sequence coverage, and detection of cysteine-containing peptides. The results provide a novel and simplified protocol for 2-DE where the concept of hydroxyethyl disulfide as the cysteinyl protecting agent is extended to cover the entire 2-D work flow.

The N-terminal fragment of gelsolin inhibits the interaction of DNase I

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3131-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Apoptosis is essential in embryonic development, clonal selection of cells of the immune system and in the prevention of cancer. Apoptotic cells display characteristic changes in morphology that precede the eventual fragmentation of nuclear DNA resulting in cell death. Current evidence implicates DNase I as responsible for hydrolysis of DNA during apoptosis. In vivo, it is likely that cytoplasmic actin binds and inhibits the enzymatic activity and nuclear translocation of DNase I and that disruption of the actin-DNase I complex results in activation of DNase I. In this report we demonstrate that the N-terminal fragment of gelsolin (N-gelsolin) disrupts the actin-DNase I interaction. This provides a molecular mechanism for the role of the N-gelsolin in regulating DNase I activity. We also show that cofilin stabilises the actin-DNase I complex by forming a ternary complex that prevents N-gelsolin from releasing DNase I from actin. We suggest that both cofilin and gelsolin are essential in modulating the release of DNase I from actin.

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3142-52.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The ability of osmoregulation is crucial to marine pathogens that always face the change of osmotic pressure when they shift between natural marine water-bodies and hosts. Previous studies indicated that the expressional patterns of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) changed when Gram-negative bacteria were transferred in different environments. In the present study, proteomic methodologies were used to investigate the expressional pattern of OMPs of Vibrio alginolyticus, a universal marine pathogen, at different Na(+) concentrations. OmpW, OmpV, and Omp TolC were determined to be osmotic stress responsive proteins. Of the three proteins, importantly, OmpV and OmpW showed distinctly reverse changes to each other, indicating that the two proteins might be the two components varied with changed NaCl concentrations. In addition, our results suggest that closely related species of bacteria with available whole genomic databases should be applied after item microorganism species was used when proteins from a bacterium with unavailable whole genomic information were identified by PMF. Therefore, our results not only expand our knowledge on osmotic stress responsive proteins, but also provide valuable information for strategies on screening of these proteins.

Cryodetector mass spectrometry profiling of plasma samples for HELLP
diagnosis: an exploratory study.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3079-87.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The cryodetector MS-based screening method enables the rapid and reliable separation of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome (HELLP) patients from healthy women. For developing the assay, plasma protein abundances from patients suffering from HELLP were profiled before and after delivery and compared to healthy pregnant and nonpregnant control individuals, using a TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a cryodetector system. The spectra were well reproducible when acquisition conditions were kept constant and the overall appearance of the profiles was well comparable. Peak areas of ten selected ion signals (9.5, 11.8, 14.0, 28.1, 43.4, 50.5, 60.1, 66.6, 74.5, and 79.8 kDa) from each spectrum were subjected to statistical analysis. Significant differences in ion intensities between the groups could be measured even without sample fractionation. The most striking difference between most of the spectra from HELLP patients and nonHELLP samples was the presence/absence of the 11.8 kDa ion signal (p-value: 0.0000365), most likely belonging to serum amyloid A (SAA). Other significant differences in ion intensities between HELLP and control samples were observed in the peak areas of the 14.0, 28.1, 50.5, and 74.5 kDa ion signals. Using the cryodetector MS data for sorting plasma samples into either the HELLP group (n = 8) or the nonHELLP group (n = 22), a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 100% were achieved. The positive predictive value of our screening assay was 100% and a negative predictive value of 95.6% was obtained with the samples included in this study.

Truncated cystatin C in cerebrospiral fluid: Technical [corrected]
artefact or biological process?
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3060-5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cystatin C, a low molecular weight cysteine proteinase inhibitor present in human body fluids at physiological concentrations, is more expressed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than in plasma. Mass spectrometric characterization showed that after 3 months of storage of human CSF at -20 degrees C, cystatin C was cleaved in the peptide bond between R8 and L9 and lost its eight N-termini amino acids, whereas this cleavage did not occur when stored at -80 degrees C. This truncation occurred in all CSF samples studied irrespective of the underlying neurological status, indicating a storage-related artefact rather than a physiological or pathological processing of the protein. These results stress the importance of optimal preanalytical storage conditions of any sample prior to proteomics studies.

Low temperature of GroEL/ES overproduction permits growth of Escherichia

FEBS Lett. 2005 Jun 13;579(15):181-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Escherichia coli trigger factor (TF) and DnaK cooperate in the folding of newly synthesized proteins. The combined deletion of the TF-encoding tig gene and the dnaK gene causes protein aggregation and synthetic lethality at 30 degrees C. Here we show that the synthetic lethality of deltatigdeltadnaK52 cells is abrogated either by growth below 30 degrees C or by overproduction of GroEL/GroES. At 23 degrees C deltatigdeltadnaK52 cells were viable and showed only minor protein aggregation. Overproduction of GroEL/GroES, but not of other chaperones, restored growth of deltatigdeltadnaK52 cells at 30 degrees C and suppressed protein aggregation including proteins >/= 60 kDa, which normally require TF and DnaK for folding. GroEL/GroES thus influences the folding of proteins previously identified as DnaK/TF substrates.

<ABSTRACT>
The transport of various S-nitrosothiols, NO and NO donors in human red blood cells (RBC) and the formation of erythrocytic S-nitrosoglutathione were investigated. Of the NO species tested only S-nitrosocysteine was found to form S-nitrosoglutathione in the RBC cytosol. L-Serine, L-cysteine and L-lysine inhibited formation of S-nitrosoglutathione. Incubation of RBC pre-incubated with S-[15N]nitroso-L-cysteine with native plasma or platelet-rich plasma led to formation of S-[15N]nitrosoalbumin and inhibited platelet aggregation, respectively. The specific transporter system of S-nitroso-L-cysteine in the RBC membrane may have implications for formation of S-nitrosoalbumin and S-nitrosohemoglobin and for transport of NO bioactivity within the vasculature.

Transient impairment of the adaptive response to fasting in FXR-deficient

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 1;579(19):4076-80.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has been suggested to play a role in gluconeogenesis. To determine whether FXR modulates the response to fasting in vivo, FXR-deficient (FXR-/-) and wild-type mice were submitted to fasting for 48 h. Our results demonstrate that FXR modulates the kinetics of alterations of glucose homeostasis during fasting, with FXR-/- mice displaying an early, accelerated hypoglycaemia response. Basal hepatic glucose production rate was lower in FXR-/- mice, together with a decrease in hepatic glycogen content. Moreover, hepatic PEPCK gene expression was transiently lower in FXR-/- mice after 6h of fasting and was decreased in FXR-/- hepatocytes. FXR therefore plays an unexpected role in the control of fuel availability upon fasting.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins occur in desiccation-tolerant organisms, including the nematode Aphelenchus avenae, and are thought to protect other proteins from aggregation. Surprisingly, expression of the LEA protein AavLEA1 in A. avenae is partially discordant with that of its gene: protein is present in hydrated animals despite low cognate mRNA levels. Moreover, on desiccation, when its gene is upregulated, AavLEA1 is specifically cleaved to discrete, smaller polypeptides. A processing activity was found in protein extracts of dehydrated, but not hydrated, nematodes, and main cleavage sites were mapped to 11-mer repeated motifs in the AavLEA1 sequence. Processed polypeptides retain function as protein anti-aggregants and we hypothesise that the expression pattern and cleavage of LEA protein allow rapid, maximal availability of active molecules to the dehydrating animal.

<ABSTRACT>
Prion diseases are characterised by severe neural lesions linked to the presence of an abnormal protease-resistant isoform of cellular prion protein (PrPc). The peptide PrP(106-126) is widely used as a model of neurotoxicity in prion diseases. Here, we examine in detail the intracellular signalling cascades induced by PrP(106-126) in cortical neurons and the participation of PrPc. We show that PrP(106-126) induces the activation of subsets of intracellular kinases (e.g., ERK1/2), early growth response 1 synthesis and induces caspase-3 activity, all of which are mediated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen-oxidase activity and oxidative stress. However, cells lacking PrPc are similarly affected after peptide exposure, and this questions the involvement of PrPc in these effects.

<ABSTRACT>
Drosophila type 2 Btk29A reveals the highest homology to Btk among mammalian Tec kinases. In Btk29A(ficP) mutant males, the apodeme holding the penis split into two pieces. Human Btk rescued this phenotype in 39% of Btk29A(ficP) males, while the Drosophila transgenes did so in 90-100% of mutants. The Btk29A(ficP) mutation reduced adult longevity to 11% that of wild-type. This effect was counteracted by Drosophila type 2, yielding 76% of the wild-type lifespan. Human Btk extended the lifespan of Btk29A(ficP) mutants only to 20% that of wild-type. Thus human Btk can partially replace Drosophila Btk29A+ in male genital development and survival.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Glutathione S-transferase P1(GSTP1) plays an important role in the detoxification and xenobiotics metabolism. Here, we show that GSTP1 is also involved in LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced inflammatory response. GSTP1 expression, determined at the transcription and translation levels, were upregulated by the LPS stimulation in RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells. GSTP1 inhibited LPS-induced mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPKs including ERK, JNK and p38 as well as NF-kappaB activation dose- and time-dependently in transient transfected and stable transfected cells. Moreover this inhibition of the signaling pathways resulted in the decrease of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. These data suggest that the GSTP1 prevents LPS-induced excessive production of pro-inflammatory factors and plays an anti-inflammatory role in response to LPS.

<ABSTRACT>
The EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 (Gefitinib, 'Iressa') blocks the cell signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis in various cancer cells. TNF-related death apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) acts as an anticancer agent. We investigated the antitumor effects of ZD1839 alone or in combination with TRAIL against human esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) lines. Although all ESCC cells expressed EGF receptor at a protein level, the effect of ZD1839 on cell growth did not correlate with the level of EGFR expression and phosphorylation of EGF receptor protein in ESCC lines. ZD1839 caused a dose-dependent growth arrest at G0-G1 phase associated with increased p27 expression. As TE8 cells are resistant to TRAIL, we tested whether ZD1839 combined with TRAIL induced apoptosis of TE8 cells via the inhibition of EGF receptor signaling by ZD1839. ZD1839 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, and enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis via activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, and inactivation of Bcl-xL. Our results indicated that ZD1839 has anti-cancer properties against human esophageal cancer cells. ZD1839 also augmented the anti-cancer activity of TRAIL, even in TRAIL-resistant tumors. These results suggest that treatment with ZD1839 and TRAIL may have potential in the treatment of ESCC patients.

<ABSTRACT>
Low concentrations of HgCl2 elicited, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a transitory increase in the ATP level followed by a decrease of its concentration, until almost disappearance. At 1 microM HgCl2, the increase in ATP lasted for about 30 min, while at 10 microM the increase was only observed in the first 5 min of treatment. The initial burst of ATP was accompanied by a decrease in the level of hexose phosphates, whereas during the decrease of ATP an increase in the inosine and hexose phosphates levels took place. The treatment with HgCl2 inhibited the plasma membrane proton ATPase but not the activities of hexokinase or 6-phosphofructokinase.

<ABSTRACT>
The pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium channels comprise two subunits: SUR1 and Kir6.2. Two SUR1 mutations, A116P and V187D, reduce channel activity causing persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy. We investigated whether these mutations cause temperature sensitive misfolding. We show that the processing defect of these mutants is temperature sensitive and these two mutations disrupt the association between SUR1 and Kir6.2 by causing misfolding in SUR1 at 37 degrees C but can be rescued at 18 degrees C. Extensive electrophysiological characterization of these mutants indicated that low temperature largely, if not completely, corrects the folding defect of these two SUR1 mutants observed at 37 degrees C.

HER2 signaling downregulation by trastuzumab and suppression of the
PI3K/Akt pathway: an unexpected effect on TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 1;579(19):4149-58.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We investigated whether HER2 downregulation by trastuzumab modulates the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Interestingly, in contrast to increased response to TRAIL in SKBr3 cells, trastuzumab decreased the susceptibility of BT474 cells to TRAIL. This decrease was also observed after exogenous inhibition of PI3-K/Akt kinase, but not MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In BT474 cells, but not SKBr3 cells, inhibition of the HER2/phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway resulted in downregulation of the pro-apoptotic receptors TRAIL-receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1) and TRAIL-R2. TRAIL-induced caspase-8 activation, Bid processing, drop of DeltaPsi(m), and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage but not in caspase-9 activation, and these events were inhibited in HER2/PI3K/Akt-suppressed BT474 cells, which on the other hand exhibited downregulation of Bcl-xL and increased response to mitomycin C. We show that HER2/PI3K/Akt pathway may play a specific pro-apoptotic role in certain cell type by inducing TRAIL-R1 and -R2 expression and thereby enhancing responsiveness to TRAIL.

Identification of ADP-ribosylation site in human glutamate dehydrogenase
isozymes.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 1;579(19):4125-30.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
When the influence of ADP-ribosylation on the activities of the purified human glutamate dehydrogenase isozymes (hGDH1 and hGDH2) was measured in the presence of 100 microM NAD+ for 60 min, hGDH isozymes were inhibited by up to 75%. If incubations were performed for longer time periods up to 3 h, the inhibition of hGDH isozymes did not increased further. This phenomenon may be related to the reversibility of ADP-ribosylation in mitochondria. ADP-ribosylated hDGH isozymes were reactivated by Mg2+-dependent mitochondrial ADP-ribosylcysteine hydrolase. The stoichiometry between incorporated ADP-ribose and GDH subunits shows a modification of one subunit per catalytically active homohexamer. Since ADP and GTP had no effects on the extent of modification, it would appear that the ADP-ribosylation is unlikely to occur in allosteric sites. It has been proposed that Cys residue may be involved in the ADP-ribosylation of GDH, although identification of the reactive Cys residue has not been reported. To identify the reactive Cys residue involved in the ADP-ribosylation, we performed cassette mutagenesis at three different positions (Cys59, Cys119, and Cys274) using synthetic genes of hGDH isozymes. Among the Cys residues tested, only Cys119 mutants showed a significant reduction in the ADP-ribosylation. These results suggest a possibility that the Cys119 residue has an important role in the regulation of hGDH isozymes by ADP-ribosylation.

ASF/SF2 and SC35 regulate the glutamate receptor subunit 2 alternative
flip/flop splicing.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 1;579(19):4138-44.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The properties of the glutamate receptor subunits 1-4 (GluR1-4) are influenced by the alternative splicing of two homologous and mutually exclusive exons flip and flop. The flip form is most abundant during early development, while the flop form is dominant in adults. From transfections with a GluR2 mini-gene we show that flip is the preferred splice form in all tested cell lines, but coexpression of the SR-proteins ASF/SF2 and SC35 increases the flop to flip splice ratio. The increased flop incorporation depends on ASF/SF2- and SC35-dependent enhancer elements located in the flop exon, which stimulate the splicing between the flop exon and the preceding exon 13.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 1;579(19):4063-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
HAT-B is a yeast histone acetyltransferase composed of Hat1, Hat2 and Hif1 proteins. We demonstrate that a hat2 mutant or a hat1hat2 double mutant, but not a hat1 mutant, have an extended life-span. Transcriptome analysis shows that the single hat mutants are not very different from wild type. However, the comparison of the hat1 and hat2 transcriptomes shows that they are different. The hat1hat2 double mutant shows a transcriptional phenotype similar to that of the hat1 mutant but strongly enhanced. These results indicate that Hat2p could have additional functions in the cell to those of Hat1p.

Methylation of the guanidino group of arginine residues prevents
citrullination by peptidylarginine deiminase IV.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 1;579(19):4088-92.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Peptidylarginine deiminase IV (PAD IV) catalyzes the citrullination of Arg residues of proteins, such as histones. Suzuki et al. recently reported that haplotypes of the PAD IV gene are associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis. To investigate the mechanism of substrate specificity and inhibitors of PAD IV, a series of the Arg derivatives were synthesized and their reactivity to PAD IV examined. The results suggest that both imino and carboxyl groups are important in the molecular recognition of PAD IV and that methylation of the guanidino group prevents citrullination. In addition, the findings herein show that Bz-N(G)-monomethyl-Arg and Bz-N(G),N(G)-dimethyl-Arg specifically inhibit citrullination.

<ABSTRACT>
Gamma-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (ABALDH) from wild-type E. coli K12 was purified to apparent homogeneity and identified as YdcW by MS-analysis. YdcW exists as a tetramer of 202+/-29 kDa in the native state, a molecular mass of one subunit was determined as 51+/-3 kDa. Km parameters of YdcW for gamma-aminobutyraldehyde, NAD+ and NADP+ were 41+/-7, 54+/-10 and 484+/-72 microM, respectively. YdcW is the unique ABALDH in E. coli K12. A coupling action of E. coli YgjG putrescine transaminase and YdcW dehydrogenase in vitro resulted in conversion of putrescine into gamma-aminobutyric acid.

Thioredoxin overexpression in HT-1080 cells induced cellular senescence
and sensitization to gamma radiation.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 1;579(19):4055-62.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
An increment of thioredoxin-1 (TRX) is observed in many human primary cancers and appears to contribute to an increase of cell growth and a resistance to chemotherapy. On the contrary, when TRX was overexpressed in the HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells, the cell growth was retarded and chromosomal polyploidy and cellular senescence were induced. TRX-overexpression made HT-1080 cells resistant to an oxidative stress caused by H2O2 or paraquat. But these cells were significantly sensitive to ionizing radiation, showing an abrogation of the G2 checkpoint. Their DNA contents were twice of the controls and they expressed typical senescence markers. Their expression levels of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI) were about 2-3-fold higher than the control. Nevertheless, cyclin D1 and D3, which are negatively regulated by CDKIs, were also increased. Overall, in HT-1080 cells the TRX-overexpression created a state of cellular senescence caused by a simultaneous stimulation of the mitogen-activated pathways and an inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinases, which is known as a hypermitogenic arrest.

Folding and activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase mutants.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 1;579(19):4049-54.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) can easily be expressed in Escherichia coli and is catalytically active. Four phosphorylation sites are known in PKA (S10, S139, T197 and S338), and the isolated recombinant protein is a mixture of different phosphorylated forms. Obtaining uniformly phosphorylated protein requires separation of the protein preparation leading to significant loss in protein yield. It is found that the mutant S10A/S139D/S338D has similar properties as the wild-type protein, whereas additional replacement of T197 with either E or D reduces protein expression yield as well as folding propensity of the protein. Due to its high sequence homology to Akt/PKB, which cannot easily be expressed in E. coli, PKA has been used as a surrogate kinase for drug design. Several mutations within the ATP binding site have been described to make PKA even more similar to Akt/PKB. Two proteins with Akt/PKB-like mutations in the ATP binding site were made (PKAB6 and PKAB8), and in addition S10, S139 and S338 phosphorylation sites have been removed. These proteins can be expressed in high yields but have reduced activity compared to the wild-type. Proper folding of all proteins was analyzed by 2D 1H, 15N-TROSY NMR experiments.

<ABSTRACT>
We report the identification of a novel two-component system in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We show that the putative histidine kinase with the genomic locus tag Rv3220c is able to self-phosphorylate in the presence of Mg2+/ATP and subsequently transfer the phosphoryl group to a novel response regulator PdtaR. This creates a biochemical link between the two proteins and establishes a newly identified two component system, which acts at the level of transcriptional antitermination. We also suggest that this system has potential for the development of lead compounds for inhibition of phosphotransfer.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is commonly diagnosed late due to its deep location and vague symptoms. To identify biomarkers for early NPC diagnosis, secreted proteomes of two NPC cell lines were analyzed. Proteins in the NPC cell-line cultured media were systematically identified by SDS-PAGE combined with MALDI-TOF MS. Twenty-three proteins were found in cultured media from both NPC cell lines. Among them, fibronectin, Mac-2 binding protein (Mac-2 BP), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) were further confirmed by Western blot analysis. These three proteins were highly expressed in NPC biopsies, but weakly or not expressed in normal nasopharyngeal tissues. The serum levels of the three proteins were significantly higher in NPC patients (n = 46) than in normal controls (n = 47) (p < 0.01). NPC nude mice model (n = 9) also showed elevated levels of serum Mac-2 BP and PAI-1 compared with tumor-free mice (n = 9) (p < 0.01). Systematic analysis of cancer cell-secreted proteomes combined with animal tumor models can be a feasible, convenient strategy for searching multiple potential tumor markers. Furthermore, our work shows that fibronectin, Mac-2 BP, and PAI-1 may be potential markers for diagnosis of NPC.

Analysis of secreted proteins from Aspergillus flavus.

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3153-61.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
MS/MS techniques in proteomics make possible the identification of proteins from organisms with little or no genome sequence information available. Peptide sequences are obtained from tandem mass spectra by matching peptide mass and fragmentation information to protein sequence information from related organisms, including unannotated genome sequence data. This peptide identification data can then be grouped and reconstructed into protein data. In this study, we have used this approach to study protein secretion by Aspergillus flavus, a filamentous fungus for which very little genome sequence information is available. A. flavus is capable of degrading the flavonoid rutin (quercetin 3-O-glycoside), as the only source of carbon via an extracellular enzyme system. In this continuing study, a proteomic analysis was used to identify secreted proteins from A. flavus when grown on rutin. The growth media glucose and potato dextrose were used to identify differentially expressed secreted proteins. The secreted proteins were analyzed by 1- and 2-DE and MS/MS. A total of 51 unique A. flavus secreted proteins were identified from the three growth conditions. Ten proteins were unique to rutin-, five to glucose- and one to potato dextrose-grown A. flavus. Sixteen secreted proteins were common to all three media. Fourteen identifications were of hypothetical proteins or proteins of unknown functions. To our knowledge, this is the first extensive proteomic study conducted to identify the secreted proteins from a filamentous fungus.

Chromatofocusing fractionation and two-dimensional difference gel

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3183-92.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The technical challenge to analysis of the serum proteome is that the serum proteins are present at unequal concentrations. A few are so dominant, such as serum albumin and immunoglobulins, that they mask detection of other proteins. Because of these high abundance proteins, current technologies, while theoretically capable of analyzing protein amounts spanning four orders of magnitude, are only able to analyze proteins ranging over two orders of magnitude and cannot analyze the lower abundance proteins that may be the next biomarkers and drug targets. To facilitate the identification of low abundance proteins, we fractionated serum samples from patients with prostate cancer and patients with benign prostate hyperplasia using anion displacement liquid chromatofocusing chromatography, which separates proteins by a pH gradient and a positively charged column. Differential expression of proteins from fractions was then determined and identified by IEF gels and 2-D DIGE. Results demonstrate improved resolution of proteins within the chosen pH gradient when compared to the unfractionated samples. Several proteins that were differentially expressed in serum from patients with prostate cancer were identified in the fractionated serum. Three of these proteins, squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (SCCA1), calgranulin B, and haptoglobin-related protein, are present in the serum at levels below the classical protein level of mg/mL. SCCA1 is normally expressed in serum at ng/mL levels, and calgranulin B is an intracellular protein. Our results demonstrate that the use of anion displacement liquid chromatofocusing chromatography may reduce the complexity of the serum proteome by separating proteins into distinct pH ranges, and facilitate the identification of low abundance proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
A comparative analysis among Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the other four yeasts Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces lactis, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Yarrowia lipolytica is presented. The broad evolutionary range spanned by the organisms allows to quantitatively demonstrate novel evolutionary effects in protein complexes. The evolution rates within cliques of interlinked proteins are found to bear strong multipoint correlations, witnessing a cooperative coevolution of complex subunits. The coevolution is found to be largely independent of the tendency of the subunits to have similar abundances.

We invite comment upon an experiment to locate proteomics on the WWW using a software tool called the IssueCrawler. We call our research "sociomics" because, like the bioscience omics, it is a semi-automated, computerised approach to the global analysis of data, whose computerised results can be integrated towards the development of a new "systems sociology" approach to the study of society. Our findings are that proteomics on the web is a scale-free network whose nodes display considerable "dynamic range".

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3048-59.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Articular cartilage is composed of cells and an extracellular matrix. The chondrocyte is the only cell type present in mature cartilage, and it is important in the control of cartilage integrity. There is currently a great lack of knowledge about the chondrocyte proteome. To solve this deficiency, we have obtained the first reference map of the human normal articular chondrocyte. Cells were isolated from cartilages obtained from autopsies without history of joint disease. Cultured cells were used to obtain protein extracts which were resolved by 2-DE and visualized by silver nitrate or CBB staining. Almost 200 spots were excised from the gels and analyzed using MALDI-TOF or MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. The analysis leads to the identification of 136 spots that represent 93 different proteins. A significant proportion of proteins are involved in cell organization (26%), energy (16%), protein fate (14%), metabolism (12%), and cell stress (12%). From all the identified proteins, annexins, vimentin, transgelin, destrin, cathepsin D, heat shock protein 47, and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase were more abundant in chondrocytes than in other types of mesenchymal cells such as Jurkat-T cells. As metabolic program of chondrocytes is altered in osteoarthritis and other rheumatic diseases, this proteomic map is an important tool for future studies on these pathologies.

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3105-15.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
DIGE is a powerful tool for measuring changes in protein expression between samples. Here we assess the assumptions of normality and heterogeneity of variance that underlie the univariate statistical tests routinely used to detect proteins with expression changes. Furthermore, the technical variance experienced in a multigel experiment is assessed here and found to be reproducible within- and across-sample types. Utilising the technical variance measured, a power study is completed for several "typical" fold changes in expression commonly used as thresholds by researchers. Based on this study using DeCyder, guidance is given on the number of gel replicates that are needed for the experiment to have sufficient sensitivity to detect expression changes. A two-dye system based on utilising just Cy3 and Cy5 was found to be more reproducible than the three-dye system. A power and cost-benefit analysis performed here suggests that the traditional three-dye system would use fewer resources in studies where multiple samples are compared. Technical variance was shown to encompass both experimental and analytical noise and thus is dependent on the analytical software utilised. Data is provided as a resource to the community to assess alternative software and upgrades.

Carbonylation of milk powder proteins as a consequence of processing
conditions.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3097-104.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
During industrial treatments, milk proteins could be oxidatively modified, thus leading to the formation of modified/oxidised amino acid residues. The apparition of such modified residues may contribute to the formation of new immunologically reactive structures. Some of these adducts could, in an advanced stage, lead to cross-linked protein species whose proteolytic susceptibility would be drastically decreased. Such protein species, that are resistant to digestion, could also constitute major food allergens. Therefore, these oxidative protein modifications tend to increase the natural allergenicity of milk proteins. For these reasons, monitoring milk protein oxidative modifications could be very useful regarding both product quality and allergenicity issues. In the present paper, we highlight, using different analytical approaches, the preferential carbonylation of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg) during industrial treatments of milk. This result is particularly interesting since native beta-Lg represents one of the major milk allergens.

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3120-30.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The availability of whole genome sequences has enabled the application of powerful tools for assaying global expression patterns in environmentally relevant bacteria such as Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. A large number of genes in prokaryote genomes, including MR-1, have been annotated as hypothetical, indicating that no similar protein has yet been identified in other organisms. Using high-sensitivity MS coupled with accurate mass and time (AMT) tag methodology, 1078 tryptic peptides were collectively detected in MR-1 cultures, 671 of which were unique to their parent protein. Using only these unique tryptic peptides and a minimum of two peptides per protein, we identified, with high confidence, the expression of 258 hypothetical proteins. These proteins ranged from 3.5 to 139 kDa, with 47 being 100 amino acid residues or less. Using a combination of information including detection in cells grown under specific culture conditions, presence within a specific cell fraction, and predictive algorithms such as PSORT and PSORT-B, possible/plausible functions are proposed for some hypothetical proteins. Further, by applying this approach a number of proteins were found not only to be expressed, but only expressed under certain culturing conditions, thereby suggesting function while at the same time isolating several proteins to distinct locales of the cell. These results demonstrate the utility of the AMT tag methodology for comprehensive profiling of the microbial proteome while confirming the expression of a large number of hypothetical genes.

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3193-204.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Several studies have been published in which holistic approaches were used to characterise the proteome and transcriptome of human platelets. The key intent being that a deeper understanding of the normal and aberrant physiological functions of platelets can only be achieved if most biomolecular building blocks are mapped. Here we present the application of recently developed novel technologies that overcome some of the shortcomings of gel-based proteomics. Central in our approach is the so-called combined fractional diagonal chromatography (COFRADIC)-technology in which sets of representative peptides are sorted in a diagonal RP chromatographic system through a specific modification of their side chain. In this study we combined three different COFRADIC sorting techniques to analyse the proteome of human platelets. Methionyl, cysteinyl and amino terminal peptides were isolated and analysed by MS/MS. Merging the peptide identifications obtained after database searching resulted in a core set of 641 platelet proteins, which comprises the largest set identified today. In comparison to previously published platelet proteomes, we identified 404 novel platelet proteins containing a high number of hydrophobic membrane proteins and hypothetical proteins. Furthermore we discuss the observed characteristics and potential benefits of each of the different COFRADIC technologies for proteome analysis and highlight important issues that need to be considered when searching sequence databases using data obtained in peptide-centric, non-gel proteomics studies.

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3137-41.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Selective activation of T helper subsets 1 (Th1) and 2 (Th2) plays a crucial role in different pathological conditions. Th1 cell response is involved in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as type II diabetes and multiple sclerosis, and Th2 cell response in pathogenesis of allergy and asthma. Cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) is one of the key factors in the differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells into Th1 cells. In this study we used 2-DE and MS to find and identify IL-12 regulated proteins in human CD4(+) T cells. In total, 42 protein spots were found to be differentially expressed following IL-12 stimulation, of which 22 were up- and 20 down-regulated. Among the upregulated proteins there are a multifunctional cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor and a known IL-12 target gene Programmed cell death 4. Downregulated proteins include p21-activated kinase 2 and its upstream GTPase Cdc42. Compared to previous reports our analysis provides a new view on the IL-12 induced changes on CD4(+) T cells underscoring the importance of creating and combining the data generated at various levels to build a comprehensive view of a given biological process of the cell.

Peptidomics summarizes technologies for visualization, quantitation, and identification of the low-molecular-weight proteome (<15 kDa), the "peptidome." We analyzed all four HUPO specimens (EDTA plasma, citrate plasma, heparin plasma, and serum) from African- and Asian-American donors and compared them to in-house collected Caucasian specimens. One main finding focuses on the most suitable method of plasma specimen collection. Gentle platelet removal from plasma samples is beneficial for improved specificity. Platelet contamination or activation of platelets by low temperature prior to their removal leads to distinct and multiple peptide signals in plasma samples. Two different specimen collection protocols for platelet-poor plasma are recommended. Further emphasis is placed on the differences between plasma and serum on a peptidomic level. A large number of peptides, many of them in rather high abundance, are only present in serum and not detectable in plasma. This ex vivo generation of multiple peptides hampers discovery efforts and is caused by a variety of factors: the release of platelet-derived peptides, other peptides derived from cellular components or the clot, enzymatic activities of coagulation cascades, and other proteases. We conclude that specimen collection is a crucial step for successful peptide biomarker discovery in human blood samples. For analysis of the low-molecular-weight proteome, we recommend the use of platelet-depleted EDTA or citrate plasma.

Immunoassay and antibody microarray analysis of the HUPO Plasma Proteome
Project reference specimens: systematic variation between sample types and
calibration of mass spectrometry data.

<ABSTRACT>
Four different immunoassay and antibody microarray methods performed at four different sites were used to measure the levels of a broad range of proteins (N = 323 assays; 39, 88, 168, and 28 assays at the respective sites; 237 unique analytes) in the human serum and plasma reference specimens distributed by the Plasma Proteome Project (PPP) of the HUPO. The methods provided a means to (1) assess the level of systematic variation in protein abundances associated with blood preparation methods (serum, citrate-anticoagulated-plasma, EDTA-anticoagulated-plasma, or heparin-anticoagulated-plasma) and (2) evaluate the dependence on concentration of MS-based protein identifications from data sets using the HUPO specimens. Some proteins, particularly cytokines, had highly variable concentrations between the different sample preparations, suggesting specific effects of certain anticoagulants on the stability or availability of these proteins. The linkage of antibody-based measurements from 66 different analytes with the combined MS/MS data from 18 different laboratories showed that protein detection and the quality of MS data increased with analyte concentration. The conclusions from these initial analyses are that the optimal blood preparation method is variable between analytes and that the discovery of blood proteins by MS can be extended to concentrations below the ng/mL range under certain circumstances. Continued developments in antibody-based methods will further advance the scientific goals of the PPP.

Coordinated synthesis of the two ClpB isoforms improves the ability of
Escherichia coli to survive thermal stress.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4235-41.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Eubacteria synthesize a full-length (ClpB95) and a N-terminally truncated (ClpB80) version of the ClpB disaggregase owing to the presence of a translation initiation site within the clpB transcript. Why these two isoforms have been evolutionary conserved is poorly understood. Here, we constructed a series of E. coli strains and plasmids allowing production of the ClpB95/ClpB80 pair, ClpB95 alone, or ClpB80 alone from near physiological concentrations to a 6-10-fold excess over normal cellular levels. We found that although overexpressed ClpB95 or ClpB80 can independently restore basal thermotolerance to DeltaclpB cells, strains expressing ClpB80 from the clpB chromosomal locus do not exhibit increased resistance to thermal killing at 50 degrees C relative to clpB null cells. Furthermore, synthesis of physiological levels of ClpB95 is less effective than coordinated expression of ClpB95/ClpB80 in protecting E. coli from thermal killing. These results provide an explanation for the conservation of the two ClpB isoforms in eubacteria and are consistent with the fact that wild type E. coli maintains the ClpB80 to ClpB95 ratio at a nearly constant value of 0.4-0.5 under a variety of stress conditions.

<ABSTRACT>
Transport by ABC proteins requires a cycle of ATP-driven conformational changes of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). We compare three molecular dynamics simulations of dimeric MJ0796: with ATP was present at both NBDs; with ATP at one NBD but ADP at the other; and without any bound ATP. In the simulation with ATP present at both NBDs, the dimeric protein interacts with the nucleotides in a symmetrical manner. However, if ADP is present at one binding site then both NBD-NBD and protein-ATP interactions are enhanced at the opposite site.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The heat shock protein 90 co-chaperone p23 has recently been shown to be up-regulated in cancer cells and down-regulated in atheroschlerotic plaques. We found that p23 is degraded during apoptosis induced by several stimuli, including Fas and TNFalpha-receptor activation as well as staurosporine treatment. Caspase inhibition protected p23 from degradation in several cell lines. In addition, recombinant caspase-3 and 8 cleaved p23 at Asp 142 generating a degradation product of 18 kDa as seen in apoptotic cells. Truncated p23 is further degraded in a proteasome dependent process during apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that the anti-aggregating activity of truncated p23 was reduced compared to full length p23 indicating that caspase mediated p23 degradation contributes to protein destabilisation in apoptosis.

<ABSTRACT>
In this study, we isolated and pharmacologically characterized the first alpha-like toxin from the venom of the scarcely studied Iranian scorpion Odonthobuthus doriae. The toxin was termed OD1 and its primary sequence was determined: GVRDAYIADDKNCVYTCASNGYCNTECTKNGAESGYCQWIGRYGNACWCIKLPDEVPIRIPGKCR. Using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique, the pharmacological effects of OD1 were studied on three cloned voltage-gated Na+ channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes (Na(v)1.2/beta1, Na(v)1.5/beta1, para/tipE). The inactivation process of the insect channel, para/tipE, was severely hampered by 200 nM of OD1 (EC50 = 80+/-14 nM) while Na(v)1.2/beta1 still was not affected at concentrations up to 5 microM. Na(v)1.5/beta1 was influenced at micromolar concentrations.

Probing cytoskeleton modulation by optical biosensors.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 1;579(19):4175-80.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
This paper reported the use of resonant waveguide grating biosensors for studying the cytoskeleton structure in cells. This was achieved by measuring the changes in mass within the bottom portion of cells upon exposure to saponin in the absence and presence of cytoskeleton modulators. Treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells with saponin led to a dose-dependent and dynamic mass changes. When a higher concentration of saponin (> 60 microg/ml) was used, a net loss in mass was observed. This is probably resulted from the diffusion of soluble intracellular materials away from the bottom portion of cells after pore formation in the cell plasma membranes by saponin. The pretreatment of cells with actin disruption agents, cytochalasin B and latrunculin A, led to significantly increased loss in cell mass induced by either 75 or 125 microg/ml saponin. These results suggested that optical biosensors provide an attractive means to study the cytoskeleton structure and screen modulators that affect the cytoskeleton structure.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 1;579(19):4165-74.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Arabidopsis thaliana metal tolerance protein 1 (MTP1) of the cation diffusion facilitator family of membrane transport proteins can mediate the detoxification of Zn in Arabidopsis and yeast. Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing AtMTP1 accumulate more Zn than oocytes expressing the AtMTP1(D94A) mutant or water-injected oocytes. An AtMTP1-GFP fusion protein localizes to the vacuolar membrane in root and leaf cells. The analysis of Arabidopsis transformed with a promoter-GUS construct suggests that AtMTP1 is not produced throughout the plant, but primarily in the subpopulation of dividing, differentiating and expanding cells. RNA interference-mediated silencing of AtMTP1 causes Zn hypersensitivity and a reduction in Zn concentrations in vegetative plant tissues.

Immunoaffinity separation of plasma proteins by IgY microbeads: meeting
the needs of proteomic sample preparation and analysis.

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(13):3314-28.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Separation of complex protein mixtures that have a wide dynamic range of concentration, such as plasma or serum, is a challenge for proteomic analysis. Sample preparation to remove high-abundant proteins is essential for proteomics analysis. Immunoglobulin yolk (IgY) antibodies have unique and advantageous features that enable specific protein removal to aid in the detection of low-abundant proteins and biomarker discovery. This report describes the efficiency and effectiveness of IgY microbeads in separating 12 abundant proteins from plasma with an immunoaffinity spin column or LC column. The protein separation and sample preparation process was monitored via SDS-PAGE, 2-DE, LC-MS/MS, or clinical protein assays. The data demonstrate the high specificity of the protein separation, with removal of 95-99.5% of the abundant proteins. IgY microbeads against human proteins can also selectively remove orthologous proteins of other mammals such as mouse, rat, etc. Besides the specificity and reproducibility of the IgY microbeads, the report discusses the factors that may cause potential variations in protein separation such as protein-protein interactions (known as "Interactome"), binding and washing conditions of immunoaffinity reagents, etc. A novel concept of Seppromics is introduced to address methodologies and science of protein separation in a context of proteomics.

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(13):3501-5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
With the human Plasma Proteome Project (PPP) pilot phase completed, the largest and most ambitious proteomics experiment to date has reached its first milestone. The correspondingly impressive amount of data that came from this pilot project emphasized the need for a centralized dissemination mechanism and led to the development of a detailed, PPP specific data gathering infrastructure at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor as well as the protein identifications database project at the European Bioinformatics Institute as a general proteomics data repository. One issue that crept up while discussing which data to store for the PPP concerns whether the raw, binary data coming from the mass spectrometers should be stored, or rather the more compact and already significantly processed peak lists. As this debate is not restricted to the PPP but relates to the proteomics community in general, we will attempt to detail the relative merits and caveats associated with centralized storage and dissemination of raw data and/or peak lists, building on the extensive experience gained during the PPP pilot phase. Finally, some suggestions are made for both immediate and future storage of MS data in public repositories.

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(13):3537-45.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The advent of high-throughput proteomics has enabled the identification of ever increasing numbers of proteins. Correspondingly, the number of publications centered on these protein identifications has increased dramatically. With the first results of the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project being analyzed and many other large-scale proteomics projects about to disseminate their data, this trend is not likely to flatten out any time soon. However, the publication mechanism of these identified proteins has lagged behind in technical terms. Often very long lists of identifications are either published directly with the article, resulting in both a voluminous and rather tedious read, or are included on the publisher's website as supplementary information. In either case, these lists are typically only provided as portable document format documents with a custom-made layout, making it practically impossible for computer programs to interpret them, let alone efficiently query them. Here we propose the proteomics identifications (PRIDE) database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride) as a means to finally turn publicly available data into publicly accessible data. PRIDE offers a web-based query interface, a user-friendly data upload facility, and a documented application programming interface for direct computational access. The complete PRIDE database, source code, data, and support tools are freely available for web access or download and local installation.

<ABSTRACT>
Plasma is one of the best studied compartments in the human body and serves as an ideal body fluid for the diagnosis of diseases. This report provides a detailed functional annotation of all the plasma proteins identified to date. In all, gene products encoded by 3778 distinct genes were annotated based on proteins previously published in the literature as plasma proteins and the identification of multiple peptides from proteins under HUPO's Plasma Proteome Project. Our analysis revealed that 51% of these genes encoded more than one protein isoform. All single nucleotide polymorphisms involving protein-coding regions were mapped onto the protein sequences. We found a number of examples of isoform-specific subcellular localization as well as tissue expression. This database is an attempt at comprehensive annotation of a complex subproteome and is available on the web at http://www.plasmaproteomedatabase.org.

<ABSTRACT>
Blood is divided in two compartments, namely, plasma and cells. The latter contain red blood cells, leukocytes, and platelets. From a descriptive medical discipline, hematology has evolved towards a pioneering discipline where molecular biology has permitted the development of prognostic and diagnostic indicators for disease. The recent advance in MS and protein separation now allows similar progress in the analysis of proteins. Proteomics offers great promise for the study of proteins in plasma/serum, indeed a number of proteomics databases for plasma/serum have been established. This is a very complex body fluid containing lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, vitamins, nucleic acids, hormones, and proteins. About 1500 different proteins have recently been identified, and a number of potential new markers of diseases have been characterized. Here, examples of the enormous promise of plasma/serum proteomic analysis for diagnostic/prognostic markers and information on disease mechanism are given. Within the blood are also a large number of different blood cell types that potentially hold similar information. Proteomics of red blood cells, until now, has not improved our knowledge of these cells, in contrast to the major progresses achieved while studying platelets and leukocytes. In the future, proteomics will change several aspects of hematology.

A novel strategy consisting of cleavable Isotope-Coded Affinity Tag (cICAT) combined with MASCOT Distiller was evaluated as a tool for the quantification of proteins in "abnormal" patient plasma, prepared by pooling samples from patients with acute stroke. Quantification of all light and heavy cICAT-labelled peptide ion pairs was obtained using MASCOT Distiller combined with a proprietary software. Peptides displaying differences were selected for identification by MS. These preliminary results show the promise of our approach to identify potential biomarkers.

Web-based data warehouse on gene expression in human colorectal cancer.

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3066-78.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Based on biomedical literature databases, we tried a first step for constructing a gene expression "data warehouse" specific to human colorectal cancer (CRC). Results of genome-wide transcriptomic research were available from 12 studies, using various technologies, namely, SAGE, cDNA and oligonucleotide arrays, and adaptor-tagged amplification. Three studies analyzed CRC cell lines and nine studies of human samples. The total number of patients was 144. Out of 982 up- or down-regulated genes, 863 (88%) were found to be differentially expressed in a single study, 88 in two studies, 22 in three studies, 7 in four studies, and only 2 genes in six studies. Eight large-scale proteomics studies were published in CRC, using 2-D-, SDS- or free-flow electrophoresis, involving only 11 patients. Out of 408 differentially expressed proteins, 339 (83%) were found to be differentially expressed only in a single study, 16 in three studies, 10 in four studies, 3 in five, and 1 in eight studies. Confirmation at proteome level of results obtained with large-scale transcriptomics studies was possible in 25%. This proportion was higher (67%) for reproducing proteome results using transcriptomics technologies. Obviously, reproducibility and overlapping between published gene expression results at proteome and transcriptome level are low in human CRC. Thus, the development of standardized processes for collecting samples, storing, retrieving, and querying gene expression data obtained with different technologies is of central importance in translational research.

Translational repression by the cis-acting element of structure-anchored
repression (CAESAR) of human ctgf/ccn2 mRNA.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Jul 4;579(17):3751-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The cis-acting element of structure-anchored repression (CAESAR) is a post-transcriptional regulatory element of gene expression, which is located in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the human ccn2 gene (ctgf/ccn2). In this report, the repression mechanism of CAESAR, as well as the structural requirement, was investigated. Removal of minor stem-loops from CAESAR resulted in proportional attenuation of the repressive function, whereas removal of the single bulge or modification of primary nucleotide sequence did not affect its functionality. In light of functional mechanism, CAESAR exerted no significant effects on stability or nuclear export of the cis-linked mRNA. However, this element significantly interfered with the association of such mRNA on ribosome and slowed down the translation process thereafter in vitro. A translation repression mechanism by RNA secondary structure to determine the basal ctgf/ccn2 expression level was uncovered herein.

A wide range of protein isoforms in serum and plasma uncovered by a
quantitative intact protein analysis system.

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(13):3343-52.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have implemented an orthogonal 3-D intact protein analysis system (IPAS) to quantitatively profile protein differences between human serum and plasma. Reference specimens consisting of pooled Caucasian-American serum, citrate-anticoagulated plasma, and EDTA-anticoagulated plasma were each depleted of six highly abundant proteins, concentrated, and labeled with a different Cy dye (Cy5, Cy3, or Cy2). A mixture consisting of each of the labeled samples was subjected to three dimensions of separation based on charge, hydrophobicity, and molecular mass. Differences in the abundance of proteins between each of the three samples were determined. More than 5000 bands were found to have greater than two-fold difference in intensity between any pair of labeled specimens by quantitative imaging. As expected, some of the differences in band intensities between serum and plasma were attributable to proteins related to coagulation. Interestingly, many proteins were identified in multiple fractions, each exhibiting different pI, hydrophobicity, or molecular mass. This is likely reflective of the expression of different protein isoforms or specific protein cleavage products, as illustrated by complement component 3 precursor and clusterin. IPAS provides a high resolution, high sensitivity, and quantitative approach for the analysis of serum and plasma proteins, and allows assessment of PTMs as a potential source of biomarkers.

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(13):3367-75.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Prefractionations of proteins prior to their proteolysis, chromatography, and MS/MS analyses help reduce complexity and increase the yield of protein identifications. A number of methods were evaluated here for prefractionating serum samples distributed to the participating laboratories as part of the human Plasma Proteome Project. These methods include strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography, slicing of SDS-PAGE gel bands, and liquid-phase IEF of the proteins. The fractionated proteins were trypsinized and the resulting peptides were resolved and analyzed by multidimensional protein identification technology coupled to IT MS/MS. The MS/MS spectra were clustered, combined, and searched against the IPI protein databank using Pep-Miner. The identification results were evaluated for the efficacy of the different prefractionation methodologies to identify larger numbers of proteins at higher confidence and to achieve the best coverage of the proteins with the identified peptides. Prefractionation based on SCX resulted in the largest number of identified proteins, followed by gel slices and then the liquid-phase IEF. An important observation was that each of the methods revealed a set of unique proteins, some identified with high confidence. Therefore, for comprehensive identification of the serum proteins, several different prefractionation approaches should be used in parallel.

<ABSTRACT>
We have investigated the serum proteome of Han-nationality Chinese by using shotgun strategy. A complete proteomics analysis was performed on two reference specimens from a total of 20 healthy donors, in which each sample was made from ten-pooled male or female serum, respectively. The methodology used encompassed (1) removal of six high-abundant proteins; (2) tryptic digestion of low- and high-abundant proteins of serum; (3) separation of peptide mixture by RP-HPLC followed by ESI-MS/MS identification. A total of 944 nonredundant proteins were identified under a stringent filter condition (X(corr) > or = 1.9, > or = 2.2, and > or = 3.75, < or = C(n) > or = 0.1, and R(sp) > or = 4.0) in both pooled male and female samples, in which 594 and 622 entire proteins were found, respectively. Compared with the total 3020 protein identifications confirmed by more than one laboratory or more than one specimen in HUPO Plasma Proteome Project (PPP) participating laboratories recently, 206 proteins were identified with at least two distinct peptides per protein and 185 proteins were considered as high-confidence identification. Moreover, some lower abundance serum proteins (ng/mL range) were detected, such as complement C5 and CA125, routinely used as an ovarian cancer marker in plasma and serum. The resulting nonredundant list of serum proteins would add significant information to the knowledge base of human plasma proteome and facilitate disease markers discovery.

Efficient prefractionation of low-abundance proteins in human plasma and
construction of a two-dimensional map.

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(13):3386-96.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Human plasma is the most clinically valuable specimen, containing not only a dynamic concentration range of protein components, but also several groups of high-abundance proteins that seriously interfere with the detection of low-abundance potential biomarker proteins. To establish a high-throughput method for efficient depletion of high-abundance proteins and subsequent fractionation, prior to molecular analysis of proteins, we explored how coupled immunoaffinity columns, commercially available as multiple affinity removal columns (MARC) and free flow electrophoresis (FFE), could apply to the HUPO plasma proteome project. Here we report identification of proteins and construction of a human plasma 2-DE map devoid of six major abundance proteins (albumin, transferrin, IgG, IgA, haptoglobin, and antitrypsin) using MARC. The proteins were identified by PMF, matching with various internal 2-DE maps, resulting in a total of 144 nonredundant proteins that were identified from 398 spots. Tissue plasminogen activator, usually present at 10-60 ng/mL plasma, was also identified, indicative of a potentially low-abundance biomarker. Comparison of representative 2-D gel images of three ethnic groups (Caucasian, Asian-American, African-American) plasma exhibited minor differences in certain proteins between races and sample pretreatment. To establish a throughput fractionation of plasma samples by FFE, either MARC flow-through fractions or untreated samples of Korean serum were subjected to FFE. After separation of samples on FFE, an aliquot of each fraction was analyzed by 1-D gel, in which MARC separation was a prerequisite for FFE work. Thus, a working scheme of MARC --> FFE --> 1-D PAGE --> 2-D-nanoLC-MS/MS may be considered as a widely applicable standard platform technology for fractionation of complex samples like plasma.

<ABSTRACT>
MS/MS and associated database search algorithms are essential proteomic tools for identifying peptides. Due to their widespread use, it is now time to perform a systematic analysis of the various algorithms currently in use. Using blood specimens used in the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project, we have evaluated five search algorithms with respect to their sensitivity and specificity, and have also accurately benchmarked them based on specified false-positive (FP) rates. Spectrum Mill and SEQUEST performed well in terms of sensitivity, but were inferior to MASCOT, X!Tandem, and Sonar in terms of specificity. Overall, MASCOT, a probabilistic search algorithm, correctly identified most peptides based on a specified FP rate. The rescoring algorithm, PeptideProphet, enhanced the overall performance of the SEQUEST algorithm, as well as provided predictable FP error rates. Ideally, score thresholds should be calculated for each peptide spectrum or minimally, derived from a reversed-sequence search as demonstrated in this study based on a validated data set. The availability of open-source search algorithms, such as X!Tandem, makes it feasible to further improve the validation process (manual or automatic) on the basis of "consensus scoring", i.e., the use of multiple (at least two) search algorithms to reduce the number of FPs. complement.

<ABSTRACT>
Dissipation of excess excitation energy within the photosystem II light-harvesting antenna (LHCII) by non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is an important photoprotective process in plants. An update to a hypothesis for the mechanism of NPQ [FEBS Letters 292, 1991] is presented. The impact of recent advances in understanding the structure, organisation and photophysics of LHCII is assessed. We show possible locations of the predicted regulatory and quenching pigment-binding sites in the structural model of the major LHCII. We suggest that NPQ is a highly regulated concerted response of the organised thylakoid macrostructure, which can include different mechanisms and sites at different times.

<ABSTRACT>
Novel catechin derivatives obtained from grape procyanidins and l-cysteine scavenge free radicals by hydrogen atom donation, rather than electron transfer, and reduce cell viability in A375 and M21 melanoma cells. In particular, 4beta-(S-cysteinyl)epicatechin 3-O-gallate has a free radical scavenging capacity as strong as that of tea (-)-epigallocatechin gallate and causes a significant S-phase cell-cycle arrest in both cell lines at doses higher than 100 microM. The other cysteinyl compounds do not affect normal cell cycle distribution. The gallate derivative also induces apoptosis in melanoma cells more strongly than the other derivatives and the parent (-)-epicatechin do. The gallate compound seems to trigger nuclear condensation and fragmentation, which is confirmed by DNA laddering. Interestingly, they do not induce apoptosis in keratinocytes (HaCaT).

The N-terminal domain of Escherichia coli ClpB enhances chaperone
function.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4242-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
ClpB/Hsp104 collaborates with the Hsp70 system to promote the solubilization and reactivation of proteins that misfold and aggregate following heat shock. In Escherichia coli and other eubacteria, two ClpB isoforms (ClpB95 and ClpB80) that differ by the presence or absence of a highly mobile 149-residues long N-terminus domain are synthesized from the same transcript. Whether and how the N-domain contributes to ClpB chaperone activity remains controversial. Here, we show that, whereas fusion of a 20-residues long hexahistidine extension to the N-terminus of ClpB95 interferes with its in vivo and in vitro activity, the same tag has no detectable effect on ClpB80 function. In addition, ClpB95 is more effective than ClpB80 at restoring the folding of the model protein preS2-beta-galactosidase as stress severity increases, and is superior to ClpB80 in improving the high temperature growth and low temperature recovery of dnaK756 DeltaclpB cells. Our results are consistent with a model in which the N-domain of ClpB95 maximizes substrate processing under conditions where the cellular supply of free DnaK-DnaJ is limiting.

<ABSTRACT>
The regulatory Ni-Fe hydrogenase (RH) from Ralstonia eutropha which forms a [HoxBC]2 complex functions as a hydrogen sensor under aerobic conditions. We have studied a novel Strep-tag isolate of the RH large subunit, HoxC(ST), which lacks the Fe-S clusters of HoxB, allowing for structure determination of the catalytic site by X-ray absorption spectroscopy both at the Ni and, for the first time, also at the Fe K-edge. This technique, together with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, revealed a Ni-Fe site with [O1(CysS)2Ni(II)(mu-SCys)2Fe(II)(CN)2(CO)] structure in about 50% of HoxC(ST) and a [(CysS)2Fe(II)(CN)2(CO)] site lacking Ni in the remainder protein. Possibly both sites may be intermediates in the maturation process of the RH.

<ABSTRACT>
Active Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) plays an important role in the process of MLC phosphorylation and consecutive smooth muscle contraction. Here, we propose a mathematical model of a detailed kinetic scheme describing interactions among Ca2+, CaM and MLCK and taking into account eight different aggregates. The main model result is the prediction of the Ca2+ dependent active form of MLCK, which is in the model taken as proportional to the concentration of Ca4CaM.MLCK complex. Wegscheider's condition is additionally applied as a constraint enabling the prediction of some parameter values that have not yet been obtained by experiments.

Prediction of methylated CpGs in DNA sequences using a support vector

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
DNA methylation plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression. The most common type of DNA modification consists of the methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide. At the present time, there is no method available for the prediction of DNA methylation sites. Therefore, in this study we have developed a support vector machine (SVM)-based method for the prediction of cytosine methylation in CpG dinucleotides. Initially a SVM module was developed from human data for the prediction of human-specific methylation sites. This module achieved a MCC and AUC of 0.501 and 0.814, respectively, when evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation. The performance of this SVM-based module was better than the classifiers built using alternative machine learning and statistical algorithms including artificial neural networks, Bayesian statistics, and decision trees. Additional SVM modules were also developed based on mammalian- and vertebrate-specific methylation patterns. The SVM module based on human methylation patterns was used for genome-wide analysis of methylation sites. This analysis demonstrated that the percentage of methylated CpGs is higher in UTRs as compared to exonic and intronic regions of human genes. This method is available on line for public use under the name of Methylator at http://bio.dfci.harvard.edu/Methylator/.

<ABSTRACT>
Centrins are members of the calcium-binding EF-hand protein superfamily which can be divided into two subfamilies, probably associated with different functions: one related to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii centrin, CrCenp, and the other, represented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae isoform, ScCdc31p. ESTs encoding the two isoforms (BeCen1 and BeCen3) from the chytridiomycete Blastocladiella emersonii were isolated, and expression of the CrCenp-type centrin, BeCen1, was analyzed throughout the fungus life cycle. Becen1 mRNA levels increase transiently during sporulation and protein levels present a similar pattern. Immunolocalization studies seem to localize BeCen1 at the basal body zone and in the cytoplasm surrounding the nuclear cap, a zoospore organelle.

Diclofenac attenuates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in colon cancer cells by
activation of NF-kappaB.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4213-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The dysregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and subsequent upregulation of beta-catenin response transcription (CRT) occur frequently in colon cancer cells. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can repress CRT in colorectal cancer, but little is known about the mechanism of action. We show that the NSAID diclofenac inhibits Wnt/beta-catenin signaling without altering the level of beta-catenin protein and reduces the expression of beta-catenin/TCF-dependent genes. Diclofenac induced the degradation of IkappaBalpha, which increased free nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) in cells. Also, the ectopic expression of p65, which is a component of NF-kappaB, suppressed CRT. Our findings suggest that diclofenac inhibits Wnt/beta-catenin signaling via the activation of NF-kappaB in colon cancer cells.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Advanced glycation end product (AGE)-their receptor (RAGE) and angiotensin II (AII) are implicated in diabetic retinopathy. However, a crosstalk between the two is not fully understood. In vivo, AGE injection stimulated RAGE expression in the eye of spontaneously hypertensive rats, which was blocked by an AII-type 1 receptor blocker, telmisartan. In vitro, AII-type 1 receptor-mediated reactive oxygen species generation elicited RAGE gene expression in pericytes through NF-kappaB activation. Further, AII augmented AGE-induced pericyte apoptosis, the earliest hallmark of diabetic retinopathy. Our present study may implicate a crosstalk between AGE-RAGE system and AII in diabetic retinopathy.

<ABSTRACT>
The 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase catalyzes the hydrolytic dechlorination of 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA via a two-step mechanism, namely nucleophilic aromatic substitution and ester hydrolysis. The mutation of an active-site Histidine residue has been shown to reduce the catalytic activity in both the substitution and subsequent hydrolysis steps. In this communication, we report a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulation of the potential of mean force for the substitution step, which confirms the increased barrier height in the H90Q mutant and provides evidence on the electrostatic influence of two active-site waters on the rate-limiting barrier.

Staphylococcal enterotoxin A modulates intracellular Ca2+ signal pathway
in human intestinal epithelial cells.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We demonstrate here that staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) induces an increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) in human intestinal epithelial cells and the [Ca2+]i is released from intracellular stores. SEA-induced increase of [Ca2+]i was clearly inhibited by treatment with a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine and guanidine. Intestinal epithelial cells express endothelial NOS in resting cell condition, and express inducible NOS after stimulating with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. TNF-alpha-pretreated cells showed a significant increase in [Ca2+]i that was also inhibited by the NOS inhibitor. These results suggest that SEA modulated [Ca2+]i signal is dependent on NOS expression in human intestinal epithelial cells.

Involvement of HP1alpha protein in irreversible transcriptional
inactivation by antiestrogens in breast cancer cells.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4278-86.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Resistance to 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (OHT), which appears in breast cancer cells after long-term antiestrogen treatment, may involve irreversible changes of gene expression. We previously developed a MCF-7 derived cell line (MVLN), in which OHT rapidly and irreversibly inactivates the expression of an estrogen-regulated luciferase transgene (Vit-tk-luciferase). In chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1alpha) was found to be associated with the Vit-tk-luciferase transgene, only when it was inactivated by OHT treatment. Chimeras composed of either HP1alpha or the Krupple-associated box (KRAB) module of KOX-1 protein (known to repress gene expression by recruitment of HP1 proteins), fused to the estrogen receptor (ER)-DNA binding domain (DBD) and the androgen receptor (AR)-ligand binding domain (LBD) were generated and appeared as potent transcriptional repressors. In stably transfected MVLN cells, irreversible inactivation of the luciferase transgene expression obtained with HP1alpha-ER(DBD)-AR(LBD) was partial, whereas inactivation obtained with KRAB-ER(DBD)-AR(LBD) was comparable to that obtained with OHT, although with a slower kinetics. Altogether, these data suggest that HP1alpha is involved in the silencing effects associated with long-term OHT treatments.

Superoxide determines nitric oxide uptake rate by vascular smooth muscle
cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4349-54.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Nitric oxide (NO) is generated in endothelial cells, which diffuses to vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), activates soluble guanylyl cyclase, and leads to blood vessel dilation. However, this scenario does not explain how SMCs are capable of competing with erythrocytic hemoglobin for NO in vivo. Here, we have developed a competition experiment to determine the NO uptake rate by SMCs and demonstrated that the SMC-NO uptake rate is positively dependent on intracellular superoxide levels. In addition, the superoxide-elicited NO influx is able to enhance cGMP production in SMCs. Our findings imply that vascular SMCs, in vivo, may use superoxide to compete with erythrocytic hemoglobin for NO and obtain the NO bioactivity.

<ABSTRACT>
The glycoproteome is a major subproteome present in human plasma. In this study, we isolated and characterized approximately 150 glycoproteins from the human plasma and serum samples provided by HUPO using a multilectin affinity column. The corresponding tryptic digest was separated by RP-HPLC coupled to an IT mass spectrometer (3-D LCQ). Also in this study, a new system, namely an Ettan MDLC system coupled to a linear ITLTQ, was compared with the previous LCQ platform and gave a greater number of protein identifications, as well as better quality. When we compared the composition of the glycoproteomes for the plasma and serum samples there was a close correlation between the samples, except for the absence of fibrinogen from the identified-protein list in the latter sample, which was presumably as a result of the clotting process. In addition, the analysis of the samples from three ethnic specimens, Caucasian American, Asian American, and African American, were very similar but showed a higher angiotensinogen plasma level and a lower histidine-rich glycoprotein level in Caucasian American samples, and a lower vitronectin level in African American blood samples.

<ABSTRACT>
The proteome of a HUPO human serum reference sample was analyzed using multidimensional separation techniques at both the protein and the peptide levels. To eliminate false-positive identifications from the search results, we employed a data filtering method using molecular weight (MW) correlations derived from denaturing 1-DE. First, the six most abundant serum proteins were removed from the sample using immunoaffinity chromatography. 1-DE was then used to fractionate the remaining serum proteins according to the MW. Gel bands were isolated and in-gel digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by 2-D LC/ESI-MS/MS. A SEQUEST search using the MS/MS results identified 494 proteins. Of these, 202 were excluded formally using protein data filtering as they were single-assignment proteins and their theoretical and electrophoretically-derived MWs did not correlate at high confidence. To evaluate this method, the results were compared with those of 1-D LC/MALDI-TOF/TOF and HUPO Plasma Proteome Project analyses. Our data filtering approach proved valuable in analysis of complex, large-scale proteomes such as human serum.

<ABSTRACT>
Based on the same HUPO reference specimen (C1-serum) with the six proteins of highest abundance depleted by immunoaffinity chromatography, we have compared five proteomics approaches, which were (1) intact protein fractionation by anion-exchange chromatography followed by 2-DE-MALDI-TOF-MS/MS for protein identification (2-DE strategy); (2) intact protein fractionation by 2-D HPLC followed by tryptic digestion of each fraction and microcapillary RP-HPLC/microESI-MS/MS identification (protein 2-D HPLC fractionation strategy); (3) protein digestion followed by automated online microcapillary 2-D HPLC (strong cation-exchange chromatography (SCX)-RPC) with IT microESI-MS/MS; (online shotgun strategy); (4) same as (3) with the SCX step performed offline (offline shotgun strategy) and (5) same as (4) with the SCX fractions reanalysed by optimised nanoRP-HPLC-nanoESI-MS/MS (offline shotgun-nanospray strategy). All five approaches yielded complementary sets of protein identifications. The total number of unique proteins identified by each of these five approaches was (1) 78, (2) 179, (3) 131, (4) 224 and (5) 330 respectively. In all, 560 unique proteins were identified. One hundred and sixty-five proteins were identified through two or more peptides, which could be considered a high-confidence identification. Only 37 proteins were identified by all five approaches. The 2-DE approach yielded more information on the pI-altered isoforms of some serum proteins and the relative abundance of identified proteins. The protein prefractionation strategy slightly improved the capacity to detect proteins of lower abundance. Optimising the separation at the peptide level and improving the detection sensitivity of ESI-MS/MS were more effective than fractionation of intact proteins in increasing the total number of proteins identified. Overall, electrophoresis and chromatography, coupled respectively with MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS and ESI-MS/MS, identified complementary sets of serum proteins.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Systematic detection of low-abundance proteins in human blood that may be putative disease biomarkers is complicated by an extremely wide range of protein abundances. Hence, depletion of major proteins is one potential strategy for enhancing detection sensitivity in serum or plasma. This study compared a recently commercialized HPLC column containing antibodies to six of the most abundant blood proteins ("Top-6 depletion") with either older Cibacron blue/Protein A or G depletion methods or no depletion. In addition, a prototype spin column version of the HPLC column and an alternative prototype two antibody spin column were evaluated. The HPLC polyclonal antibody column and its spin column version are very promising methods for substantially simplifying human serum or plasma samples. These columns show the lowest nonspecific binding of the depletion methods tested. In contrast other affinity methods, particularly dye-based resins, yielded many proteins in the bound fractions in addition to the targeted proteins. Depletion of six abundant proteins removed about 85% of the total protein from human serum or plasma, and this enabled 10- to 20-fold higher amounts of depleted serum or plasma samples to be applied to 2-D gels or alternative protein profiling methods such as protein array pixelation. However, the number of new spots detected on 2-D gels was modest, and most newly visualized spots were minor forms of relatively abundant proteins. The inability to detect low-abundance proteins near expected 2-D staining limits was probably due to both the highly heterogeneous nature of most plasma or serum proteins and masking of many low-abundance proteins by the next series of most abundant proteins. Hence, non2-D methods such as protein array pixelation are more promising strategies for detecting lower abundance proteins after depleting the six abundant proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
There is a substantial list of pre-analytical variables that can alter the analysis of blood-derived samples. We have undertaken studies on some of these issues including choice of sample type, stability during storage, use of protease inhibitors, and clinical standardization. As there is a wide range of sample variables and a broad spectrum of analytical techniques in the HUPO PPP effort, it is not possible to define a single list of pre-analytical standards for samples or their processing. We present here a compendium of observations, drawing on actual results and sound clinical theories and practices. Based on our data, we find that (1) platelet-depleted plasma is preferable to serum for certain peptidomic studies; (2) samples should be aliquoted and stored preferably in liquid nitrogen; (3) the addition of protease inhibitors is recommended, but should be incorporated early and used judiciously, as some form non specific protein adducts and others interfere with peptide studies. Further, (4) the diligent tracking of pre-analytical variables and (5) the use of reference materials for quality control and quality assurance, are recommended. These findings help provide guidance on sample handling issues, with the overall suggestion being to be conscious of all possible pre-analytical variables as a prerequisite of any proteomic study.

<ABSTRACT>
A novel strategy, termed protein array pixelation, is described for comprehensive profiling of human plasma and serum proteomes. This strategy consists of three sequential high-resolution protein prefractionation methods (major protein depletion, solution isoelectrofocusing, and 1-DE) followed by nanocapillary RP tryptic peptide separation prior to MS/MS analysis. The analysis generates a 2-D protein array where each pixel in the array contains a group of proteins with known pI and molecular weight range. Analysis of the HUPO samples using this strategy resulted in 575 and 2890 protein identifications from plasma and serum, respectively, based on HUPO-approved criteria for high-confidence protein assignments. Most importantly, a substantial number of low-abundance proteins (low ng/mL - pg/mL range) were identified. Although larger volumes were used in initial prefractionation steps, the protein identifications were derived from fractions equivalent to approximately 0.6 microL (45 microg) of plasma and 2.4 microL (204 microg) of serum. The time required for analyzing the entire protein array for each sample is comparable to some published shotgun analyses of plasma and serum proteomes. Therefore, protein array pixelation is a highly sensitive method capable of detecting proteins differing in abundance by up to nine orders of magnitude. With further refinement, this method has the potential for even higher capacity and higher throughput.

<ABSTRACT>
Proteomic profiling of accessible bodily fluids, such as plasma, has the potential to accelerate biomarker/biosignature development for human diseases. The HUPO Plasma Proteome Project pilot phase examined human plasma with distinct proteomic approaches across multiple laboratories worldwide. Through this effort, we confidently identified 3020 proteins, each requiring a minimum of two high-scoring MS/MS spectra. A critical step subsequent to protein identification is functional annotation, in particular with regard to organ systems and disease. Performing exhaustive literature searches, we have manually annotated a subset of these 3020 proteins that have cardiovascular-related functions on the basis of an existing body of published information. These cardiovascular-related proteins can be organized into eight groups: markers of inflammation and/or cardiovascular disease, vascular and coagulation, signaling, growth and differentiation, cytoskeletal, transcription factors, channels/receptors and heart failure and remodeling. In addition, analysis of the peptide per protein ratio for MS/MS identification reveals group-specific trends. These findings serve as a resource to interrogate the functions of plasma proteins, and moreover, the list of cardiovascular-related proteins in plasma constitutes a baseline proteomic blueprint for the future development of biosignatures for diseases such as myocardial ischemia and atherosclerosis.

<ABSTRACT>
We report on a multicenter analysis of HUPO reference specimens using SELDI-TOF MS. Eight sites submitted data obtained from serum and plasma reference specimen analysis. Spectra from five sites passed preliminary quality assurance tests and were subjected to further analysis. Intralaboratory CVs varied from 15 to 43%. A correlation coefficient matrix generated using data from these five sites demonstrated high level of correlation, with values >0.7 on 37 of 42 spectra. More than 50 peaks were differentially present among the various sample types, as observed on three chip surfaces. Additionally, peaks at approximately 9200 and approximately 15,950 m/z were present only in select reference specimens. Chromatographic fractionation using anion-exchange, membrane cutoff, and reverse phase chromatography, was employed for protein purification of the approximately 9200 m/z peak. It was identified as the haptoglobin alpha subunit after peptide mass fingerprinting and high-resolution MS/MS analysis. The differential expression of this protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis. These pilot studies demonstrate the potential of the SELDI platform for reproducible and consistent analysis of serum/plasma across multiple sites and also for targeted biomarker discovery and protein identification. This approach could be exploited for population-based studies in all phases of the HUPO PPP.

<ABSTRACT>
Characterization of the human blood plasma proteome is critical to the discovery of routinely useful clinical biomarkers. We used an accurate mass and time (AMT) tag strategy with high-resolution mass accuracy cLC-FT-ICR MS to perform a global proteomic analysis of pilot study samples as part of the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project. HUPO reference serum and citrated plasma samples from African Americans, Asian Americans, and Caucasian Americans were analyzed, in addition to a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory reference serum and plasma. The AMT tag strategy allowed us to leverage two previously published "shotgun" proteomics experiments to perform global analyses on these samples in triplicate in less than 4 days total analysis time. A total of 722 (22% with multiple peptide identifications) International Protein Index redundant proteins, or 377 protein families by ProteinProphet, were identified over the six individual HUPO serum and plasma samples. The samples yielded a similar number of identified redundant proteins in the plasma samples (average 446 +/- 23) as found in the serum samples (average 440 +/- 20). These proteins were identified by an average of 956 +/- 35 unique peptides in plasma and 930 +/- 11 unique peptides in serum. In addition to this high-throughput analysis, the AMT tag approach was used with a Z-score normalization to compare relative protein abundances. This analysis highlighted both known differences in serum and citrated plasma such as fibrinogens, and reproducible differences in peptide abundances from proteins such as soluble activin receptor-like kinase 7b and glycoprotein m6b. The AMT tag strategy not only improved our sample throughput but also provided a basis for estimated quantitation.

<ABSTRACT>
The human Plasma Proteome Project (PPP) is a large-scale collaboration between many laboratories. One of the most demanding tasks in the PPP involved the analysis of very large amounts of raw MS/MS data produced by the participants. The main approach for managing this task was letting the participants analyze their own data and submit the results to the central PPP repository as lists of identified proteins and peptides. To complement this distributed approach, we also performed centralized analysis of the raw MS/MS data provided by the participants. Due to the data redundancy inherent in such a project, centralized analysis has the potential to reduce the computational effort by reducing redundancy before the analysis. Centralized analysis can also unify the process and take advantage of data sharing among laboratories to improve protein identification and validation. The process we employed included removing low-quality spectra, clustering spectra by mutual similarity, and applying uniform peptide and protein identification procedures. To demonstrate the process, we analyzed 5.28 million MS/MS spectra derived by eight laboratories from tryptic peptides of serum and plasma proteins.

Differences among techniques for high-abundant protein depletion.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(13):3304-13.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The need to identify protein or peptide biomarkers via readily available biological samples like serum, plasma, or cerebrospinal fluid is often hindered by a few particular proteins present at relatively high concentrations. The ability to remove these proteins specifically, reproducibly, and with high selectivity is increasingly important in proteomic studies, and success in this procedure is leading to an ever-increasing list of lower abundant proteins being identified in these biological fluids. The current work addresses some of the potential problems in depleting proteins in typical biomarker studies, including nonspecific binding during depletion procedures and whether low molecular weight (LMW) species bind to the column in a so-called "sponge" effect caused by the ability of albumin or other high-abundant proteins to bind peptides or protein fragments. LC-MS/MS methods were applied to the comparative analysis of an IgG-based immunodepletion method and a Cibacron blue (CB)-dye-based method, for specificity of removing targeted proteins (binding fraction), as well as for assessing efficiency of target removal. This analysis was extended to examine the effects of repeated use of materials (cycles of binding and elution), in order to assess potential for carryover of one sample to the next. Capacity studies and efficiency of protein removal from the serum samples were followed for the IgG-based system using both immunochemical assays (ELISA) as well as LC-MS/MS methods. Additionally, the IgG-based system was further characterized for the removal of LMW polypeptides by nonspecific binding. We conclude that the IgG-based system provided effective removal of targeted proteins, with minimal carryover, high longevity, and minimal nonspecific binding. Significant differences are noted between the depletion techniques employed, and this should be considered based on the expectations set during experimental design.

Application of 2-D free-flow electrophoresis/RP-HPLC for proteomic
analysis of human plasma depleted of multi high-abundance proteins.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(13):3402-13.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Free-flow electrophoresis (FFE) and rapid (6 min) RP-HPLC was used to fractionate human citrate-treated plasma. Prior to analysis, the six most abundant proteins in plasma were removed by immunoaffinity chromatography; both depleted plasma and the fraction containing the six abundant proteins depleted were taken for MS-based analysis. Fractionated proteins were digested with trypsin and the generated peptides were subjected to MS-based peptide sequencing. To date, 78 plasma proteins have been unambiguously identified by manual validation from 16% (15/96 FFE total fractions) of the collected FFE pools; 55 identifications were based on > or = 2 tryptic peptides and 23 using single peptides. The molecular weight range of proteins and peptides isolated by this method ranged from approximately 190 K (e.g., Complement C3 and C4) to approximately 4-6 K (e.g., CRISPP and Apolipoprotein C1). This FFE/RP-HPLC approach reveals low-abundance proteins and peptides (e.g., L-Selectin approximately 17 ng/mL and the cancer-associated SCM-recognition, immunodefense suppression, and serine protease protection peptide (CRISPP) at approximately 0.5-1 ng/mL), where CRISPP was found in association with alpha-1-antitrypsin as a non-covalent complex, in the fraction containing the depleted high-abundance proteins. In contrast to shotgun proteomic approaches, the FFE/RP-HPLC method described here allows the identification of potentially interesting peptides to be traced back to their protein of origin, and for the first time, has confirmed the "protein sponge" hypothesis where the 35 residue CRISPP polypeptide is non-covalently complexed with the major circulating plasma protein alpha-1-antitrypsin.

Urocortin 1 and Urocortin 2 induce macrophage apoptosis via CRFR2.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4259-64.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Macrophages undergo apoptosis as a mechanism of regulating their activation and the inflammatory reaction. Macrophages express the Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Receptor-2 (CRFR2) the endogenous agonists of which, the urocortins, are also present at the site of inflammation. We have found that urocortins induced macrophage apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner via CRFR2. In contrast to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced apoptosis, the pro-apoptosis pathway activated by urocortins involved the pro-apoptotic Bax and Bad proteins and not nitric oxide, JNK and p38MAPK characteristic of LPS. In conclusion, our data suggest that endogenous CRFR2 ligands exert an anti-inflammatory effect via induction of macrophage apoptosis.

Selective inhibition of divergent seryl-tRNA synthetases by serine

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4344-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Seryl-tRNA synthetases (SerRSs) fall into two distinct evolutionary groups of enzymes, bacterial and methanogenic. These two types of SerRSs display only minimal sequence similarity, primarily within the class II conserved motifs, and possess distinct modes of tRNA(Ser) recognition. In order to determine whether the two types of SerRSs also differ in their recognition of the serine substrate, we compared the sensitivity of the representative methanogenic and bacterial-type SerRSs to serine hydroxamate and two previously unidentified inhibitors, serinamide and serine methyl ester. Our kinetic data showed selective inhibition of the methanogenic SerRS by serinamide, suggesting a lack of mechanistic uniformity in serine recognition between the evolutionarily distinct SerRSs.

<ABSTRACT>
Gymnemic acids (GA) inhibited rabbit muscle glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity. Binding of GA to GAPDH was observed by surface plasmon resonance measurement. Incubation of GAPDH with GA induced a smearing of the GAPDH band in SDS-PAGE. The GA-induced smearing was diminished by prior incubation of GA with gamma-cyclodextrin or by GA treatment with NAD. GA treatment did not affect the electrophoretic mobility of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and dehydrogenase. GA treatment diminished the GAPDH band detected by an antibody to phosphoserine, but did not affect the phosphoserine bands of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and dehydrogenase. These results indicated that GA specifically induced dephosphorylation of GAPDH.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4367-73.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cellobiohydrolase A (CbhA) from Clostridium thermocellum is composed of an N-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain 4 (CBD4), an immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig), a glycoside hydrolase 9 (GH9), X1(1) and X1(2) domains, a CBD3, and a dockerin domain. All domains, except the Ig, bind Ca2+. The following constructs were made: X1(2), X1(1)X1(2), CBD3, X1(1)X1(2)-CBD3, Ig, GH9, Ig-GH9, Ig-GH9-X1(1)X1(2), and Ig-GH9-X1(1)X1(2)-CBD3. Interactions between domains in (1) buffer, (2) with Ca2+, or (3) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were studied by differential scanning calorimetry. Thermal unfoldings of all constructs were irreversible. Calcium increased T(d) and cooperativity of unfolding. Multi-domain constructs exhibited more cooperative unfolding in buffer and in the presence of EDTA than did individual domains. They denatured by mechanism simpler than expected from their modular architecture. The results indicate that domain coupling in thermophilic proteins constitutes a significant stabilizing factor.

<ABSTRACT>
A sensor of blue light using FAD (BLUF) protein is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) based new class blue-light sensory flavoprotein. The BLUF domain of AppA was reconstituted in vitro from apoprotein and flavin adenine dinucleotide, flavin adenine mononucleotide or riboflavin. The light-induced FTIR spectra of the domain reconstituted from various flavins and the 13C-labeled apoprotein showed that identical light-induced structural changes occur in both the flavin chromophore and protein for the signaling state in all of the reconstituted holoproteins. The results showed that an adenosine 5'-dinucleotide moiety is not required for signaling-state formation in a BLUF domain.

Structure-activity relationship of alginate oligosaccharides in the
induction of cytokine production from RAW264.7 cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Guluronate and mannuronate oligomers with various degree of polymerization were prepared from polyguluronate (PG) and polymannuronate (PM) with an alginate lyase from a Pseudoalteromonas sp., and their activities to induce cytokine secretion from mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells were examined. Enzymatically depolymerized unsaturated alginate oligomers induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha secretion from RAW264.7 cells in a structure-depending manner, while the activities of saturated alginate oligomers prepared by acid hydrolysis were fairly low or only trace levels. These results suggest that unsaturated end-structure of alginate oligomers was important for the TNF-alpha-inducing activity. Among the unsaturated guluronate (G3-G9) and mannuronate (M3-M9) oligomers, G8 and M7 showed the most potent activity, respectively. Bio-Plex assay revealed that interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 secretion from RAW264.7 cells were also induced by unsaturated alginate oligomers with similar structure-activity relationship profiles as seen in TNF-alpha, and the most potent activities were observed with G8 and M7. These results suggest that G8 and M7 may have the most suitable molecular size or entire structural conformation as stimulant for cytokine secretion. Since antibodies to Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 effectively inhibited the G8- and M7-induced production of TNF-alpha, these alginate oligomers may stimulate innate immunity through the pattern recognition receptors on macrophages similar to microbial products.

p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) upregulates catalase levels
in response to low dose H2O2 treatment through enhancement of mRNA
stability.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4402-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
V79 fibroblasts were repetitively stressed through multiple exposures to a low dose (30 microM) H2O2 in culture for 4 weeks. Catalase activity, protein levels and mRNA levels increased markedly (5-6-fold) during this time and these augmentations were inhibited by the simultaneous presence of SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK). p38MAPK became dually phosphorylated and ATF-2, a p38MAPK substrate also became increasingly phosphorylated over the repetitive stress period. Short interfering RNA that induced effective silencing of p38MAPK, was used to silence p38MAPK in V79 fibroblasts. Silencing of p38MAPK drastically hindered the elevation in catalase (protein and mRNA) levels observed after a single low dose (50 microM) of H2O. The rise in catalase mRNA levels induced by low concentration (single and multiple dose) H2O2 treatment was established to be unconnected with transcriptional upregulation but was brought forth primarily by an enhancement in catalase mRNA stability through the action of p38MAPK. Therefore, our data strongly indicate that activation of p38MAPK is a key controlling step in the upregulation of catalase levels by low dose H2O2 treatment.

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4449-53.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Innate immune collectins, such as surfactant protein D (SP-D), contain fibrillar collagen-like regions and globular carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs). SP-D recognizes carbohydrate arrays present on microbial surfaces via its CRDs, agglutinates microbes and enhances their phagocytosis. In contrast, adaptive immune proteins such as immunoglobulins (Igs) recognize pathogens via binding to specific antigens. Here we show that: SP-D binds various classes of immunoglobins, including IgG, IgM, IgE and secretory IgA, but not serum IgA; the globular domains of SP-D bind both the Fab and Fc domains of IgG; SP-D recognizes IgG via calcium-dependent protein-protein interactions, aggregates IgG-coated beads and enhances their phagocytosis by murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. Therefore, we propose that SP-D effectively interlinks innate and adaptive immune systems.

Autocrine signaling of platelet-derived growth factor regulates disabled-2

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4395-401.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is involved in megakaryocytopoiesis and is secreted into the culture medium during megakaryocytic differentiation of human leukemic cells. We investigate whether PDGF plays a role in the regulation of the adapter protein Disabled-2 (DAB2) that expresses abundantly in platelets and megakaryocytes. Western blot analysis revealed that conditioned medium from 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated, megakaryocytic differentiating K562 cells upregulated DAB2 expression. DAB2 induction and megakaryocytic differentiation was abrogated when cells were co-treated with the PDGF receptor inhibitor STI571 or when the conditioned medium was derived from TPA-plus STI571-treated cells. Although the level of PDGF mRNA was not altered by STI571, an approximate 44% decrease in PDGF in the conditioned medium was observed. Consistent with these findings, interfering PDGF signaling by PDGF neutralization antibody or dominant negative PDGF receptors attenuated DAB2 expression. Accordingly, transfection of an expression plasmid encoding secreted PDGF upregulated DAB2. This study shows for the first time that PDGF autocrine signaling regulates DAB2 expression during megakaryocytic differentiation.

<ABSTRACT>
Here, we present the crystal structure of the family 31 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) of beta-1,3-xylanase from Alcaligenes sp. strain XY-234 (AlcCBM31) determined at a resolution of 1.25A. The AlcCBM31 shows affinity with only beta-1,3-xylan. The AlcCBM31 molecule makes a beta-sandwich structure composed of eight beta-strands with a typical immunoglobulin fold and contains two intra-molecular disulfide bonds. The folding topology of AlcCBM31 differs from that of the large majority of other CBMs, in which eight beta-strands comprise a beta-sandwich structure with a typical jelly-roll fold. AlcCBM31 shows structural similarity with CBM structures of family 34 and family 9, which also adopt structures based on immunoglobulin folds.

<ABSTRACT>
TAP, an ABC transporter in the ER membrane, provides antigenic peptides derived from proteasomal degradation to MHC class I molecules for inspection by cytotoxic T lymphocytes at the cell surface so as to trace malignant or infected cells. To investigate the minimal number of transmembrane segments (TMs) required for assembly of the TAP complex based on hydrophobicity algorithms and alignments with other ABC transporters we generated N-terminal truncation variants of human TAP1 and TAP2. As a result, a 6+6 TM core-TAP complex represents the minimal functional unit of the transporter, which is essential and sufficient for heterodimer assembly, peptide binding, and peptide translocation into the ER. The TM1 of both, core-TAP1 and core-TAP2 are critical for heterodimerization of the complex.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In isolated potato tuber mitochondria, palmitic acid (PA) can induce a H+ leak inhibited by GTP in the phosphorylating (state 3) respiration but not in the resting (state 4) respiration. The PA-induced H+ leak is constant when state 3 respiration is decreased by an inhibition of the succinate uptake with n-butyl malonate (nBM). We show that the efficiency of inhibition by GTP is decreased when state 3 respiration is progressively inhibited by antimycin A (AA) and is restored following subsequent addition of nBM. We propose that in phosphorylating potato tuber mitochondria, the redox state of ubiquinone, which can antagonistically be varied with AA and nBM, modulates inhibition of the PA-activated UCP-sustained H+ leak by GTP.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The N-terminal domain (N-domain) of the firefly luciferase from Photinus pyraris has weak luminescence activity, and shows a unique light emitting profile with very long rise time of more than several minutes. Through a sensitive assay of the reaction intermediate luciferyl-adenylate (LH2-AMP), we found that the slow increase in the N-domain luminescence faithfully reflected the concentration of dissociated LH2-AMP. No such correlation was observed for wild-type or mutant enzymes with short rise time, except one with longer rise time. The results suggest that the C-terminal domain plays an indispensable role in efficiently coupling adenylation and oxidative steps.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Pleurotus ostrearus proteinase A inhibitor 1 (POIA1), which was discovered as a protease inhibitor, is unique in that it shows sequence homology to the propeptide of subtilisin, which functions as an intramolecular of a cognate protease. In this study, we demonstrate that POIA1 can function as an intramolecular chaperone of subtilisin by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The specific cleavage between POIA1 and the mature region of subtilisin BPN' occurred in a refolding process of a chimera protein, and Bacillus cells transformed with a chimera gene formed a halo on a skim milk plate. The mutational analyses of POIA1 in the chimera protein suggested that the tertiary structure of POIA1 is required for such a function, and that an increase in its ability to bind to subtilisin BPN' makes POIA1 a more effective intramolecular chaperone.

Signaling pathways of magnolol-induced adrenal steroidogensis.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4337-43.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
This study focused on identifying the signalling mediating the effect of magnolol on corticosterone production. Magnolol-induced corticosterone production was completely inhibited by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-inhibitor PD98059, tyrosine kinase (TK)-inhibitor genistein or Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2)-inhibitor AG490, suggesting that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and JAK2 are both involved in this signaling cascade. Further, magnolol induced the transient phosphorylation of MEK, ERK, cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB) and the expression of 32 and 30 kDa steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) in a time-dependent manner. Inhibition of TK or JAK2 activities blocked magnolol-induced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, again supporting the upstream role of JAK2. The activation of JAK2 or MEK apparently mediated the magnolol-induced phosphorylation of CREB and the upregulation of StAR. These findings demonstrate a novel pathway for magnolol to induce the expression of StAR, which regulates the rate-limiting step in sterodiogenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
Amphibian skin is a rich resource of antimicrobial peptides, like maximins and maximin Hs from frog Bombina maxima. Novel cDNA clones encoding a precursor protein, which comprises a novel maximin peptide (maximin 9) and reported maximin H3, were isolated from two constructed skin cDNA libraries of B. maxima. The predicted primary structure of maximin 9 is GIGRKFLGGVKTTFRCGVKDFASKHLY-NH2. A surprising substitution is at position 16, with a free cysteine in maximin 9 rather than usual conserved glycine in other reported maximins. Maximin 9, the homodimer form and its Cys16 to Gly16 mutant were synthesized and their antimicrobial activities were evaluated. Unlike previously reported maximin 3, the tested bacterial and fungal strains were resistant to maximin 9, its homodimer and the Cys16 to Gly16 mutant (with MICs>100 microM). On the other hand, interestingly, while eight clinical Mollicutes strains were generally resistant to maximin 9 homodimer and its Cys16 to Gly16 mutant, most of them are sensitive to maximin 9 at a peptide concentration of 30 microM, especially in the presence of dithiothreitol. These results indicate that the presence of a reactive Cys residue in maximin 9 is important for its antimycoplasma activity. The diversity of antimicrobial peptide cDNA structures encountered in B. maxima skin cDNA libraries and the antimicrobial specificity differences of the peptides may reflect well the species' adaptation to the unique microbial environments.

A model system for [NiFe] hydrogenase maturation studies: Purification of
an active site-containing hydrogenase large subunit without small subunit.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4292-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The large subunit HoxC of the H2-sensing [NiFe] hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha was purified without its small subunit. Two forms of HoxC were identified. Both forms contained iron but only substoichiometric amounts of nickel. One form was a homodimer of HoxC whereas the second also contained the Ni-Fe site maturation proteins HypC and HypB. Despite the presence of the Ni-Fe active site in some of the proteins, both forms, which lack the Fe-S clusters normally present in hydrogenases, cannot activate hydrogen. The incomplete insertion of nickel into the Ni-Fe site provides direct evidence that Fe precedes Ni in the course of metal center assembly.

Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2866-75.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Plasmodesmata are channels that bridge the cell walls of plant cells, allowing regulated transport of molecules between neighbouring cells. We have used a proteomic strategy to identify putative plasmodesmata-associated proteins in the giant-celled green alga Chara corallina. Proteins were extracted from the plasmodesmata-rich nodal complexes and the middle of the long internodal cells, which do not contain plasmodesmata. Comparison of protein spot patterns generated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of both the soluble and cell wall fractions from the two cell types was done. Fifty-eight spots that were common to the nodal and internodal soluble fractions were analysed by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry, and peptide mass fingerprint data were used to search the database. Matches were made to four of these spots, in each case to housekeeping proteins. Further, a number of nodal specific spots were identified, 11 from the soluble fraction and nine from the wall fraction. These spots were excised from the gels and analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to obtain peptide sequence. Database searches suggest that these spots include homologues to previously identified plasmodesmata-associated proteins cp-wap13 and heat shock cognate 70, as well as RNA-binding proteins, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A and a beta-1,3-glucanase. Several spots remained unidentified providing exciting new candidate plasmodesmata-associated proteins.

Optimization of IPG strip equilibration for the basic membrane protein
mABC1.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Jul;5(11):2892-5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Many proteins with extreme physical properties, including basic and acidic proteins, membrane proteins, and very large proteins, present specific challenges to 2-DE separation. Using a pressure-blotting approach, we demonstrate that a basic integral membrane protein, mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette protein 1 (mABC1), focuses in the IPG strip, but fails to enter into the 2-D SDS-PAGE gel. Through modifying the equilibration conditions between the IPG strip and 2nd dimension, we demonstrate that only by increasing both the volume (from 3 to 6 mL for a 7-cm strip) and SDS concentration (from 2 to 10%) of the equilibration buffer is migration of mABC1 into the 2nd dimension achieved. While 2-DE remains one of the core separation technologies of proteomic analysis, proteins that are extremely basic, hydrophobic, or of large mass present significant challenges to 2-DE separation due to aggregation, oxidation, precipitation, and the physical limitations of the 1-D IPG strip. Since the advent of commercially available IPG strips, numerous groups have experimented with IEF conditions using various detergents alone or in combination, alternative denaturants, and thiol oxidation agents to improve protein focusing. Effective 2-DE separation of membrane proteins has been affected dramatically by these advances in protein solubilization, as well as improvements in isolation of membranes, delipidation, and active in-gel rehydration. Since the development of commercially available basic IPG strips, the most significant advance in the separation of basic proteins has been the introduction of hydroxyethyldisulfides, either alone or in combination with DTT. While hydrophobic proteins were once virtually absent from the 2-D gel, and basic proteins were only visible as dense streaks, now many groups are undertaking large-scale analyses of membranes and basic proteins. Using this base of experimental tools, we embarked on a proteomic analysis of cardiac mitochondrial membranes, hoping to combine the knowledge gained from ongoing targeted protein chemistry and molecular biology studies with a broader-based proteomic analysis. Of particular interest is the inner mitochondrial membrane protein mABC1 (mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette protein 1), which may play a significant role in cardioprotection as part of the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Therefore, in designing our 2-DE approach, it was crucial to ensure that mABC1 is focused, observable, and quantifiable, despite being an integral membrane protein of pI 9.37.

<ABSTRACT>
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is an important diagnostic source to investigate cellular and molecular changes in the course of lung disorders. The pattern of soluble proteins in BALF obtained from patients at different stages of respiratory disorders may provide deeper insights in the molecular mechanisms of the disease. We used surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MS) for differential protein display combined with reversed-phase chromatography and subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-MS or nanoliquid chromatography MS/MS analysis for protein identification to compare the protein pattern of BALF samples obtained from ten smokers suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), eight clinically asymptomatic smokers, and eight nonsmokers without pulmonary disease. In this context, we were able to identify small proteins and peptides, either differentially expressed or secreted in the course of COPD or in a direct response to cigarette smoke. The concentrations of neutrophil defensins 1 and 2, S100A8 (calgranulin A), and S100A9 (calgranulin B) were elevated in BALFs of smokers with COPD when compared to asymptomatic smokers. Increased concentrations in S100A8 (Calgranulin A), salivary proline-rich peptide P-C, and lysozyme C were detected in BALFs of asymptomatic smokers when compared to nonsmokers, whereas salivary proline-rich peptide P-D and Clara cell phospholipid-binding protein (CC10) were reduced in their concentration. The identified proteins and peptides might be useful in the future as diagnostic markers for smoke-induced lung irritations and COPD.

A proteomic method for the analysis of changes in protein concentrations
in response to systemic perturbations using metabolic incorporation of
stable isotopes and mass spectrometry.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3563-70.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
While several techniques exist for assessing quantitative differences among proteomes representing different cell states, methods for assessing how these differences are mediated are largely missing. We present a method that allows one to differentiate between cellular processes, such as protein synthesis, degradation and PTMs which affect protein concentrations. An induced systemic perturbation of a cell culture was coupled to a replacement of the growth medium to one highly enriched in the stable isotope 15N. The relative abundance of the 15N- and 14N-enriched forms of proteins, isolated from cell cultures harvested at time points following the onset of the perturbation, were determined by MS. Alterations in protein synthesis and degradation were quantified by comparing proteins isolated from perturbed and unperturbed cultures, respectively. The method was evaluated by subjecting HeLa cells to heat stress. As expected, a number of known heat shock proteins (Hsp) increased in concentration during heat stress. For Hsp27, increased de novo synthesis accounted for the concentration increase, while for Hsp70, decreased degradation accounted for the increase. A protein that was detected only after prolonged heat stress, vimentin, was not primarily synthesized de novo, but appeared rather as a result of PTM.

Two-dimensional benzyldimethyl-n-hexadecylammonium chloride/SDS-PAGE for

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3581-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Despite the importance of membranes in any living system, the global analysis of membrane subproteomes is still a common obstacle. In particular, the widely used 2-DE technique consisting of IEF in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension has some major drawbacks regarding the separation of hydrophobic proteins. Therefore, we applied an alternative electrophoretic technique for separating membrane proteins: two-dimensional BAC/SDS electrophoresis (2-DB) using the cationic detergent benzyldimethyl-n-hexadecylammonium chloride in the first and the anionic detergent SDS in the second dimension. The use of 2-DB resulted in an improved separation of hydrophobic proteins. Thus, extremely hydrophobic proteins such as cytochrome-c oxidase subunit I with a grand average hydrophobicity (GRAVY) index of 0.74 and a total of 12 known transmembrane domains (TMD) or Sec61alpha with a GRAVY index of 0.56 and a total of ten known TMD could be identified by MS/MS analyses of protein spots derived from 2-DB gels.

A proteomic analysis of cold stress responses in rice seedlings.

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(12):3162-72.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Using proteomic analysis, an investigation aimed at a better understanding of the molecular adaptation mechanisms of cold stress was carried out in rice (Oryza sativa). The seedlings were exposed to a progressively low temperature stress treatment from normal temperature to 15, 10, and 5 degrees C. Proteins were extracted from the leaves collected from both control and stressed seedlings. By fractionation, approximately 1700 protein spots were separated and visualized on CBB-stained 2-D gels. Sixty protein spots were found to be up-regulated in responding to the progressively low temperature stress and displayed different dynamic patterns. As an initial work, 41 of these proteins were identified using MALDI-TOF MS or ESI/MS/MS. These cold responsive proteins, besides two proteins of unknown function, include four factors of protein biosynthesis, four molecular chaperones, two proteases, and eight enzymes involved in biosynthesis of cell wall components, seven antioxidative/detoxifying enzymes, and proteins linked to energy pathway, as well as a protein involved in signal transduction. The functional proteomes illuminate the facts, at least in plant cell, that protein quality control mediated by chaperones and proteases and enhancement of cell wall components play important roles in tolerance to cold stress. Using TargetP program, the subcellular localization of the identified proteins was analyzed. Proteins (43.9%) were predicted to be located in the chloroplasts, implying that chloroplast proteome is virtually subjective to cold stress. The physiological implications, revealed from the experimental data, are discussed in context of a complex metabolic network in plant cells responsive to cold stress.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cell surface molecules are not only important for cell-cell interactions but also useful for a marker to define cell types and differentiation stages. Unlike hematopoietic system in which numerous such antigens have been identified, only a few cell surface molecules have been used to define differentiation stage of hepatocytes. In order to identify such cell surface molecules, we performed DNA microarray analysis using mRNA from fetal hepatocytes in E12.5 and E17.5 mice and cDNAs encoding a membrane protein were selected. Northern blot analysis was employed to confirm the genes upregulated during maturation of fetal hepatocytes and neuritin, a GPI-anchored protein, was found as a membrane protein expressed in hepatocytes, but not in nonparenchymal cells. Its expression increased along with liver development and the maximum expression was achieved from the neonatal to adult stage. The neuritin protein was localized in sinusoidal lumen of hepatocytes in adult liver. Partial hepatectomy transiently downregulated the expression of neuritin. The expression of neuritin mRNA in C/EBPalpha deficient liver was reduced to about 50% of that of wild type mice. Thus, neuritin expression is well correlated to the maturation of hepatocytes and can be a useful tool to define the differentiation stage of hepatocytes.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The incidence of type I allergic disorders has been increasing worldwide, particularly, the hypersensitivity to food. We first showed that apple condensed tannin (ACT) intake would inhibit the development of the oral sensitization and that the inhibition could correlate with the rise in the population of TCR(gamma)delta-T cells in the intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) using W/W(V) mice and B10A mice which were ovalbumin (OVA)-orally sensitized. Serum OVA-specific immunoglobulin E and immunoglobulin G1 titers in the OVA-orally sensitized W/W(V) and B10A mice ad libitium fed ACT were extremely inhibited compared to those of the control. The ACT intakes of OVA-sensitized W/W(V) and B10A mice inhibited the immediate reduction of the body temperature or the rise in serum histamine induced by active systemic anaphylaxis. The proportions of the TCR(gamma)delta-T cells in the IEL of the OVA-orally sensitized W/W(V) and B10A mice ad libitium fed ACT were significantly greater than that in the controls. Furthermore, ACT feeding by itself could induce the rise in the percentage of the TCR(gamma)delta-T cells among the IEL of the W/W(V) and B10A mice. This suggests that the ACT intake may prevent the development of food allergies and this effect could be correlated with the rise in the percentage of TCR(gamma)delta-T cells among the IEL.

<ABSTRACT>
Two homologous Nicotiana tabacum genes NtTOM1 and NtTOM3 have been identified. These genes encode polypeptides with amino acid sequence similarity to Arabidopsis thaliana TOM1 and TOM3, which function in parallel to support tobamovirus multiplication. Simultaneous RNA interference against NtTOM1 and NtTOM3 in N. tabacum resulted in nearly complete inhibition of the multiplication of Tomato mosaic virus and other tobamoviruses, but did not affect plant growth or the ability of Cucumber mosaic virus to multiply. As TOM1 and TOM3 homologues are present in a variety of plant species, their inhibition via RNA interference should constitute a useful method for generating tobamovirus-resistant plants.

<ABSTRACT>
STAT4 is a transcription factor activated in response to IL-12, and is involved in Th1 cell development. The molecular mechanisms controlling the transcription of the STAT4 gene are however, unclear. Sequence comparison of the 5' flanking regions of human, mouse and pufferfish (Fugu rubripes) Stat4 genes revealed a high frequency of Ikaros (Ik) binding elements in all three species. We then investigated the role of Ik binding elements in the human STAT4 promoter using Jurkat T cells. Transactivation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and RNA interference-mediated gene knockdown experiments revealed that Ik is involved in the regulation of STAT4 in human T cells.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is expressed in the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and stimulates pituitary POMC transcription. The role of LIF receptor signaling in HPA axis development was examined. Lifr -/- and Lifr +/+ fetuses were obtained by Cesarean section on E18.5. Despite a 3-fold induction of hypothalamic CRH mRNA, pituitary POMC mRNA and RU486-induced ACTH levels were decreased in Lifr -/- mice. High CRH may be caused by increased central TNFalpha and IL-6 expression. Lifr -/- mice demonstrate elevated pituitary glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptor mRNA and protein levels, indicating the importance of LIF signaling for HPA axis development.

<ABSTRACT>
The very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are synthesized by the microsomal fatty acid elongation system in plants. We investigated cellular function of NbECR putatively encoding enoyl-CoA reductase that catalyzes the last step of VLCFA elongation in Nicotiana benthamiana. Virus-induced gene silencing of NbECR produced necrotic lesions with typical cell death symptoms in leaves. In the affected tissues, ablation of the epidermal cell layer preceded disintegration of the whole leaf cell layers, and disorganized cellular membrane structure was evident. The amount of VLCFAs was reduced in the NbECR VIGS lines, suggesting NbECR function in elongation of VLCFAs. The results demonstrate that NbECR encodes a putative enoyl-CoA reductase and that the NbECR activity is essential for membrane biogenesis in N. benthamiana.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Ceramide kinase (CERK) converts ceramide (Cer) to ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), a newly recognized bioactive molecule capable of regulating diverse cellular functions. The N-terminus of the CERK protein encompasses a sequence motif known as a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. However, little is known regarding the functional roles of this domain in CERK. In this study, we have demonstrated that the PH domain of CERK is essential for its enzyme activity. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have further determined that Leu10 in the PH domain has an important role in CERK activity. Replacing this residue with a neutral alanine or isoleucine, caused a dramatic decrease in CERK activity to 1% and 29%, respectively, compared to CERK, but had no effect on substrate affinity. The study presented here suggests that the PH domain of CERK is not only indispensable for its activity but also act as a regulator of CERK activity.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4297-301.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
As more and more proteins are applied to biochemical research there is increasing interest in studying their stability. In this study, a Markov model has been used to calculate molecular descriptors of the protein structure and these are called the average electrostatic potentials (xi(k)). These descriptors were intended to encode indirect electrostatic pair-wise interactions between amino acids located at Euclidean distance k within a given 3D protein backbone. The different xi(k) values could be calculated for the protein as a whole or for specific protein regions (orbits), which include amino acids that lie within a given range of distances from the center of charge of the protein. In this work we calculated the xi(k) values for 657 mutants of different proteins. A Linear Discriminant Analysis model correctly classified a subset of 435 out of 493 proteins according to their thermal stability - a level of predictability of 88.2%. This experiment was repeated with three additional subsets of proteins selected at random from the initial series of 657. More specifically, the model predicted 314/356 (88.2%) of mutants with higher stability than the corresponding wild-type protein and 264/301 (86.7%) of proteins with near wild-type stability. These results illustrate the possibilities for the average stochastic potentials xi(k) in the study of 3D-structure/property relationships for biochemically relevant proteins.

PHI-1 induced enhancement of myosin phosphorylation in chicken smooth

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4271-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Herein, we provide evidence that in chicken smooth muscle, G-protein stimulation by a Rho-kinase pathway leads to an increase in myosin light chain phosphorylation. Additionally, G-protein stimulation did not increase MYPT1 phosphorylation at Thr695 or Thr850, and CPI-17, was not expressed in chicken smooth muscle. However, PHI-1 was present in chicken smooth muscle tissues. Both agonist and GTP(gamma)S stimulation result in an increase in PHI-1 phosphorylation, which is inhibited by inhibitors to both Rho-kinase (Y-27632) and (PKC) GF109203x. These data suggest that PHI-1 may act as a CPI-17 analog in chicken smooth muscle and inhibit myosin phosphatase activity during G-protein stimulation to produce Ca2+ sensitization.

RNA interference-mediated silencing of the syntaxin 5 gene induces Golgi
fragmentation but capable of transporting vesicles.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4226-34.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
It has been suggested that syntaxin 5 (Syx5) participates in vesicular transport. We examined the effects of Syx5 down-regulation on the morphology of the Golgi apparatus and the transport of vesicles in mammalian cells. Knockdown of the Syx5 gene resulted in Golgi fragmentation without changing the level of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident proteins, other Golgi-SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptors), and coatmer proteins. Strikingly, a major decrease in Syx5 expression barely affected the anterograde transport of vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSVG) protein to the plasma membrane. These results suggest that Syx5 is required for the maintenance of the Golgi structures but may not play a major role in the transport of vesicles carrying VSVG between the ER and the Golgi compartment.

<ABSTRACT>
Circulating HGF is significantly increased in a number of thrombus-associated disorders. Since platelets play a pivotal role in thrombogenesis, the ability of HGF to interact with human platelets was investigated. This paper shows for the first time that human platelets express HGF receptor, the tyrosine kinase encoded by c-MET gene. At physiological concentrations HGF was found to inhibit both glycoprotein (alpha)IIb(beta)3 activation and thrombin-dependent platelet aggregation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These results suggest that circulating HGF may counteract thrombogenesis by negatively modulating platelet functions.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Expression of the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has been demonstrated to be regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and inhibited by intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, P-gp and HIF-1alpha expression were investigated in multicellular prostate tumor spheroids overexpressing the ROS-generating enzyme Nox-1 in comparison to the mother cell line DU-145. In Nox-1-overexpressing tumor spheroids (DU-145Nox1) generation of ROS as well as expression of Nox-1 was significantly increased as compared to DU-145 tumor spheroids. ROS generation was significantly inhibited in the presence of the NADPH-oxidase antagonists diphenylen-iodonium chloride (DPI) and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). Albeit growth kinetic of DU-145Nox1 tumor spheroids was decreased as compared to DU-145 spheroids, elevated expression of Ki-67 was observed indicating increased cell cycle activity. In DU-145Nox1 tumor spheroids, expression of HIF-1alpha as well as P-gp was significantly decreased as compared to DU-145 spheroids, which resulted in an increased retention of the anticancer agent doxorubicin. Pretreatment with the free radical scavengers vitamin E and vitamin C increased the expression of P-gp as well as HIF-1alpha in Nox-1-overexpressing cells, whereas no effect of free radical scavengers was observed on mdr-1 mRNA expression. In summary, the data of the present study demonstrate that the development of P-gp-mediated MDR is abolished under conditions of elevated ROS levels, suggesting that the MDR phenotype can be circumvented by modest increase of intracellular ROS generation.

In vitro selection of DNA binding sites for ABF1 protein from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4535-40.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The autonomously replicating sequence-binding factor 1 (ABF1) from Sacchramoyces cerevisiae is known as a multifunctional DNA binding protein that is involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA-replication, and in restructuring of chromatin via nucleosome remodelling. ABF1 binds to DNA sequences found in ARS elements and in various transcriptional regulatory elements. This led to the early definition of the consensus motive 5'-CGTnnnnnnnGA(G/C)-3'. We have used a SELEX approach to expand and better characterize the DNA sequence requirements of ABF1. Starting from a pool of oligonucleotides randomized at a sequence of 30 nucleotides, we used EMSA to select for sequences with high affinity for ABF1. We obtained the sequences of 106 aptamers after the 15th SELEX round. A 16 nucleotide consensus was derived from this pool by analysis with the motif search programme MEME. Quantitative EMSA experiments verified our experimental approach since binding sequences which were bound with high affinity occurred more often in the pool and resembled the derived consensus to a higher degree. We found DNA sequences that are bound by ABF1 with nearly two-magnitude higher affinity as compared to the hitherto accepted ABF1 consensus sequence. This led us to postulate a strong recognition motive: 5'-TnnCGTnnnnnnTGAT-3'.

Gelatin binding to the 8F19F1 module pair of human fibronectin requires
site-specific N-glycosylation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4529-34.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The gelatin (denatured collagen) binding domain of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin contains three potential N-glycosylation sites. Complete deglycosylation of this domain is known to reduce the thermal stability of the eighth type 1 (8F1) module. We have conducted a site-specific analysis of the structural and functional consequences of N-linked glycosylation in the 8F19F1 module pair. Three glycoforms have been identified by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Chemical shift differences between the glycoforms have revealed an intimate interaction between one N-linked sugar and the polypeptide that is critical for gelatin binding, as shown by affinity chromatography.

A unified framework for unraveling the functional interaction structure of
a biomolecular network based on stimulus-response experimental data.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4520-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We propose a unified framework for the identification of functional interaction structures of biomolecular networks in a way that leads to a new experimental design procedure. In developing our approach, we have built upon previous work. Thus we begin by pointing out some of the restrictions associated with existing structure identification methods and point out how these restrictions may be eased. In particular, existing methods use specific forms of experimental algebraic equations with which to identify the functional interaction structure of a biomolecular network. In our work, we employ an extended form of these experimental algebraic equations which, while retaining their merits, also overcome some of their disadvantages. Experimental data are required in order to estimate the coefficients of the experimental algebraic equation set associated with the structure identification task. However, experimentalists are rarely provided with guidance on which parameters to perturb, and to what extent, to perturb them. When a model of network dynamics is required then there is also the vexed question of sample rate and sample time selection to be resolved. Supplying some answers to these questions is the main motivation of this paper. The approach is based on stationary and/or temporal data obtained from parameter perturbations, and unifies the previous approaches of Kholodenko et al. (PNAS 99 (2002) 12841-12846) and Sontag et al. (Bioinformatics 20 (2004) 1877-1886). By way of demonstration, we apply our unified approach to a network model which cannot be properly identified by existing methods. Finally, we propose an experiment design methodology, which is not limited by the amount of parameter perturbations, and illustrate its use with an in numero example.

Tendon xanthomas in familial hypercholesterolemia are associated with a
differential inflammatory response of macrophages to oxidized LDL.

<ABSTRACT>
Tendon xanthomas (TX) are pathognomonic lipid deposits commonly found in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether macrophages from FH patients with TX (TX+) have higher predisposition to foam cells formation after oxidized LDL (oxLDL) overload than those from FH patients without TX (TX-), and if their differential gene expression profile could explain these different phenotypes. Total RNA pools from macrophages from FH patients TX+ and TX- were analyzed using Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays to evaluate the gene expression profile in presence and absence of oxLDL. Also, the intracellular lipid content was measured by fluorescence flow cytometry. Results of these studies suggest that macrophages from FH subjects TX+ compared to those TX- have a differential response to oxLDL, since they show higher intracellular cholesterol ester accumulation and a differential gene expression profile. The gene array data were validated by relative quantitative real-time RT-PCR and quantitative ELISA in culture media and plasma samples. FH subjects TX+ showed increased plasma tryptase, TNF-alpha, IL-8 and IL-6 concentrations. We propose that TX formation are associated with higher intracellular lipid content, and higher inflammatory response of macrophages in response to oxLDL.

Re-evaluating the role of strongly charged sequences in amphipathic
cell-penetrating peptides:    a fluorescence study using Pep-1.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4498-502.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are able to translocate across biological membranes and deliver bioactive proteins. Cellular uptake and intracellular distribution of CPPs is commonly evaluated with fluorescent labels, which can alter peptide properties. The effect of carboxyfluorescein label in the Lys-rich domain of the amphipathic CPP pep-1, was evaluated and compared with non-labelled pep-1 in vitro and in vivo. A reduced membrane affinity and an endosomal-dependent translocation mechanism, at variance with non-labelled pep-1, were detected. Therefore, the charged domain is not a mere enabler of peptide adsorption but has a crucial role in the translocation pathway of non-labelled pep-1.

Crystal structure of a mutant elongation factor G trapped with a GTP

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4492-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Elongation factor G (EF-G) is a G protein factor that catalyzes the translocation step in protein synthesis on the ribosome. Its GTP conformation in the absence of the ribosome is currently unknown. We present the structure of a mutant EF-G (T84A) in complex with the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GDPNP. The crystal structure provides a first insight into conformational changes induced in EF-G by GTP. Comparison of this structure with that of EF-G in complex with GDP suggests that the GTP and GDP conformations in solution are very similar and that the major contribution to the active GTPase conformation, which is quite different, therefore comes from its interaction with the ribosome.

The use of abscisic acid analogues to analyse the substrate selectivity of

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4454-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
This study analyses the activity of an Arabidopsis thaliana UDP-glycosyltransferase, UGT71B6 (71B6), towards abscisic acid (ABA) and its structural analogues. The enzyme preferentially glucosylated ABA and not its catabolites. The requirement for a specific chiral configuration of (+)-ABA was demonstrated through the use of analogues with the chiral centre changed or removed. The enzyme was able to accommodate extra bulk around the double bond of the ABA ring but not alterations to the 8'- and 9'-methyl groups. Interestingly, the ketone of ABA was not required for glucosylation. Bioactive analogues, resistant to 8'-hydroxylation, were also poor substrates for conjugation by UGT71B6. This suggests the compounds may be resistant to both pathways of ABA inactivation and may, therefore, prove to be useful agrochemicals for field applications.

Sodium channel activators: model of binding inside the pore and a possible
mechanism of action.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 15;579(20):4207-12.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Sodium channel activators, batrachotoxin and veratridine, cause sodium channels to activate easier and stay open longer than normal channels. Traditionally, this was explained by an allosteric mechanism. However, increasing evidence suggests that activators can bind inside the pore. Here, we model the open sodium channel with activators and propose a novel mechanism of their action. The activator-bound channel retains a hydrophilic pathway for ions between the ligand and conserved asparagine in segment S6 of repeat II. One end of the activator approaches the selectivity filter, decreasing the channel conductance and selectivity. The opposite end reaches the gate stabilizing it in the open state.

Defective binding of transcriptional repressor ZEB via DNA methylation

cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Little is known about the molecular mediators of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway involved in the machinery that maintains genomic integrity. Here, we report that the levels of p73 and its target genes, are increased in cells derived from FA patients belonging to complementation group A (FA-A). Moreover, functional correction of FA-A cells by gene transfer reduces the expression of p73. We also demonstrate that DNA methylation contributes to increased levels of p73 in FA-A cells by hampering the binding of the transcriptional repressor ZEB to an intronic regulatory region of the p73 gene. Together, our data may help explain the susceptibility of these cells to DNA damaging agents.

<ABSTRACT>
A population of 9471 stable activation-tagged lines was generated by transposable element mediated activation tagging mutagenesis in Arabidopsis (TAMARA) using the maize En/Spm transposon system. Based on DNA gel blot and flanking sequence analysis, this population contains approximately 6000 independent transposon insertions. A greenhouse-based screen identified six dominant or semi-dominant activation tagged mutants with obvious developmental alterations, among these a new pistillata mutant allele. In addition, a subset of 1500 lines was screened by a HPLC based high-throughput method for dominant activation tagged mutants with enhanced contents of phenolic compounds. One dominant activation tagged mutant (hpc1-1D) was isolated showing accumulation of a particular compound due to the upregulation of an R2R3-MYB transcription factor.

<ABSTRACT>
The effect of loss of the 34-kDa periplasmic NosX protein on the properties of N2O reductase was investigated with an N2O-respiration negative, double mutant of the paralogous genes nosX and nirX of Paracoccus denitrificans. In spite of absence of whole-cell N2O-reducing activity, the purified reductase was catalytically active, which attributes NosX a physiological role in sustaining the reaction cycle. N2O reductase exhibited the spectroscopic features of Cu(A) and the redox-inert, paramagnetic state, Cu(Z)*, of the catalytic center. Cu(Z)*, hitherto considered the result of spontaneous reaction of the reductase with dioxygen, attains cellular significance.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4567-70.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cytochrome bd is one of the two terminal ubiquinol oxidases in the respiratory chain of Escherichia coli catalyzing reduction of O2 to H2O. The enzyme is expressed under low oxygen tension; due to high affinity for O2 it is isolated mainly as a stable oxygenated complex. Direct measurement of O2 binding to heme d in the one-electron reduced isolated enzyme gives K(d(O2)) of approximately 280 nM. It is possible to photolyse the heme d oxy-complex by illumination of the enzyme for several minutes under microaerobic conditions; the light-induced difference absorption spectrum is virtually identical to the inverted spectrum of O2 binding to heme d.

<ABSTRACT>
The relation between the position of mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic network and their lethality is the subject of this work. We represent the topology of the network by a directed graph: nodes are metabolites and arcs represent the reactions; a mutation corresponds to the removal of all the arcs referring to the deleted enzyme. Using publicly available knock-out data, we show that lethality corresponds to the lack of alternative paths in the perturbed network linking the nodes affected by the enzyme deletion. Such feature is at the basis of the recently recognized importance of 'marginal' arcs of metabolic networks.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major complication of chronic viral hepatitis C. Therapy for HCC is still disappointing. It is thus of great importance to identify novel HCC markers for early detection of the disease, and tumor-specific proteins as potential therapeutic targets. We have used a proteomic approach to identify new proteins involved in HCC development. Four cases of HCC developing from chronic viral hepatitis C were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), and results were compared to those of paired adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues. For MS fingerprinting, protein spots with differential intensity between HCC and non-tumorous liver were directly cut out of gels and processed for MALDI-MS and nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Approximately 850 spots were visualized in each gel. The comparative analysis of paired samples indicated that 345 protein spots showed significant differences in expression level between non-tumor and tumor tissue. Among the 345 protein spots analyzed, 238 spots corresponding to 155 different proteins were identified; 49 proteins were up-regulated, whereas 106 proteins were down-regulated. Among these 155 proteins, 91 proteins were regulated in at least three cases. Although 52 out of these 91 proteins have been already described by previous proteomic or transcriptomic studies, or are already known to be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, this experiment revealed 39 new proteins differentially expressed in HCC developing from viral hepatitis C. Variations in protein accumulation were confirmed for two selected proteins (apolipoprotein E, chloride intracellular channel 1) by Western blotting in ten additional cases of HCC developing in patients with viral hepatitis C.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteome analysis of embryo and endosperm tissues from germinating tomato seed was conducted using 1-DE, 2-DE, and MS. Mobilization of the most abundant proteins, which showed similar profiles in the two tissues, occurred first in the endosperm. CBB R-250 staining of 2-DE gels revealed 352 and 369 major protein spots in the embryo and endosperm, respectively, at 0 h. Of these, 75 major spots were selected, excised, in-gel digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS and/or LC-ESI-Q/TOF-MS/MS. Peptide MS and MS/MS data were searched against publicly available protein and EST databases, and 47 proteins identified. Embryo-specific proteins included a BAC19.13 homologue, whereas four proteins specific to the endosperm were tomato mosaic virus coat proteins related to defense mechanisms. The most abundant proteins both in the embryo and endosperm were seed storage proteins, i.e., legumins (11 spots), vicilins (11 spots), albumin (2 spots). Housekeeping enzymes, actin-binding profilin, defense-related protein kinases, nonspecific lipid transfer protein, and proteins involved in general metabolism were also identified. The roles of some of the proteins identified in the embryo and endosperm are discussed in relation to seed germination in tomato.

Subproteomic analysis of metal-interacting proteins in human B cells.

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3614-22.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Metal-protein interactions are vitally important in all living organisms. Metalloproteins, including structural proteins and metabolic enzymes, participate in energy transfer and redox reactions or act as metallochaperones in metal trafficking. Among metal-associated diseases, T cell mediated allergy to nickel (Ni) represents the most common form of human contact hypersensitivity. With the aim to elucidate disease-underlying mechanisms such as Ni-specific T cell activation, we initiated a proteomic approach to identify Ni-interacting proteins in human B cells. As antigen presenting cells, B cells are capable of presenting MHC-associated Ni-epitopes to T cells, a prerequisite for hapten-specific T cell activation. Using metal-affinity enrichment, 2-DE and MS, 22 Ni-interacting proteins were identified. In addition to known Ni-binding molecules such as tubulin, actin or cullin-2, we unexpectedly discovered that at least nine of these 22 proteins belong to stress-inducible heat shock proteins or chaperonins. Enrichment was particularly effective for the hetero-oligomeric TRiC/CCT complex, which is involved in MHC class I processing. Blue Native/SDS electrophoresis analysis revealed that Ni-NTA-beads specifically retained the complete protein machinery, including the associated chaperonin substrate tubulin. The apparent Ni-affinity of heat shock proteins suggests a new function of these molecules in human Ni allergy, by linking innate and adaptive immune responses.

Peptide microarrays for the characterization of antigenic regions of human
chromogranin A.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3600-3.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Microarraying peptides is a powerful proteomics technique for studying molecular recognition events. Since peptides have small molecular mass, they are not easily accessible when adsorbed onto solid supports. Moreover, peptides can lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure, and therefore a correct orientation is essential to promote the interaction with their target. In this work, we investigated the suitability as a peptide array substrate of a glass slide coated with a copolymer of N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N,N-acryloyloxysuccinimide, and [3-(methacryloyl-oxy)propyl]trimethoxysilyl. This polymeric surface was used as substrate for peptides in the characterization of linear antigenic sites of human chromogranin A, a useful tissue and serum marker for neuroendocrine tumors and a precursor of many biologically active peptides. The microarray support provided sufficient accessibility of the ligand, with no need for a spacer, as the polymer chains prevent interaction of immobilized peptides with substrate. In addition, the polymeric surface constitutes an aqueous micro-environment in which linear epitopes are freely exposed despite peptide random orientation. The results reported in this article are in accordance with those obtained in conventional ELISA assays using biotinylated and non-biotinylated peptides.

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3589-99.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We present a phosphoproteomics approach using diagonal RP chromatography as the basic isolation principle. Phosphopeptides present in a tryptic digest of total cellular lysates were first enriched by Fe3+-immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Further sorting of the phosphopeptides took place in three steps. First, the resulting peptide mixture was fractionated over reversed-phase chromatography. Second, peptides present in each fraction were treated with phosphatases. Third, the dephosphorylated peptides were then more hydrophobic and shifted towards a later elution interval from the contaminating non-phosphopeptides eluting at the same position as during the primary run. Since the phosphopeptides are isolated as their dephosphorylated form, additional proof for their original phosphorylation state was obtained by split-differential 16O-18O labeling. The method was validated with alpha-casein phosphopeptides and consecutively applied on HepG2 cells. We identified 190 phosphorylated peptides from 152 different proteins. This dataset includes 38 novel protein phosphorylation sites.

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3712-21.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known for the chronic lung colonization of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in addition to eye, ear and urinary tract infections. With the underlying disease CF patients are predisposed to P. aeruginosa chronic lung infection, which leads to morbidity and mortality. In this study, we compared the protein expression profile of a CF lung-adapted P. aeruginosa strain C with that of the burn-wound isolate PAO. Differentially expressed proteins from the whole-cell, membrane, periplasmic as well as extracellular fraction were identified. The whole-cell proteome of strain C showed down-regulation of several proteins involved in amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, energy metabolism and adaptation leading to a highly distinct proteome pattern for strain C in comparison to PAO. Analysis of secreted proteins by strain C compared to PAO revealed differential expression of virulence factors under non-inducing conditions. The membrane proteome of strain C showed modulation of the expression of porins involved in nutrient and antibiotic influx. The proteome of the periplasmic space of strain C showed retention of elastase despite that the equal amounts were secreted by strain C and PAO. Altogether, our results elucidate adaptive strategies of P. aeruginosa towards the nutrient-rich CF lung habitat during the course of chronic colonization.

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3637-45.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Identification of plasma membrane markers of basal keratinocytes is essential for sorting basal cells and, subsequently, adult epidermal stem cells. In this study, we isolated caveolin-1-enriched microdomains from human HaCaT keratinocytes and identified proteins representing potential cell surface markers of the epidermis by a proteomic approach. The purification of this caveolae domain allowed us to characterize 53 proteins of which 26% were transmembrane and 32% associated-membrane proteins. One of them, CD98, was found to be co-localized with beta1 integrin at the plasma membrane of the basal keratinocytes of healthy human epidermis. We then isolated CD98-positive keratinocytes from fresh skin biopsies. Using clonogenic assays, we demonstrate that CD98 may be considered as a marker of transient amplifying human keratinocytes.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Recent evidence indicates that cell-cycle regulating proteins are involved in apoptotic process in post-mitotic neurons. In this study, we examined cell-cycle regulators for G1/S cell-cycle progression after a transient focal cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. In the cerebral frontoparietal cortex, we observed a marked induction of Cyclin D1 (a coactivator of Cdks), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), together with upregulated Cdk kinase activities. This process is accompanied with multiple phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein at Cdk phosphorylation sites in neurons from the ischemic cortex. We further examined DNA synthesis by the incorporation of BrdU, a nucleotide analog that incorporates into newly synthesized DNA. Within 24-h of reperfusion after 60-min occlusion, substantial BrdU-positive neurons were observed in the ischemic cortex. Inhibition of Cdk4 activity during this ischemia/reperfusion is highly neuroprotective. These results suggest that ischemia/reperfusion cerebral damage induces signalings at the G1/S cell-cycle transition, and may constitute a critical step in the neuronal apoptotic pathway in ischemia/reperfusion induced neuronal damage.

Impairment of the activity of the xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes
arylamine N-acetyltransferases 1 and 2 (NAT1/NAT2) by peroxynitrite in
mouse skeletal muscle cells.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4719-23.

<ABSTRACT>
Reactive nitrogen species and their by-products, such as peroxynitrite, modulate many physiological functions of skeletal muscle. Peroxynitrite generation occuring under specific conditions, such as inflammation, may also lead to skeletal muscle dysfunction and pathologies. Arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NATs) are xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) involved in the detoxification and/or metabolic activation of several drugs and chemicals. In addition to other XMEs, such as gluthatione S-transferases or cytochromes P450, NAT enzymes are expressed in skeletal muscle. We show here that functional NAT1 and NAT2 isoforms are expressed in mouse myotubes and that peroxynitrite may impair their activity in these cells. We show that this inactivation is likely due to the irreversible modification of NATs catalytic cysteine residue in vivo. Our results suggest that peroxynitrite-dependent inactivation of muscle XMEs such as NATs may contribute to muscle dysfunction by impairing the biotransformation activity of this key cellular defense enzyme system.

Conformation-driven and semiquinone-gated proton-pump mechanism in the
NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I).
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4555-61.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A novel mechanism for proton/electron transfer is proposed for NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (complex I) based on the following findings: (1) EPR signals of the protein-bound fast-relaxing semiquinone anion radicals (abbreviated as Q(Nf)-) are observable only in the presence of proton-transmembrane electrochemical potential; (2) Iron-sulfur cluster N2 and Q(Nf)- are directly spin-coupled; and (3) The projection of the interspin vector extends only 5A along the membrane normal [Yano, T., Dunham, W.R. and Ohnishi, T. (2005) Biochemistry, 44, 1744-1754]. We propose that the proton pump is operated by redox-driven conformational changes of the quinone binding protein. In the input state, semiquinone is reduced to quinol, acquiring two protons from the N (matrix) side of the mitochondrial inner membrane and an electron from the low potential (NADH) side of the respiratory chain. A conformational change brings the protons into position for release at the P (inter-membrane space) side of the membrane via a proton-well. Concomitantly, an electron is donated to the quinone pool at the high potential side of the coupling site. The system then returns to the original state to repeat the cycle. This hypothesis provides a useful frame work for further investigation of the mechanism of proton translocation in complex I.

Suppression of hypothalamic deiodinase type II activity blunts TRH mRNA
decline during fasting.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4654-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Fasting is characterized by disrupted thyroid feedback, with suppressed levels of thyroid hormones and paraventricular thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH). We found that third ventricle administration of the deiodinase inhibitor, iopanoic acid, dose-dependently reduced deiodinase type II (DII) activity selectively in the hypothalamus. This suppression of DII by iopanoic acid during fasting prevented elevated DII activity and blunted the decline in hypothalamic TRH mRNA levels. Because fasting-induced elevation in hypothalamic DII activity is paralleled by increased hypothalamic T3 concentration, our study suggests that T3 formation by DII in the hypothalamus is the cause of disrupted thyroid feedback during fasting.

GABA, progesterone and zona pellucida activation of PLA2 and regulation by
MEK-ERK1/2 during acrosomal exocytosis in guinea pig spermatozoa.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4692-700.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We investigated whether GABA activates phospholipase A2 (PLA2) during acrosomal exocytosis, and if the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway modulates PLA2 activation initiated by GABA, progesterone or zona pellucida (ZP). In guinea pig spermatozoa prelabelled with [14C]arachidonic acid or [14C]choline chloride, GABA stimulated a decrease in phosphatidylcholine (PC), and release of arachidonic acid and lysoPC, during exocytosis. These lipid changes are indicative of PLA2 activation and appear essential for exocytosis since inclusion of aristolochic acid (a PLA2 inhibitor) abrogated them, along with exocytosis. GABA activation of PLA2 seems to be mediated, at least in part, by diacylglycerol (DAG) and protein kinase C since inclusion of the DAG kinase inhibitor R59022 enhanced PLA2 activity and exocytosis stimulated by GABA, whereas exposure to staurosporine decreased both. GABA-, progesterone- and ZP-induced release of arachidonic acid and exocytosis were prevented by U0126 and PD98059 (MEK inhibitors). Taken together, our results suggest that PLA2 plays a fundamental role in agonist-stimulated exocytosis and that MEK-ERK1/2 are involved in PLA2 regulation during this process.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4600-4.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The X-ray structure of the gamma-subunit of the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrC) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus was determined at 1.12 and 2.1A resolution, in the two crystal forms named DsrC(nat) and DsrC(ox) the latter being cocrystallized with the oxidizing agent tert-butyl hydroperoxide. The fold corresponds to that of the homologous protein from Pyrobaculum aerophilum but is significantly more compact. The most interesting, highly conserved C-terminal arm adopts a well-defined conformation in A. fulgidus DsrC in contrast to the completely disordered conformation in P. aerophilum DsrC. The functional relevance of both conformations and of a potentially redox-active disulfide bond between the strictly invariant Cys103 and Cys114 are discussed.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4701-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Structural properties of a bacterial luciferase mutant, evolved by random mutagenesis, have been investigated. Bacterial luciferases (LuxAB) can be readily classed as slow or fast decay luciferases based on their rates of luminescence decay in a single turnover assay. By random mutagenesis, one of the mutants generated by a single mutation on LuxA at position 175 (E175G) resulted in the "slow decay" Xenorhabdus luminescens luciferase was converted into a luciferase with a significantly more rapid decay rate [Hosseinkhani, S., Szittner, R. and Meighen, E.A. (2005) Biochemical Journal 385, 575-580]. A single mutation (E175G), in a loop that connects alpha helix 5 and beta sheet 5 brought about changes in the kinetic and structural properties of the enzyme. Enhancement of tryptophan fluorescence was observed with a lower degree of fluorescence quenching by acrylamide upon mutation. Near- and far-UV circular dichroism spectra of the native and mutant forms suggested formation of an intermediate structure, further supported by 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulphonic acid (ANS) fluorescence which indicated lower exposure of hydrophobic residues as a result of mutation. Fluorescence quenching studies utilizing acrylamide indicated a more accessible fluor for the native form. Thus, the E175G point mutation appears to change the enzymatic decay rate by inducing a substantial tertiary structural change, without a large effect on secondary structural elements, as revealed by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy. Overall, the mutation caused structural changes that go beyond the simple change in orientation of Glu175.

Mammalian NHE2 Na(+)/H+ exchanger mediates efflux of potassium upon
heterologous expression in yeast.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4733-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Na(+)/H+exchangers form a broad family of transporters that mediate opposing fluxes of alkali metal cations and protons across cell membranes. They play multiple roles in different organisms (protection from toxic cations, regulation of cell volume or pH). Rat NHE2 exchanger was expressed in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strain lacking its own exporters of alkali metal cations. Though most of the overexpressed NHE2 remained entrapped in the secretory pathway, part of it reached the plasma membrane and mediated K+ efflux from the yeast. We demonstrate for the first time that a mammalian Na(+)/H+ exchanger transports alkali metal cations in yeast in the opposite direction than in mammalian cells, and that the substrate specificity of the rat NHE2 exchanger is limited only to potassium cations upon expression in yeast cells.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The maturation of Borna disease virus (BDV) glycoprotein GP was studied in regard to intracellular compartmentalization, compartmentalization signal-domains, proteolytic processing, and packaging into virus particles. Our data show that BDV-GP is (i) predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), (ii) partially exists in the ER already as cleaved subunits GP-N and GP-C, (iii) is directed to the ER/cis-Golgi region by its transmembrane and/or cytoplasmic domains in CD8-BDV-GP hybrid constructs and (iv) is incorporated in the virus particles as authentic BDV glycoprotein exclusively in the cleaved form decorated with N-glycans of the complex type. Downregulation of BDV-glycoproteins on the cell surface, their limited proteolytic processing, and protection of antigenic epitopes on the viral glycoproteins by host-identical N-glycans are different strategies for persistent virus infections.

<ABSTRACT>
A novel chemical ontology based on chemical functional groups automatically, objectively assigned by a computer program, was developed to categorize small molecules. It has been applied to PubChem and the small molecule interaction database to demonstrate its utility as a basic pharmacophore search system. Molecules can be compared using a semantic similarity score based on functional group assignments rather than 3D shape, which succeeds in identifying small molecules known to bind a common binding site. This ontology will serve as a powerful tool for searching chemical databases and identifying key functional groups responsible for biological activities.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The active center of the glycoside hydrolase family 32 contains the three characteristic motifs (N/S)DPNG, RDP, and EC. We replaced the N-terminal region including the (N/S)DPNG motif of barley 6-SFT (sucrose:fructan 6-fructosyltransferase) by the corresponding region of Festuca 1-SST (sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase). The chimeric enzyme, expressed in Pichia, retained the specificity of 6-SFT. Attempts to replace a larger piece at the N-terminus including also the RDP motif failed. A point mutation introduced in the RDP motif of 1-SST abolished enzymatic activity. Interestingly, point mutations of the EC-motif resulted in an enzyme which had lost the capability to form 1-kestose and glucose from sucrose but still accepted 1-kestose, producing fructose and sucrose as well as nystose.

<ABSTRACT>
It was demonstrated previously that in erythroid chicken cells an extended upstream area of the alpha-globin gene domain is transcribed in both directions as a part of ggPRX gene and a part of a full domain transcript of the alpha-globin gene domain. Here, we show that both DNA chains of the above-mentioned region are transcribed in the same cells and that the corresponding transcripts coexist in nuclei. The data obtained suggest that cells possess a molecular mechanism which in some cases prevents the formation of dsRNA and subsequent destruction of both transcripts in spite of the presence of complementary RNA chains in the cell nucleus.

The Drosophila type II receptor, Wishful thinking, binds BMP and

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4615-21.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Wishful thinking (Wit) is a Drosophila transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) superfamily type II receptor most related to the mammalian bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type II receptor, BMPRII. To better understand its function, we undertook a biochemical approach to establish the ligand binding repertoire and downstream signaling pathway. We observed that BMP4 and BMP7, bound to receptor complexes comprised of Wit and the type I receptor thickveins and saxophone to activate a BMP-like signaling pathway. Further we demonstrated that both myoglianin and its most closely related mammalian ligand, myostatin, interacted with a Wit and Baboon (Babo) type II-type I receptor complex to activate TGFbeta/activin-like signaling pathways. These results thereby demonstrate that Wit binds multiple ligands to activate both BMP and TGFbeta-like signaling pathways. Given that myoglianin is expressed in muscle and glial-derived cells, these results also suggest that Wit may mediate myoglianin-dependent signals in the nervous system.

<ABSTRACT>
Inactivation of the chlN gene in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 resulted in no chlorophyll and photosystems when the mutant was grown in darkness, providing an in vivo system to study the structure and function of phycobilisomes (PBSs). The effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and metal ions on the mutant PBSs in vivo were investigated by low temperature fluorescence emission measurement. H2O2 induced an obvious disassembly of the cores of PBSs and interruption of energy transfer from allophycocyanin to the terminal emitter. Among many metal ions only silver induced disassembly of the cores of PBSs. Our results demonstrated for the first time that the cores of PBSs act as targets in vivo for oxidative stress or silver induced damage.

<ABSTRACT>
Overexpression of the yeaS gene encoding a protein belonging to the RhtB transporter family conferred upon cells resistance to glycyl-l-leucine, leucine analogues, several amino acids and their analogues. yeaS overexpression promoted leucine and, to a lesser extent, methionine and histidine accumulation by the respective producing strains. Our results indicate that yeaS encodes an exporter of leucine and some other structurally unrelated amino acids. The expression of yeaS (renamed leuE for "leucine export") was induced by leucine, l-alpha-amino-n-butyric acid and, to a lesser extent, by several other amino acids. The global regulator Lrp mediated this induction.

Mechanism of direct degradation of IkappaBalpha by 20S proteasome.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4797-802.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
IkappaBalpha regulates activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. NF-kappaB is activated in response to several stimuli, i.e. proinflamatory cytokines, infections, and physical stress. This signal dependent pathway involves IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and degradation by 26S proteasome. A signal independent (basal) turnover of IkappaBalpha has also been described. Here, we show that IkappaBalpha can be directly degraded by 20S proteasomes. Deletion constructs of IkappaBalpha allow us to the determine that N-terminal (DeltaN 1-70) and C-terminal regions (DeltaC 280-327, removing the PEST region) of IkappaBalpha are not required for IkappaBalpha degradation, while a further C-terminal deletion including part of the arm repeats (DeltaC2 245-327) almost completely suppress the degradation by 20S proteasome. Binding and competition experiments demonstrate that the degradation of IkappaBalpha involves specific interactions with alpha2(C3) subunit of the proteasome. Finally, p65/relA (not itself a substrate for 20S proteasome) inhibits the degradation of IkappaBalpha by the proteasome. These results recapitulate in vitro the main characteristics of signal independent (basal) turnover of IkappaBalpha demonstrated in intact cells.

Oxidized phospholipids induce phase separation in lipid vesicles.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4577-84.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The thermal behaviour of phospholipid multilamellar vesicles (MLV) made of various molar percentages of DPPC and LPPC, containing also oxidized LPPC (LPPCox), was studied by use of EPR spectroscopy and n-DSPC spin label in order to determine variations in the membrane fluidity brought about by lipid oxidation. Experimental variables were temperature, ranging from 4 to 44 degrees C, and molar percentage composition of DPPC/LPPC/LPPCox ternary mixture. We found that the presence of LPPCox in a percentage higher than both normal phospholipids' heavily hindered membrane formation, while lower percentage of the oxidized lipid with higher DPPC percentages yielded two-components EPR spectra, showing the presence of two different fluidity domains, indicative of membrane phase separation. When LPPC was the dominant lipid in the ternary mixture, simple EPR spectra were observed, indicating homogeneity of MLV membranes. Phase separation observed in the presence of LPPCox was better visible at lower temperature (12 degrees C or less), and almost disappeared with increasing temperature (36 degrees C or more). Furthermore, the correlation time of 16-DSPC in ternary mixture MLVs with higher LPPC percentage (homogeneous membranes) was not affected by the presence of LPPCox, while it normally increased upon DPPC percentage increase, as readily calculated from the EPR spectra featuring simple bands at 24 degrees C. It is concluded that oxidized lipid induces phase separation in more rigid DPPC-rich membranes, while leaving fluidity unaffected in more fluid LPPC-rich membranes, and at higher temperature.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia) patients manifest a pro-atherogenic lipid profile but are not at elevated risk for developing atherosclerosis. Serum phospholipid, which correlates positively with the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI)-mediated cholesterol efflux, and apolipoprotein A-IV and E, acceptors for ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-mediated cholesterol transport, are increased in GSD-Ia mice. Importantly, sera from GSD-Ia mice are more efficient than sera from control littermates in promoting SR-BI- and ABCA1-mediated cholesterol effluxes. As the first step in reverse cholesterol transport, essential for cholesterol homeostasis, these observations provide one explanation why GSD-Ia patients are apparently protected against premature atherosclerosis.

<ABSTRACT>
We report a time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy characterization of photosystem I (PSI) particles prepared from Arabidopsis lines with knock-out mutations against the peripheral antenna proteins of Lhca1 or Lhca4. The first mutant retains Lhca2 and Lhca3 while the second retains one other light-harvesting protein of photosystem I (Lhca) protein, probably Lhca5. The results indicate that Lhca2/3 and Lhca1/4 each provides about equally effective energy transfer routes to the PSI core complex, and that Lhca5 provides a less effective energy transfer route. We suggest that the specific location of each Lhca protein within the PSI-LHCI supercomplex is more important than the presence of so-called red chlorophylls in the Lhca proteins.

Ectoine and hydroxyectoine inhibit aggregation and neurotoxicity of
Alzheimer's beta-amyloid.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4775-80.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
beta-Amyloid peptide (Abeta) is the major constituent of senile plaques, the key pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta is physiologically produced as a soluble form, but aggregation of Abeta monomers into oligomers/fibrils causes neurotoxic change of the peptide. In nature, many microorganisms accumulate small molecule chaperones (SMCs) under stressful conditions to prevent the misfolding/denaturation of proteins and to maintain their stability. Hence, it is conceivable that SMCs such as ectoine and hydroxyectoine could be potential inhibitors against the aggregate formation of Alzheimer's Abeta, which has not been studied to date. The current work shows the effectiveness of ectoine and hydroxyectoine on the inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation and toxicity to human neuroblastoma cells. The characterization tools used for this study include thioflavin-T induced fluorescence, atomic force microscopy and cell viability assay. Considering that ectoine and hydroxyectoine are not toxic to cellular environment even at concentrations as high as 100 mM, the results may suggest a basis for the development of ectoines as potential inhibitors associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Dysfunction of the microtubule system is emerging as a contributing factor in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Looking for the potential role played by the microtubule cytoskeleton in neuron degeneration underlying Parkinson's disease (PD), we investigate the influence of the parkinsonism producing neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) on microtubule dynamics. We find that it acts as a strong catastrophe promoter causing a decrease of the average length of microtubules assembled from purified tubulin. We also find that it reduces the number of microtubules nucleated from purified centrosomes. Finally, binding assays demonstrate that the neurotoxin binds specifically to tubulin in the microtubule lattice in a close to stoichiometric manner. This paper provides the first evidence that dynamic instability of microtubules is specifically affected by MPP+ and suggests that it could play a role in neuronal cell death underlying PD.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Dextransucrase S (DSRS) is the only active glucansucrase that has been found in Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512F strain. Native DSRS produces mainly 6-linked glucopyranosyl residue (Glcp), while Escherichia coli recombinant DSRS was observed to produce a glucan consisting of 70% 6-linked Glcp and 15% 3,6-Glcp. Lys residues were introduced at the N-terminal end of the core domain by site-directed mutagenesis. In glucans produced by the one-point mutants T350K and S455K, the amount of 6-linked Glcp was increased to about 85% of the total glucan produced, more similar in structure to native B-512F dextran. The double mutant T350K/S455K produced adhesive, water-insoluble glucan with 77% 6-linked Glcp, 8% 3,6-linked Glcp and 4% 2,6-linked Glcp. The T350K/S455K mutant exhibited a 10-fold increase in glucosyltransferase activity over those of the parental DSRS-His(6) and its T350K and S455K mutants. This is the first report demonstrating a change in the properties of a dextransucrase or a related glucosyltransferase through simple site-directed mutagenesis to create 2,6-linked Glcp.

<ABSTRACT>
PML5 is a functional derivative of a family I.3 lipase from Pseudomonas sp. MIS38 and contains five repeats of a nine-residue sequence motif. Two aspartate residues within the second and third repetitive sequences of PML5 were replaced by Ala. The secretion level, intracellular accumulation level, and stability of the resultant mutant protein were greatly reduced as compared to those of PML5. In addition, this mutant protein was inactive and did not bind Ca2+ ion. We propose that the repetitive sequences of PML5 form a beta-roll structure in the cells and thereby contribute to the intracellular stability and secretion efficiency of the protein.

Purine catabolic pathway in Bacillus subtilis is consisted of more than 14 genes. Among these genes, pucL and pucM are required for uricase activity.

Here, we provide evidence that PucM, a transthyretin-related protein, functions to facilitate the hydrolysis of 5-hydroxyisourate, the end product of the uricase reaction. Based on these results, we propose that transthyretin-related proteins present in diverse organisms are not functionally related to transthyretin but actually function as a hydroxyisourate hydrolase.

Deletion of flavoredoxin gene in Desulfovibrio gigas reveals its
participation in thiosulfate reduction.

<ABSTRACT>
The gene encoding Desulfovibrio gigas flavoredoxin was deleted to elucidate its physiological role in the sulfate metabolism. Disruption of flr gene strongly inhibited the reduction of thiosulfate and exhibited a reduced growth in the presence of sulfite with lactate as electron donor. The growth with sulfate was not however affected by the lack of this protein. Additionally, flr mutant cells revealed a decrease of about 50% in the H2 consumption rate using thiosulfate as electron acceptor. Altogether, our results show in vivo that during sulfite respiration, trithionate and thiosulfate are produced and that flavoredoxin is specific for thiosulfate reduction.

Effects of N-acylethanolamines on the respiratory chain and production of
reactive oxygen species in heart mitochondria.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4724-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Long-chain N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) have been found to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation and to inhibit uncoupled respiration of rat heart mitochondria [Wasilewski, M., Wieckowski, M.R., Dymkowska, D. and Wojtczak, L. (2004) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1657, 151-163]. The aim of the present work was to investigate in more detail the mechanism of the inhibitory effects of NAEs on the respiratory chain. In connection with this, we also investigated a possible action of NAEs on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by respiring rat heart mitochondria. It was found that unsaturated NAEs, N-oleoylethanolamine (N-Ole) and, to a greater extent, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (N-Ara), inhibited predominantly complex I of the respiratory chain, with a much weaker effect on complexes II and III, and no effect on complex IV. Saturated N-palmitoylethanolamine had a much smaller effect compared to unsaturated NAEs. N-Ara and N-Ole were found to decrease ROS formation, apparently due to their uncoupling action. However, under specific conditions, N-Ara slightly but significantly stimulated ROS generation in uncoupled conditions, probably due to its inhibitory effect on complex I. These results may contribute to our better understanding of physiological roles of NAEs in protection against ischemia and in induction of programmed cell death.

Wnt-3a regulates chondrocyte differentiation via c-Jun/AP-1 pathway.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4837-42.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Our previous study indicated that interleukin (IL)-1beta induces expression of several Wnt proteins in chondrocytes and causes chondrocyte dedifferentiation via the c-Jun/activator protein-1 (AP-1) pathway. This study examined whether Wnt-3a causes chondrocyte dedifferentiation via the c-Jun/AP-1 pathway. Wnt-3a inhibited chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells by stabilizing cell-cell adhesion in a manner independent of beta-catenin transcriptional activity. Wnt-3a also induced dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes by stimulating the transcriptional activity of beta-catenin-T cell-factor/lymphoid-enhancer-factor (Tcf/Lef) complex. In chondrocytes, Wnt-3a caused the expression of c-Jun and its phosphorylation by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), resulting in activation of AP-1. AP-1 activation suppressed the expression of Sox-9, a major transcription factor regulating type II collagen expression. Collectively, our results suggest that Wnt-3a inhibits chondrogenesis by stabilizing cell-cell adhesion and that it causes dedifferentiation of chondrocytes by activating of beta-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional complex and the c-Jun/AP-1 pathway.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4822-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Mutations of SGCE encoding epsilon-sarcoglycan cause myoclonus-dystonia. SGCE is paternally expressed; however, 5-10% of patients show maternal inheritance of the disease. We found Sgce was exclusively paternally expressed in mice by using a novel polymorphism marker. The result was confirmed in Sgce heterozygous knockout mice. This finding suggests that maternally inherited myoclonus-dystonia may not result from maternal expression of SGCE. Furthermore, we report a new family of alternatively spliced Sgce mRNA expressed in the brain coding for different C-terminal sequences possessing a PDZ-binding motif. Our results provide a better basis for diagnosis and understanding of the pathogenesis of myoclonus-dystonia.

Rapid disruption of intestinal barrier function by gliadin involves
altered expression of apical junctional proteins.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4851-5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Coeliac disease is a chronic enteropathy caused by the ingestion of wheat gliadin and other cereal prolamines derived from rye and barley. In the present work, we investigated the mechanisms underlying altered barrier function properties exerted by gliadin-derived peptides in human Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. We demonstrate that gliadin alters barrier function almost immediately by decreasing transepithelial resistance and increasing permeability to small molecules (4 kDa). Gliadin caused a reorganisation of actin filaments and altered expression of the tight junction proteins occludin, claudin-3 and claudin-4, the TJ-associated protein ZO-1 and the adherens junction protein E-cadherin.

Modulating furin activity with designed mini-PDX peptides: synthesis and
in vitro kinetic evaluation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4813-21.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A peptide was designed from reactive site loop structure of alpha1 Antitrypsin Portland known as alpha1 PDX as a novel mini-PDX inhibitor of furin. The sequence was derived from (367-394) that contains the crucial furin cleavage motif RIPR382. A P3 mutant replacing Ile380 by Leu was prepared as a first model peptide. A Cys residue was inserted at each terminal of the peptide for purpose of cyclisation which was accomplished by air or iodine-induced oxidation. This mini-PDX peptide both cyclic and acyclic form inhibited in vitro furin activity (IC50 in nM) when measured against either substrates Boc-RVRRdown double arrow MCA or QVEGF-C [Abz-QVHSIIRRdown double arrow SLP-Y(NO2)-A-CONH2, Abz=2-amino benzoic acid and Y(NO2)=3-nitro tyrosine], latter being derived from vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) processing site. The geometrically constrained structure mimicking PDX reactive loop is crucial for enzyme inhibition. Our study further revealed that both mini-PDX peptides inactivate furin in a slow tight binding manner, with disulfide-bridged cyclic form being slightly more potent. Unlike PDX, these peptides inhibit furin via a different mechanistic pathway. The study provides an alternate strategy for development of efficient peptide-based inhibitors of Proprotein Convertases including furin.

Alternative splicing of Slo channel gene programmed by estrogen,

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4856-60.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
STREX alternative-exon adds to Slo channel a phosphorylation sequence that can invert protein kinase A (PKA) regulation from excitatory to inhibitory. Because pregnancy switches Slo responsiveness to PKA from inhibitory to excitatory, we hypothesized that STREX expression diminishes with pregnancy and is regulated by sex hormones. Different from total-rSlo, which is elevated around mid-pregnancy and decreases at term, STREX transcripts progressively decreased with pregnancy near 80% at term. STREX downregulation was mimicked by estrogen, and opposed by estrogen-receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 or progesterone (Pg). The regulation of STREX splicing directed by estrogen and Pg provides a mechanism for Slo's PKA-related phenotypic alteration with pregnancy.

Kruppel-like factor 5 promotes mitosis by activating the cyclin B1/Cdc2
complex during oncogenic Ras-mediated transformation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4757-62.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We previously showed that the zinc finger-containing transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is important in mediating transformation by oncogenic H-Ras through induction of cyclin D1 expression and acceleration of the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. Here we present evidence of a role for KLF5 in accelerating mitotic entry in H-Ras-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts. When compared with non-transformed parental NIH3T3 cells, H-Ras-transformed fibroblasts exhibit an increase in mitotic index, levels of cyclin B1 and Cdc2, and cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase activity. Inhibition of KLF5 expression in H-Ras-transformed cells with KLF5-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) results in a decrease in each of the aforementioned parameters, with a concomitant reduction in the transforming potential of the cells. Conversely, over-expression of KLF5 in NIH3T3 cells leads to an increase in the promoter activity of the genes encoding cyclin B1 and Cdc2. These results indicate that KLF5 accelerates mitotic entry in H-Ras-transformed cells by transcriptionally activating cyclin B1 and Cdc2, which leads to an increase in cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase activity. Extending our previous observation that KLF5 activates cyclin D1 transcription to promote G1/S transition, our current results further support a crucial function for KLF5 in mediating cellular transformation caused by oncogenic H-Ras.

Overview of the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project: results from the pilot phase
with 35 collaborating laboratories and multiple analytical groups,
generating a core dataset of 3020 proteins and a publicly-available

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(13):3226-45.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
HUPO initiated the Plasma Proteome Project (PPP) in 2002. Its pilot phase has (1) evaluated advantages and limitations of many depletion, fractionation, and MS technology platforms; (2) compared PPP reference specimens of human serum and EDTA, heparin, and citrate-anti-coagulated plasma; and (3) created a publicly-available knowledge base (www.bioinformatics.med.umich.edu/hupo/ppp; www.ebi.ac.uk/pride). Thirty-five participating laboratories in 13 countries submitted datasets. Working groups addressed (a) specimen stability and protein concentrations; (b) protein identifications from 18 MS/MS datasets; (c) independent analyses from raw MS-MS spectra; (d) search engine performance, subproteome analyses, and biological insights; (e) antibody arrays; and (f) direct MS/SELDI analyses. MS-MS datasets had 15 710 different International Protein Index (IPI) protein IDs; our integration algorithm applied to multiple matches of peptide sequences yielded 9504 IPI proteins identified with one or more peptides and 3020 proteins identified with two or more peptides (the Core Dataset). These proteins have been characterized with Gene Ontology, InterPro, Novartis Atlas, OMIM, and immunoassay-based concentration determinations. The database permits examination of many other subsets, such as 1274 proteins identified with three or more peptides. Reverse protein to DNA matching identified proteins for 118 previously unidentified ORFs.We recommend use of plasma instead of serum, with EDTA (or citrate) for anticoagulation. To improve resolution, sensitivity and reproducibility of peptide identifications and protein matches, we recommend combinations of depletion, fractionation, and MS/MS technologies, with explicit criteria for evaluation of spectra, use of search algorithms, and integration of homologous protein matches.This Special Issue of PROTEOMICS presents papers integral to the collaborative analysis plus many reports of supplementary work on various aspects of the PPP workplan. These PPP results on complexity, dynamic range, incomplete sampling, false-positive matches, and integration of diverse datasets for plasma and serum proteins lay a foundation for development and validation of circulating protein biomarkers in health and disease.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The pilot phase of the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project (PPP) is an international collaboration to catalog the protein composition of human blood plasma and serum by analyzing standardized aliquots of reference serum and plasma specimens using a variety of experimental techniques. Data management for this project included collection, integration, analysis, and dissemination of findings from participating organizations world-wide. Accomplishing this task required a communication and coordination infrastructure specific enough to support meaningful integration of results from all participants, but flexible enough to react to changing requirements and new insights gained during the course of the project and to allow participants with varying informatics capabilities to contribute. Challenges included integrating heterogeneous data, reducing redundant information to minimal identification sets, and data annotation. Our data integration workflow assembles a minimal and representative set of protein identifications, which account for the contributed data. It accommodates incomplete concordance of results from different laboratories, ambiguity and redundancy in contributed identifications, and redundancy in the protein sequence databases. Recommendations of the PPP for future large-scale proteomics endeavors are described.

Proteomics. 2005 Aug;5(13):3506-19.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The data collected by Human Proteome Organization's Plasma Proteome Pilot project phase was analyzed by members of our working group. Accordingly, a functional annotation of the human plasma proteome was carried out. Here, we report the findings of our analyses. First, bioinformatic analyses were undertaken to determine the likely sources of plasma proteins and to develop a protein interaction network of proteins identified in this project. Second, annotation of these proteins was performed in the context of functional subproteomes involved in the coagulation pathway, the mononuclear phagocytic system, the inflammation pathway, the cardiovascular system, and the liver; as well as the subset of proteins associated with DNA binding activities. Our analyses contributed to the Plasma Proteome Database (http://www.plasmaproteomedatabase.org), an annotated database of plasma proteins identified by HPPP as well as from other published studies. In addition, we address several methodological considerations including the selective enrichment of post-translationally modified proteins by the use of multi-lectin chromatography as well as the use of peptidomic techniques to characterize the low molecular weight proteins in plasma. Furthermore, we have performed additional analyses of peptide identification data to annotate cleavage of signal peptides, sites of intra-membrane proteolysis and post-translational modifications. The HPPP-organized, multi-laboratory effort, as described herein, resulted in much synergy and was essential to the success of this project.

<ABSTRACT>
One of the major challenges facing protein analysis is the dynamic range of protein expression within massively complex samples (Corthals, G. L. et al.., Electrophoresis 2000, 21, 1104-1115). In plasma this difference is as great as ten orders of magnitude, and this is currently beyond the range of detection achievable by any of the analytical techniques. Plasma has the additional challenge of having a few highly abundant proteins, such as albumin, which mask the detection of lower abundance and biologically significant proteins. The use of the Gradiflow BF400 as a fractionation tool to deplete highly abundant albumin from human plasma is reported here. A sequential three-step protocol was performed on five plasma samples as part of the International Plasma Proteome Project organised by the HUPO; four containing different anticoagulants: EDTA, citrate, heparin and a control sample (NIBSC); and a serum sample. Plasma from an alternate source also underwent fractionation and served as an in-house control. Time modulation between 1 and 7 h was observed for the depletion of albumin from these samples. Following albumin depletion, each fraction was trypsin-digested and the peptides were fractionated further using a 2-D LC-MS/MS. Differences in the total number of proteins identified for each sample were also noted.

A novel strong competitive inhibitor of complex I.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4861-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Alkaline incubation of NADH results in the formation of a very potent inhibitor of complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase). Mass spectroscopy (molecular mass equal to 696) and absorption spectroscopy suggest that the inhibitor is derived from attachment of two oxygen atoms to the nicotinamide moiety of NADH. The inhibitor is competitive with respect to NADH with a K(i) of about 10(-8)M. The inhibitor efficiently suppresses NADH-oxidase, NADH-artificial acceptor reductase, and NADH-quinone reductase reactions catalyzed by submitochondrial particles, as well as the reactions catalyzed by either isolated complex I or the three subunit flavoprotein fragment of complex I.

<ABSTRACT>
Myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) regulates a broad range of fundamental cellular processes including cell division, differentiation and death. Here, we tested the hypothesis that MEF2A is required in cardiac contractility employing zebrafish as a model organism. MEF2A is highly expressed in heart as well as somites during zebrafish embryogenesis. Knock-down of MEF2A in zebrafish impaires the cardiac contractility and results in sarcomere assembly defects. Dysregulation of cardiac genes in MEF2A morphants suggests that sarcomere assembly disturbances account for the cardiac contractile deficiency. Our studies suggested that MEF2A is essential in cardiac contractility.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The biological effect of radiofrequency (RF) fields remains controversial. We address this issue by examining whether RF fields can cause changes in gene expression. We used the pulsed RF fields at a frequency of 2.45 GHz that is commonly used in telecommunication to expose cultured human HL-60 cells. We used the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) method to measure the RF effect on gene expression at the genome level. We observed that 221 genes altered their expression after a 2-h exposure. The number of affected genes increased to 759 after a 6-h exposure. Functional classification of the affected genes reveals that apoptosis-related genes were among the upregulated ones and the cell cycle genes among the downregulated ones. We observed no significant increase in the expression of heat shock genes. These results indicate that the RF fields at 2.45 GHz can alter gene expression in cultured human cells through non-thermal mechanism.

Recombinant ferritin from Pyrococcus furiosus expressed in Escherichia coli exhibits in EPR monitored redox titrations a mixed valence (Fe(3+)-Fe2+) S=1/2 signal at intermediate potentials that is a high-resolution homolog of the ferroxidase signal previously described for reconstituted horse spleen apo-ferritin. P. furiosus reconstituted apo-ferritin reduced to intermediate potentials exhibits the same mixed-valence signal, which integrates to close to one spin per subunit. The reduction potentials of +210 and +50 mV imply that the iron dimer is a stable prosthetic group with three redox states.

<ABSTRACT>
We investigated the effect of several amino acids on the secretion of such inflammatory cytokines as interleukin-8 (IL-8) induced by hydrogen peroxide or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in intestinal epithelial-like Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. We found that histidine, one of the conditionally essential amino acids, significantly inhibited both hydrogen peroxide- and TNF-alpha-induced IL-8 secretion and mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells and HT-29 cells. These inhibitions were dose dependent and the inhibition rate of hydrogen peroxide-induced IL-8 secretion reached more than 50% at a concentration of 25mM, with over 95% inhibition at a concentration of 50mM. TNF-alpha increased the transcriptional activity of the IL-8 promoter which was significantly inhibited by treating Caco-2 cells with histidine. Histidine also abolished the NF-kappaB-dependent activation of the IL-8 promoter induced by TNF-alpha. These results indicate that histidine inhibited the hydrogen peroxide- and TNF-alpha-induced IL-8 secretion at the transcriptional level in intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting that histidine has the potential to attenuate intestinal inflammation.

<ABSTRACT>
LEAFY COTYLEDON 2 (LEC2) is a key regulator of seed maturation in Arabidopsis. To unravel some of its complex pleiotropic functions, analyses were performed with transgenic plants expressing an inducible LEC2:GR protein. The chimeric protein is functional and can complement lec2 mutation. Interestingly, the induction of LEC2 leads to the accumulation of storage oil in leaves. In addition, short-term induction and use of translation inhibitors allowed to demonstrate that LEC2 can directly trigger the accumulation of seed specific mRNAs. Consistent with these results, the expression of three other major seed regulators namely, LEC1, FUS3, and ABI3 were also induced by LEC2 activation.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4897-902.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated in all oxygen-utilizing organisms. Peroxiredoxin II (Prx II) as one of antioxidant enzymes may play a protective role against the oxidative damage caused by ROS. In order to define the role of Prx II in organismal aging, we evaluated cellular senescence in Prx II(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF). As compared to wild type MEF, cellular senescence was accelerated in Prx II(-/-) MEF. Senescence-associated (SA)-beta-galactosidase (Gal)-positive cell formation was about 30% higher in Prx II(-/-) MEF. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) treatment attenuated SA-beta-Gal-positive cell formation. Prx II(-/-) MEF exhibited the higher G2/M (41%) and lower S (1.6%) phase cells as compared to 24% and 7.3% [corrected] in wild type MEF, respectively. A high increase in the p16 and a slight increase in the p21 and p53 levels were detected in PrxII(-/-) MEF cells. The cellular senescence of Prx II(-/-) MEF was correlated with the organismal aging of Prx II(-/-) mouse skin. While extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 activation was detected in Prx II(-/-) MEF, ERK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation was detected in Prx II(-/-) skin. These results suggest that Prx II may function as an enzymatic antioxidant to prevent cellular senescence and skin aging.

<ABSTRACT>
Plant and fungal mitochondria contain type II fatty acid synthesis systems closely related to those of bacteria in which the individual reactions are catalyzed by separate soluble proteins acting on intermediates bound to acyl carrier protein (ACP). Mammalian mitochondria are thought to synthesize fatty acids, but evidence for the key ACP component was lacking since the only reported ACP was the SDAP subunit of the membrane-bound NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, We report that most of the SDAP is found in the soluble (matrix) fraction of bovine heart mitochondria and is therefore available to carry the intermediates of type II fatty acid synthesis.

<ABSTRACT>
The cold-induced wheat WCSP1 protein belongs to the cold shock domain (CSD) protein family. In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the CSD functions as a nucleic acid-binding domain. Here, we demonstrated that purified recombinant WCSP1 is boiling soluble and binds ss/dsDNA and mRNA. Furthermore, boiled-WCSP1 retained its characteristic nucleic acid-binding activity. A WCSP1 deletion mutant, containing only a CSD, lost ssDNA/RNA-binding activity; while a mutant containing the CSD and the first glycine-rich region (GR) displayed the activity. These data indicated that the first GR of WCSP1 is necessary for the binding activity but is not for the heat stability of the protein.

<ABSTRACT>
We show that the thylakoid membrane phosphoprotein TMP14 is a novel subunit of plant photosystem I (PSI). Blue native/SDS-PAGE and sucrose gradient fractionation demonstrated the association of the protein exclusively with PSI. We designate the protein PSI-P. The presence of PSI-P subunit in Arabidopsis mutants lacking other PSI subunits was analyzed and suggested a location in the proximity of PSI-L, -H and -O subunits. The PSI-P protein was not differentially phosphorylated in state 1 and state 2.

<ABSTRACT>
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by base-pairing to mRNAs. Hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in various multicellular organisms and many miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved. Although the biological functions of most miRNAs are unknown, miRNAs are predicted to regulate up to 30% of the genes within the human genome. Gradually, we are beginning to understand the functions of individual miRNAs and the general function of miRNA action. Here, we review the recent advances in miRNA biology in animals. Particularly, we focus on the roles of miRNAs in vertebrate development and disease.

Differential regulation of dual NADPH oxidases/peroxidases, Duox1 and
Duox2, by Th1 and Th2 cytokines in respiratory tract epithelium.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4911-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Partially reduced metabolites of molecular oxygen, superoxide (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are detected in respiratory tract lining fluid, and it is assumed that these are key components of innate immunity. Whether these reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced specifically by the respiratory epithelium in response to infection, or are a non-specific by-product of oxidant-producing inflammatory cells is not well characterized. Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that the dual function NAD(P)H oxidases/peroxidases, Duox1 and Duox2, are important sources of regulated H2O2 production in respiratory tract epithelium. However, no studies to date have characterized the regulation of Duox gene expression. Accordingly, we examined Duox1 and Duox2 mRNA expression by real-time PCR in primary respiratory tract epithelial cultures after treatment with multiple cytokines. Herein, we determined that Duox1 expression was increased several-fold by treatment with the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, whereas Duox2 expression was highly induced following treatment with the Th1 cytokine IFN-gamma. Duox2 expression was also elevated by polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and rhinovirus infection. Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI)-inhibitable apical H2O2 production was similarly increased by the addition of Th1 or Th2 cytokines. These results demonstrate for the first time the regulation of Duox expression by immunomodulatory Th1 and Th2 cytokines, and suggest a mechanism by which ROS production can be regulated in the respiratory tract as part of the host defense response.

Characterization of acetohydroxyacid synthase from Mycobacterium

screening of a chemical library.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4903-10.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) is a thiamin diphosphate- (ThDP-) and FAD-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the first common step in the biosynthetic pathway of the branched-amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine. The genes of AHAS from Mycobacterium tuberculosis were cloned, and overexpressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. The purified AHAS from M. tuberculosis is effectively inhibited by pyrazosulfuron ethyl (PSE), an inhibitor of plant AHAS enzyme, with the IC(50) (inhibitory concentration 50%) of 0.87 microM. The kinetic parameters of M. tuberculosis AHAS were determined, and an enzyme activity assay system using 96-well microplate was designed. After screening of a chemical library composed of 5600 compounds using the assay system, a new class of AHAS inhibitor was identified with the IC(50) in the range of 1.8-2.6 microM. One of the identified compounds (KHG20612) further showed growth inhibition activity against various strains of M. tuberculosis. The correlation of the inhibitory activity of the identified compound against AHAS to the cell growth inhibition activity suggested that AHAS might be served as a target protein for the development of novel anti-tuberculosis therapeutics.

Proteasome comprising a beta1 inducible subunit acts as a negative

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Aug 29;579(21):4879-86.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Elicitation of defense reactions in tobacco by cryptogein, triggered a production of active oxygen species (AOS) via the NADPH oxidase, NtrbohD, and an accumulation of beta1din, a defense induced beta-type subunit of 20S proteasome. The proteasome inhibitor, MG132, stimulated this AOS production. Tobacco cells transformed with sense constructs of beta1din showed an inhibition of the AOS production following elicitin treatment, whereas the antisense transformed cells showed a strongly enhanced AOS production. In cells transformed with sense construct of beta1din, the NtrbohD transcripts failed to be induced by cryptogein as observed in control and antisense transformed cells. Conversely, in tobacco cells transformed with antisense constructs for NtrbohD, beta1din transcripts remained at a low level after elicitation. These results constitute the first demonstration of proteasome comprising beta1din acting as a negative regulator of NtrbohD and contributes to the regulation of AOS generation during plant defense reactions.

Free uptake of cell-penetrating peptides by fission yeast.

<ABSTRACT>
An increasing number of peptides translocate the plasma membrane of mammalian cells promising new avenues for drug delivery. However, only a few examples are known to penetrate the fungal cell wall. We compared the capacity of different fluorophore-labelled peptides to translocate into fission yeast and human cells and determined their intracellular distribution. Most of the 20 peptides tested were able to enter human cells, but only one, transportan 10 (TP10), efficiently penetrated fission yeast and was distributed uniformly inside the cells. The results show that the fungal cell wall may reduce, but does not block peptide uptake.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In this study, we have identified 876 polymorphism sites in 145 complete or partial genomes of SARS-CoV available in the NCBI GenBank. One hundred and seventy-four of these sites existed in two or more SARS-CoV genome sequences. According to the sequence polymorphism, all SARS-CoVs can be divided into three groups: (I) group 1, animal-origin viruses (such as SARS-CoV SZ1, SZ3, SZ13 and SZ16); (II) group 2, all viruses with clinical origin during first epidemic; and (III) group 3, SARS-CoV GD03T0013. According to 10 special loci, group 2 again can be divided into genotypes C and T, which can be further divided into sub-genotypes C1-C4 and T1-T4. Positive Darwinian selections were identified between any pair of these three groups. Genotype C gives neutral selection. Genotype T, however, shows negative selection. By comparing the death rates of SARS patients in the different regions, it was found that the death rate caused by the viruses of the genotype C was lower than that of the genotype T. SARS-CoVs might originate from an unknown ancestor.

Inhibition of the osteoclast V-ATPase by small interfering RNAs.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 12;579(22):4937-42.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The multisubunit enzyme V-ATPase harbours isoforms of individual subunits. a3 is one of four 116 kDa subunit a isoforms, and it is crucial for bone resorption. We used small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules to knock down a3 in rat osteoclast cultures. Labeled siRNA-molecules entered osteoclasts via endocytosis and knocked down the a3 mRNA. Bone resorption was decreased in siRNA-treated samples due to decreased acidification and osteoclast inactivation. Expression of a1 did not respond to decreased a3 levels, suggesting that a1 does not compensate for a3 in osteoclast cultures. Subunit a3 is thus an interesting target for novel nucleic acid therapy.

A role for K268 in V2R folding.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 12;579(22):4985-90.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The V2 vasopressin receptor, a member of the rhodopsin subfamily of GPCRs, mediates arginine vasopressin control of water reabsorption in the kidney by activating Gs. Requirement of the third intracellular loop of the V2R for G(s) activation was identified by introducing V2R segments into the Gq coupled V1aR [Liu, J. and Wess, J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 8772-8778]; the same approach recognized glutamate 231 and glutamine 225 at the amino terminus of loop 3i as being needed for signal transduction. Site-directed mutagenesis of the V2R confirmed their observations. Recently, we found that a positively charged amino acid at codon 268 is essential for V2R expression, although a double-mutant bearing lysine at position 231 and glutamic acid at position 268 was expressed at higher levels than the wild type V2R and displayed unchanged ligand-binding affinity. Ligand-induced internalization and phosphorylation of the double-mutant receptor was indistinguishable from that observed with the wild type protein but signaling activity was greatly diminished. The data suggested these two amino acids might interact with each other and might play a role in promoting GDP/GTP exchange.

Localization of a putative ClC chloride channel in spinach chloroplasts.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 12;579(22):4991-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Seven genes seem to encode for putative ClC chloride channels (AtClC-a to AtClC-g) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Their function and localization is still largely unknown. AtClC-f shares considerable sequence similarity with putative ClC channel proteins from Synechocystis, considered to represent the precursor of chloroplasts. We show by biochemical and mass spectrometry analysis that ClC-f is located in the outer envelope membrane of spinach chloroplasts. Consistent with the plastidial localization of ClC-f, p-chlorophenoxy-acetic acid (CPA) reduces photosynthetic activity and the protein is expressed in etioplasts and chloroplasts but not in root tissue. These findings may represent a step toward the molecular identification of ion channel activities in chloroplast membranes.

<ABSTRACT>
Coat proteins (CPs) of plant viruses are involved in different stages of the viral life cycle such as virion assembly, replication, movement, vector transmission, and regulation of host defense responses. Here, we report that the CPs of two filamentous RNA viruses, potato virus X (PVX, Potexvirus) and potato virus A (PVA, Potyvirus) exhibit an enzyme activity. The CP isolated from PVX virions possesses ATP-binding and ATPase activities. Recombinant PVX and PVA CPs produced in Escherichia coli show Mg2+-dependent ATPase and UTPase activities inhibited by antibodies against virus particles. Deletion of the C-terminal regions of these proteins diminishes their ATPase activity.

Gene induction by desiccation stress in human cell cultures.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 12;579(22):4973-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
One strategy for investigating desiccation tolerance is to use mammalian cells, which are sensitive to desiccation, as a model for testing putative adaptive mechanisms. However, how mammalian cells themselves respond to desiccation is poorly characterised. Although MAPK signal transduction pathways are activated by desiccation of human cells, hypertonicity-responsive genes AR, BGT1 and SMIT are not significantly induced, although they are proposed to be regulated by physiological changes which should occur during drying. To determine whether a response to desiccation occurs at the transcriptional level in human cells, we performed genome-wide microarray analysis. Twenty upregulated genes, including early stress response and transcription factor genes, were identified, most of which, e.g., EGR1, EGR3, SNAI1, RASD1 and GADD45B, were also induced by hypertonicity, indicating common regulatory mechanisms. Our data suggest that human cells can initiate a complex desiccation stress response distinct from, but overlapping with, that to hypertonic stress.

<ABSTRACT>
We developed a transgenic (Tg) rat model that overexpresses human proadrenomedullin N-terminal 20 peptide (PAMP) only and then compared the effects of unilateral nephrectomy followed by a high salt diet for five weeks in Tg and wild-type rats. We found that systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in Tg UNX rats and cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis was also attenuated in Tg rats. Evaluation of gene expression showed suppression of cardiac local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in Tg rat. These results suggest that in addition to reducing blood pressure, PAMP suppresses cardiac hypertrophy through negative regulation of the local cardiac RAS.

Epac1 regulates integrity of endothelial cell junctions through
VE-cadherin.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 12;579(22):4966-72.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have previously shown that Rap1 as well as its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac1 increases cell-cell junction formation. Here, we show that activation of Epac1 with the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac)-specific cAMP analog 8CPT-2'O-Me-cAMP (007) resulted in a tightening of the junctions and a decrease in the permeability of the endothelial cell monolayer. In addition, 007 treatment resulted in the breakdown of actin stress fibers and the formation of cortical actin. These effects were completely inhibited by siRNA against Epac1. In VE-cadherin knock-out cells Epac1 did not affect cell permeability, whereas in cells re-expressing VE-cadherin this effect was restored. Finally, the effect of Epac activation on the actin cytoskeleton was independent of junction formation. From these results we conclude that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells Epac1 controls VE-cadherin-mediated cell junction formation and induces reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

This review focuses on the potential therapeutic use of RNAi, discussing the theoretical advantages of RNAi-based therapeutics over previous technologies as well as the challenges involved in developing RNAi for clinical use. Also reviewed, are the in vivo proof-of principle experiments that provide the preclinical justification for the continued development of RNAi-based therapeutics.

Control of p53 nuclear accumulation in stressed cells.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 12;579(22):4978-84.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Wild-type p53 accumulates in the nucleus following stress. Current models suggest this nuclear accumulation involves phosphorylation at p53 N-terminal sites, and inhibition of murine double minute (MDM)2-dependent nuclear export. We monitored the effects of stress on MDM2-dependent nuclear export of wild-type p53 and a mutant lacking N-terminal phosphorylation sites. Etoposide and ionizing radiation inhibited nuclear export of wild-type p53 and the phosphor-mutant to comparable extents, indicating nuclear export inhibition does not require N-terminal phosphorylation. Cytoplasmic p53 accumulated in the nucleus of transfected cells treated with the nuclear export-inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB). Interestingly, LMB caused less p53 nuclear accumulation than stress treatment, suggesting stress-induced nuclear accumulation of p53 does not result solely from inhibited nuclear export.

<ABSTRACT>
Induction of type-IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IIA) expression by bacterial components other than lipopolysaccharide has not been previously investigated. Here, we show that exposure of alveolar macrophages (AM) to Neisseria meningitidis or its lipooligosaccharide (LOS) induced sPLA2-IIA synthesis. However, N. meningitidis mutant devoid of LOS did not abolish this effect. In addition, a pili-defective mutant exhibited significantly lower capacity to stimulate sPLA2-IIA synthesis than the wild-type strain. Moreover, pili isolated from a LOS-defective strain induced sPLA2-IIA expression and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation. These data suggest that pili are potent inducers of sPLA2-IIA expression by AM, through a NF-kappaB-dependent process.

<ABSTRACT>
In this study, to reduce the number of major plasma components, we examined thermostable plasma fractions to search for a biomarker of ovarian cancer. An apparent cancer biomarker of 11.7 kDa was detected in these fractions using ProteinChip SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry system. This peak invariably appeared with another close peak of about 11.5 kDa, suggesting that it is a derivative of a larger mass molecule. Of 27 cancer plasma specimens, 15 (55.6%) demonstrated this peak pair, whereas only 2 of 34 controls specimens (5.8%) were shown to express it with low intensity. Using a method involving cysteine modification by 4-vinylpyridine (4-VP), 2-DE and HPLC, these peaks were identified by mass spectrometry as serum amyloid A1 (11.68 kDa) and its N-terminal arginine-truncated form (11.52 kDa).

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
2-DE followed by MALDI-TOF was used to purify and identify a Drosophila protein (catalogued as SSP 6002) that showed marked differences in the level of expression in the different imaginal discs of third instar larvae. Fingerprinting showed that the spot of interest was the heat shock 23 polypeptide (hsp23). We characterized the kinetics of its induction by heat shock in wing imaginal discs and raised an antiserum against the denatured protein, which recognizes a single unphosphorylated spot on 2-D gels. The difference in its expression in discs was corroborated by analyzing its level in the imaginal discs of postbithorax mutants. We also investigated the developmental expression of hsp23 in imaginal discs with antiserum raised against the native protein. Its spatial and temporal pattern of expression is related to the proneural territories and maintained even under heat shock conditions. In addition, its pattern of expression is regulated by transcription factors and signaling pathways (notch and epidermal growth factor receptor) involved in proneural specification.

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3684-95.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The recently published genome sequence of Bacillus anthracis Ames has facilitated the prediction of proteins associated with the virulence of this bacterium. The aim of this study was to define reference maps for the extracellular and cytoplasmic proteomes of the avirulent B. anthracis strain UM23C1-2 that are useful for physiological studies and the development of improved vaccines. Using 2-DE and subsequent MALDI-TOF-TOF MS, 64 proteins were identified in the extracellular proteome, only 29 of which were predicted to be exported into the culture medium. The latter included chitinases, proteases, nucleotidases, sulfatases, phosphatases and proteins of unknown function. Of the remaining proteins in the culture medium, 18 were predicted to be associated with the cell wall or anchored on the trans side of the cytoplasmic membrane while 17 other proteins lacked identifiable export signals and were predicted to be cytoplasmic proteins. Among the S-layer proteins, Sap and Eag account for 10% of the total extracellular proteome. Many of the proteins are predicted to contribute to the virulence and antigenic signature of B. anthracis. We have also studied the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome, identifying 300 distinct proteins. The most abundant cytoplasmic proteins are primarily those involved in glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, protein translation, protein folding and stress adaptation. The presence of a variety of proteases, peptidases, peptide binding proteins, as well as enzymes required for the metabolism of amino acids, suggests that B. anthracis is adapted to life in a protein-rich environment rather than the soil. We therefore speculate that proteases and peptidases could be useful targets for the development of improved vaccines. In addition, both of these B. anthracis compartment-specific proteomes can be used as reference maps to monitor changes in the production of secreted and cytosolic proteins that occur, for example, during growth in macrophages.

<ABSTRACT>
Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) pollen (BGP) is one of the most common causes of airway allergic disease, and has been shown to contain over 12 allergenic proteins on 1-D immunoglobulin E (IgE) immunoblots. However, only a few allergens have been identified and characterized. Cyn d 1 is a major allergen and the most abundant protein in BGP, representing 15% of the whole-pollen extract. To investigate variability in the IgE-reactive patterns of BGP-sensitized patients and to identify other prevalent allergens, a BGP extract was passed through an affinity column to remove Cyn d 1, and the non-bound material was collected and analyzed by 2-DE. IgE-reactive proteins were subsequently characterized by immunoblotting using serum samples from ten BGP-allergic patients. The prevalent IgE-reactive proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF MS, N-terminal sequence similarity, and LC-MS/MS. Here, we present a sub-proteome approach for allergen investigation and its use for determining BGP 2-DE profiles and identifying six novel allergens.

<ABSTRACT>
The MultiTag method (Sunyaev et al., Anal. Chem. 2003 15, 1307-1315) employs multiple error-tolerant searches with peptide sequence tags (Mann and Wilm, Anal. Chem. 1994, 66, 4390-4399) for the identification of proteins from organisms with unsequenced genomes. Here we demonstrate that the error-tolerant capabilities of MultiTag increased the number of peptide alignments and improved the confidence of identifications in an EST database. The MultiTag outperformed conventional database searching software that only utilizes stringent matching of tandem mass spectra to nucleotide sequences of ESTs.

<ABSTRACT>
Human Topors, which was originally identified as cellular binding partner of DNA topoisomerase I and of p53, has recently been shown to function as an ubiquitin E3 ligase for p53 in a manner dependent on its N'-terminally located RING finger. Here, we demonstrate that Topors also enhances the conjugation of the small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1) to p53 in vivo and in a reconstituted in vitro system. The Topors SUMO-1 E3 ligase activity does not depend upon its RING finger motif. In HeLa cells, Topors induced p53 sumoylation was accompanied by an increase in endogenous p53 protein levels. Furthermore, Topors enhances the sumoylation of a variety of other, yet unidentified, cellular proteins.

T-box and homeobox genes from the ctenophore Pleurobrachia pileus:
comparison of Brachyury, Tbx2/3 and Tlx in basal metazoans and
bilaterians.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 12;579(22):5024-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Most animals are classified as Bilateria and only four phyla are still extant as outgroups, namely Porifera, Placozoa, Cnidaria and Ctenophora. These non-bilaterians were not considered to have a mesoderm and hence mesoderm-specific genes. However, the T-box gene Brachyury could be isolated from sponges, placozoans and cnidarians. Here, we describe the first Brachyury and a Tbx2/3 homologue from a ctenophore. In addition, analysing T-box and homeobox genes under comparable conditions in all four basal phyla lead to the discovery of novel T-box genes in sponges and cnidarians and a Tlx homeobox gene in the ctenophore Pleurobrachia pileus. The conservation of the T-box and the homeobox genes suggest that distinct subfamilies with different roles in bilaterians were already split in non-bilaterians.

Vitellogenin regulates hormonal dynamics in the worker caste of a eusocial
insect.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 12;579(22):4961-5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Functionally sterile honey bee workers synthesize the yolk protein vitellogenin while performing nest tasks. The subsequent shift to foraging is linked to a reduced vitellogenin and an increased juvenile hormone (JH) titer. JH is a principal controller of vitellogenin expression and behavioral development. Yet, we show here that silencing of vitellogenin expression causes a significant increase in JH titer and its putative receptor. Mathematically, the increase corresponds to a dynamic dose-response. This role of vitellogenin in the tuning of the endocrine system is uncommon and may elucidate how an ancestral pathway of fertility regulation has been remodeled into a novel circuit controlling social behavior.

Up- and downregulated genes in muscles that undergo developmentally
programmed cell death in the insect Manduca sexta.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 12;579(22):4943-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
This study was designed to investigate changes in gene expression associated with stage-specific programmed cell death (PCD) in intersegmental muscles (ISMs) of the moth, Manduca sexta. The technique of differential display reverse transcription PCR was applied to compare mRNA levels before and after the onset of PCD in ISMs. Expression of E75B transcription factor was repressed while another factor, betaFTZ-F1, stayed at a very low level. However, gene coding for a translation-initiation factor (eIF1A) was upregulated. Expression of these genes had not been previously reported to be altered in dying ISMs. An ecdysteroid agonist, RH-5849, that prevented PCD in ISMs also blocked these changes.

<ABSTRACT>
The small molecule coralyne was found to bind preferentially and strongly to single-stranded poly(A) with an apparent association constant (Ka) of (1.8+/-0.3) x 10(6)M(-1). Binding of coralyne to poly(A) is predominantly enthalpically driven with a stoichiometry of one coralyne per four adenine bases. Poly(A) forms a coralyne dependent secondary structure with a melting temperature of 60 degrees C, for the conditions of our study.

Large-scale protein expression for proteome research.

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3571-80.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Access to pure and soluble recombinant proteins is essential for numerous applications in proteome research, such as the production of antibodies, structural characterization of proteins, and protein microarrays. Through the German cDNA Consortium we have access to more than 1500 ORFs encoding uncharacterized proteins. Preparing a large number of recombinant proteins calls for the careful refinement and re-evaluation of protein purification tools. The expression and purification strategy should result in mg quantities of protein that can be employed in microarray-based assays. In addition, the experimental set-up should be robust enough to allow both automated protein expression screening and the production of the proteins on a mg scale. These requirements are best fulfilled by a bacterial expression system such as Escherichia coli. To develop an efficient expression strategy, 75 different ORFs were transferred into suitable expression vectors using the Gateway cloning system. Four different fusion tags (E. coli transcription-termination anti-termination factor (NusA), hexahistidine tag (6xHis), maltose binding protein (MBP) and GST) were analyzed for their effect on yield of induced fusion protein and its solubility, as determined at two different induction temperatures. Affinity-purified fusion proteins were confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS.

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3731-51.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Wood is one of our most important natural resources. Surprisingly, we know hardly anything about the details of the process of wood formation. The aim of this work was to describe the main proteins expressed in wood forming tissue of a conifer species (Pinus pinaster Ait.). Using high resolution 2-DE with linear pH gradient ranging from 4 to 7, a total of 1039 spots were detected. Out of the 240 spots analyzed by MS/MS, 67.9% were identified, 16.7% presented no homology in the databases, and 15.4% corresponded to protein mixtures. Out of the 57 spots analyzed by MALDI-MS, only 15.8% were identified. Most of the 175 identified proteins play a role in either defense (19.4%), carbohydrates (16.6%) and amino acid (14.9%) metabolisms, genes and proteins expression (13.1%), cytoskeleton (8%), cell wall biosynthesis (5.7%), secondary (5.1%) and primary (4%) metabolisms. A summary of the identified proteins, their putative functions, and behavior in different types of wood are presented. This information was introduced into the PROTICdb database and is accessible at http://cbib1.cbib.u-bordeaux2.fr/Protic/Protic/home/index.php. Finally, the average protein amount was compared with their respective transcript abundance as quantified through EST counting in a cDNA-library constructed with mRNA extracted from wood forming tissue.

Proteomic analysis of carbohydrate catabolism and regulation in the marine

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3672-83.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The marine bacterium Rhodopirellula baltica is a model organism for aerobic carbohydrate degradation in marine systems, where polysaccharides represent the dominant components of biomass. On the basis of the genome sequence and a 2-D map of soluble proteins, the central catabolic routes of R. baltica were reconstructed. Almost all enzymes of glycolysis and TCA cycle were identified. In addition, almost all enzymes of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate cycle were detected. This proteomic reconstruction was corroborated by determination of selected enzymatic activities. To study substrate-dependent regulation in R. baltica, cells were adapted to growth with eight different carbohydrates and profiled with 2-DE for changes in protein patterns. Relative abundances of regulated proteins were determined using the 2-D DIGE technology and protein identification was achieved by PMF. Most of the up-regulated proteins were either dehydrogenases/oxidoreductases or proteins of unknown function which are unique for R. baltica. For only some of the regulated proteins, the coding genes are located in a physiologically meaningful genomic context. e.g., a ribose-induced alcohol dehydrogenase is encoded within an operon-like structure together with genes coding for a ribose-specific ABC-transporter. However, most of the regulated genes are randomly distributed across the genome.

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3654-71.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The marine bacterium Rhodopirellula baltica, a member of the phylum Planctomycetes, has distinct morphological properties and contributes to remineralization of biomass in the natural environment. On the basis of its recently determined complete genome we investigated its proteome by 2-DE and established a reference 2-DE gel for the soluble protein fraction. Approximately 1000 protein spots were excised from a colloidal Coomassie-stained gel (pH 4-7), analyzed by MALDI-MS and identified by PMF. The non-redundant data set contained 626 distinct protein spots, corresponding to 558 different genes. The identified proteins were classified into role categories according to their predicted functions. The experimentally determined and the theoretically predicted proteomes were compared. Proteins, which were most abundant in 2-DE gels and the coding genes of which were also predicted to be highly expressed, could be linked mainly to housekeeping functions in glycolysis, tricarboxic acid cycle, amino acid biosynthesis, protein quality control and translation. Absence of predictable signal peptides indicated a localization of these proteins in the intracellular compartment, the pirellulosome. Among the identified proteins, 146 contained a predicted signal peptide suggesting their translocation. Some proteins were detected in more than one spot on the gel, indicating post-translational modification. In addition to identifying proteins present in the published sequence database for R. baltica, an alternative approach was used, in which the mass spectrometric data was searched against a maximal ORF set, allowing the identification of four previously unpredicted ORFs. The 2-DE reference map presented here will serve as framework for further experiments to study differential gene expression of R. baltica in response to external stimuli or cellular development and compartmentalization.

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3765-77.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Understanding the development of the malaria parasite within the mosquito vector at the molecular level should provide novel targets for interrupting parasitic life cycle and subsequent transmission. Availability of the complete genomic sequence of the major African malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, allows discovery of such targets through experimental as well as computational methods. In the female mosquito, the salivary gland tissue plays an important role in the maturation of the infective form of the malaria parasite. Therefore, we carried out a proteomic analysis of salivary glands from female An. gambiae mosquitoes. Salivary gland extracts were digested with trypsin using two complementary approaches and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. This led to identification of 69 unique proteins, 57 of which were novel. We carried out a functional annotation of all proteins identified in this study through a detailed bioinformatics analysis. Even though a number of cDNA and Edman degradation-based approaches to catalog transcripts and proteins from salivary glands of mosquitoes have been published previously, this is the first report describing the application of MS for characterization of the salivary gland proteome. Our approach should prove valuable for characterizing proteomes of parasites and vectors with sequenced genomes as well as those whose genomes are yet to be fully sequenced.

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3798-804.

<ABSTRACT>
Off-line coupling of capillary IEF (CIEF) with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry was utilized for the analysis of human blood serum. Serum proteins were initially separated by CIEF, and fractions of the isoelectric separation were eluted sequentially to a MALDI-TOF MS sample target. During pressure elution of the CIEF sample, voltage was maintained across the capillary system utilizing a sheath flow arrangement to minimize band broadening induced by the laminar flow field. Both pI and mass information were obtained from the complex biological sample, similar to traditional 2-DE techniques, and the platform was faster (hours versus days), more automatable, and simpler than 2-DE. The volume of raw sample present in the actual analysis was approximately 100 nL, making this technique well suited for very rare specimens. Additionally, the speed and simplicity of the technology make it an attractive technique for performing initial comparative analyses of complex samples.

Proteomic analysis of the porcine interphotoreceptor matrix.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3623-36.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) is located between photoreceptors and pigment epithelium in the retina and is involved in fundamental functions of the visual cycle. These include visual pigment chromophore exchange, retinal adhesion, metabolite trafficking, and growth factor presentation. In general, IPM preparations are contaminated with intracellular proteins, as has also been described for other body fluids. This study aimed at identifying new components of the IPM by discriminating between truly secreted proteins and proteins that are part of the IPM for secondary reasons. "Soluble" porcine IPM was extracted from retina and pigment epithelium with PBS by two different procedures, followed by extraction with water alone that released "insoluble" IPM matrix sheets. Samples from all preparations were separated by 2-DE and a total of 140 protein spots were identified by MALDI-TOF and/or CapLC Q-TOF MS. Although identified proteins included several already known in the IPM, the majority had not been previously described in this structure. Gene ontology classifications allocated the identified proteins into nine different functional networks. The IPM preparations also included intracellular proteins from cells adjacent to the IPM, which may have resulted from cell disruption. This underlines the experimental difficulties of a biochemical analysis of the IPM as an intact compartment. We show here a strategy for predicting the probability of identified IPM proteins occurring in vivo by combined high-resolution protein separation methods with computational prediction methods. Thus, a set of potentially neuroprotective proteins could be extracted, including PEA-15, peroxiredoxin 5, alpha-B-crystallin, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), protein disulfide-isomerase, and PEP-19, which have not been previously associated with the IPM. Furthermore, with immunohistochemical staining we could confirm the localization of GRP78 in the IPM on porcine eye sections, thus validating the proposed prediction method.

Proteomic analysis of global alteration of protein expression in squamous
cell carcinoma of the esophagus.

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3814-21.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (ESCC), a major subtype of esophageal carcinoma, is one of the aggressive cancers with worst prognosis in the world. The dismal outcome of ESCC is attributed to multiple reasons including its aggressive nature, largely unknown molecular mechanism of its progression, and the lack of biomarkers for early detection and effective prediction of its clinical behavior. To identify proteins with prognostic and/or predictive value, we applied a proteomics strategy to quantify proteins differentially expressed in ESCC using matched samples of carcinoma and adjacent normal epithelial cells. The analysis led to identification of 28 proteins aberrantly expressed in cancer cells with changes of at least three-fold in ESCC relative to normal squamous epithelial cells. These changes represent functional alterations of essential proteins for normal cellular physiology, accounting for many cellular changes involved in development of ESCC, including cell transformation, loss of differentiation, tumor growth, apoptosis, tumor invasion, and cell metabolism. The differentially expressed proteins shed new insights on the mechanism of tumorigenesis and provide candidate biomarkers for early detection of ESCC.

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3722-30.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Thermophilic bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus TLS33, isolated from a hot spring in Chiang Mai, Thailand, usually produces many enzymes that are very useful for industrial applications. However, the functional properties and mechanisms of this bacterium under stress conditions are rarely reported and still need more understanding on how the bacterium can survive in stress environments. In this study, we examined the oxidative stress induced proteins of this bacterium by proteomic approach combining two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. When the bacterium encountered oxidative stress, peroxiredoxin, as an antioxidant enzyme, is one of the interesting stressed proteins which appeared to be systematically increased with different pI. There are four isoforms of peroxiredoxin, denoted as Prx I, Prx II, Prx III and Prx IV, which are observed at the same molecular weight of 27 kDa but differ in pI values of 5.0, 4.87, 4.81 and 4.79, respectively. The H2O2 concentration directly increased Prx II, Prx III and Prx IV intensities, but decreased Prx I intensity. These shifting of peroxiredoxin isoforms may occur by a post-translational modification. Otherwise, the longer time of oxidative stress had not affected the expression level of peroxiredoxin isoforms. Therefore, this finding of peroxiredoxin intends to know the bacterial adaptation under oxidative stress. Otherwise, this protein plays an important role in many physiological processes and able to use in the industrial applications.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 12;579(22):5029-34.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The polyubiquitin-binding protein p62 has been shown to localize in aggregates common to several types of diseases. Here, we report that p62 forms independent fibrillar aggregates in vitro in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. FTIR spectra and ThT fluorescence assay of p62 reveals increased beta-sheet content as aggregates form compared to the native protein. The fibrillar nature of the aggregates was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Overexpression of p62 in HEK cells results in aggregate formation that may protect cells from apoptosis. Altogether, these results suggest that p62 fibrils may influence cell viability and indicates an important role for p62 in aggresome formation.

<ABSTRACT>
Perlecan is a multidomain proteoglycan, usually substituted with heparan sulphate (HS), and sometimes substituted with both HS and chondroitin sulphate (CS). In this paper, we describe perlecan purified from HEK-293 cells substituted with HS, CS and keratan sulphate (KS). KS substitution was confirmed by immunoreactivity with antibody 5D4, sensitivity to keratanase treatment, and fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis. HEK-293 perlecan failed to promote FGF-dependent cell growth in an in vitro assay. This study is the first to report perlecan containing KS, and makes perlecan one of only a very few proteoglycans substituted with three distinct types of glycosaminoglycan chains.

Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):4012-24.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Carefully controlled ZipTip extraction of diluted human plasma or serum was combined with MALDI-TOF-MS to produce highly reproducible protein profiles. Components detected included apolipoproteins CI, CII and CIII as well as transthyretin and several isoforms of each protein that are created by glycosylation or other modification and by proteolytic processing. Profiles of healthy individuals all contained the same 15 components. Others were found in plasma from individuals with disease. Profiles were analyzed by peak ratios within the same spectrum. Reproducibility for multiple assays was generally 4 to 10%. Within the healthy population, a given peak ratio occurred with a range of about fourfold. However, peak ratios of multiple samples from the same individual showed a much lower range, typically +/-10%. In fact, each individual displayed a personal protein profile that changed very little over time. Because of the stability of protein profiles over time within individuals, these results suggest further studies may discover that certain profile characteristics or changes in an individual's profile may be a sign of current or future disease, even when the altered profile remains within the range for healthy individuals.

<ABSTRACT>
We have undertaken to continue the proteomic study of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using the combination of 2-DE, automated trypsin digestion, and PMF analysis after MALDI-TOF MS and peptide sequencing using nano LC-ESI-MS/MS. The overall functional characterization of the 162 identified proteins from primary cultures of HUVECs confirms the metabolic capabilities of endothelium and illustrates various cellular functions more related to cell motility and angiogenesis, protein folding, anti-oxidant defenses, signal transduction, proteasome pathway and resistance to apoptosis. In comparison with controls cells, the differential proteomic analysis of HUVECs treated by the pro-apoptotic topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide further revealed the variation of eight proteins, namely, GRP78, GRP94, valosin-containing protein, proteinase inhibitor 9, cofilin, 37-kDa laminin receptor protein, bovine apolipoprotein, and tropomyosin. These data suggest that etoposide-induced apoptosis of human vascular endothelial cells results from the intricate involvement of multiple apoptosis processes including at least the mitochondrial and the ER stress pathways. The presented 2-D pattern and protein database, as well as the data related to apoptosis of HUVECs, are available at http://www.huvec.com.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In an attempt to improve the detection of peroxisome proliferation as a biomarker in environmental pollution assessment, we have applied a novel approach based on peroxisomal proteomics. Peroxisomal proteins from digestive glands of mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis were analyzed using 2-DE and MS. We have generated a reference 2-DE map from samples obtained in a well-studied reference area and compared this with peroxisomal proteomes from other sequenced genomes. In addition, by comparing 2-DE maps from control samples with samples obtained in a polluted area, we have characterized the peroxisome proliferation expression pattern associated with exposure to a polluted environment. Over 100 spots were reproducibly resolved per 2-DE map; 55 differentially expressed spots were quantitatively detected and analyzed, and 14 of these showed an increase in protein expression of more than fourfold. Epoxide hydrolase, peroxisomal antioxidant enzyme, and sarcosine oxidase (SOX) have been identified by ESI MS/MS, and acyl-CoA oxidase, multifunctional protein, and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase were immunolocalized by Western blotting. Our results indicate that a peroxisomal protein pattern associated to marine pollutant exposure can be generated, and this approach may have a greater potential as biomarker than traditional, single-protein markers.

Expression of fragile X mental retardation-1 gene with nuclear export

Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):3979-90.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent cause of inherited mental retardation and is largely caused by a loss of expression of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), encoded by fragile X retardation gene-1 (Fmr1). FMRP is a multifunction protein, with intrinsic RNA-binding properties, which is a component of ribonucleoprotein complex associated with polyribosomes. The properties of FMRP indicate that it might participate in post-transcriptional processes in the regulation of some mRNA species, including localization, stability and translational control. However, the function of FMRP related to the pathologenesis in FXS is largely unknown. Many efforts were undertaken to identify the putative specific RNA targets as well as the FMRP-related proteins and to identify the effect of FMRP absence on the corresponding proteins. Here we present our efforts using proteomics approach to explore the differential expression profiling of mouse cerebella immortal cell, in which we changed the expression of FMRP by expressing Fmr1 gene with nuclear export signal (NES) mutation. This mutation makes FMRP unable to shuttle from nucleus to cytoplasm and leads to nuclear instead of cytoplasmic location as usual, which was hypothesized to affect the pathways of groups of RNAs or proteins related with FMRP. In present study, 56 proteins were found to be differentially expressed in transfected R2 neuronal cells, including 16 decreased expressions and 40 increased expressions. The differentially expressed proteins play roles in diverse physiological processes, such as neuronal plasticity, spermatogenesis and craniofacial and limb development etc. In addition, the expressions of three mRNA identified as FMRP targets in fragile X cell were tested in present model cells. All these results provide new insights to the role of FMRP in the disease.

Immunodepletion of albumin for two-dimensional gel detection of new mouse
acute-phase protein and other plasma proteins.

Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):3991-4000.

<ABSTRACT>
Immunodepletion of albumin to improve the 2-D gel resolution of human plasma proteins has recently been described. With the importance of mouse models in many studies in which serum or plasma is often analyzed, we have adopted this approach to immunoprecipitate mouse albumin and evaluated its effectiveness for 2-D separation of mouse plasma proteins. Purified polyclonal antibodies against mouse albumin were effective depleting intact albumin as well as its numerous fragments from mouse plasma samples. Removal of albumin resulted in better resolution of mouse plasma proteins. Three proteins, alpha2-macroglobulin, coagulation factor XII, and hemopexin, that were previously either undetectable or poorly resolved, were identified from albumin-depleted 2-D gels by peptide mass fingerprinting. Albumin depletion also led to partial loss of several other proteins such as clusterin and gelsolin. This loss can be attributed to the interaction with albumin itself because the specificity of the antibody was demonstrated by Western blot. When applying this method to the 2-D separation of plasma from inflamed mouse induced by cutaneous burn injury with superimposed Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, the upregulation of inter alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4 (ITIH4) and hemopexin was unambiguously detected along with other mouse acute-phase proteins (APP), including haptoglobin and serum amyloid A. Based on the significant increase of ITIH4, we propose that this protein is a new member of mouse APP that are upregulated during the inflammatory response.

Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):3864-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A simple procedure was developed for packing PicoFrit HPLC columns with chromatographic stationary phase using a reservoir fabricated from standard laboratory HPLC fittings. Packed columns were mounted onto a stainless steel ultra-low volume precolumn filter assembly containing a 0.5-microm pore size steel frit. This format provided a conduit for the application of the nanospray voltage and protected the column from obstruction by sample material. The system was characterised and operational performance assessed by analysis of a range of peptide standards (n = 9).

Self-made frits for nanoscale columns in proteomics.

Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):3847-50.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We report here the production of self-made frits for nano-columns. The frits introduce a minor dead volume and can be placed in capillaries with a wide range of diameters (20-250 microm tested) in an extremely simple and low-cost procedure. The obtained columns appear to be comparable to "no-frit" columns with near-ideal chromatographic characteristics. We expect that this frit will be useful for the spotting of gradients onto MALDI plates but also where special ESI set-ups do not allow for "no-frit" solutions.

Protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of orphan nuclear receptor TR2:
effects on receptor stability and activity.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):3885-94.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In vivo metabolic labeling showed that orphan nuclear receptor TR2 could be phosphorylated. Systematic studies were conducted using specific kinases/phosphatase inhibitors to determine the enzymes responsible for TR2 phosphorylation and the effects of TR2 phosphorylation on its protein stability and activation of its target gene. The data showed that protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation enhanced the activating ability of TR2 on target gene RARbeta as well as its stability through protection from proteosome-mediated degradation. Several PKC-mediated potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites on TR2 protein were predicted from the computer analysis using NetPhos software (http://us.expasy.org) and were commensurate by in vitro phosphorylation of purified TR2 protein using PKC enzyme. Two phosphorylation sites at Ser-461 and Ser-568 were identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Point mutations at Ser-568 or Ser-461 were prepared and evaluated for their biological activity. Ser-568, but not Ser-461, mutation significantly reduced PKC-mediated TR2 protein stability and its transcriptional activity.

<ABSTRACT>
Two RNA silencing-related phenomena, quelling and meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD) have been identified in the fungus Neurospora crassa. Similar to the case with the siRNA and miRNA pathways in Drosophila, different sets of protein components including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, argonaute and dicer, are used in the quelling and MSUD pathways. Orthologs of the RNA silencing components are found in most, but not all, fungal genomes currently available in the public databases, indicating that the majority of fungi possess the silencing machinery. Advantage and disadvantage of RNA silencing as a tool to explore gene function in fungi are discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
The 4.1 superfamily of proteins contain a 4.1 Ezrin Radixin Moesin (FERM) domain and are described as linking the cytoskeleton with the plasma membrane. Here, we describe a new FERM domain-containing protein called Willin. Willin has a recognizable FERM domain within its N-terminus and is capable of binding phospholipids. Its intra-cellular distribution can be cytoplasmic or at the plasma membrane where it can co-localize with actin. However, the plasma membrane location of Willin is not influenced by cytochalasin D induced actin disruption but it is induced by the addition of epidermal growth factor.

The intracellular concentration of sialic acid regulates the
polysialylation of the neural cell adhesion molecule.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 12;579(22):5079-83.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Sialic acids are expressed as terminal sugars in many glycoconjugates and play an important role during development and regeneration, as they are involved as polysialic acid in a variety of cell-cell interactions mediated by the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM. The key enzyme for the biosynthesis of sialic acid is the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine-kinase (GNE). Mutations in the binding site of the feedback inhibitor CMP-sialic acid of the GNE leads to sialuria, a disease in which patients produce sialic acid in gram scale. Here, we report on the consequences after expression of a sialuria-mutated GNE. Expression of the sialuria-mutated GNE leads to a dramatic increase of both cellular sialic acid and polysialic acid on NCAM. This could also be achieved by application of the sialic acid precursor N-acetylmannosamine. Our data suggest that biosynthesis of sialic acid regulates and limits the synthesis of polysialic acid.

Effect of the increased stability of the penicillin amidase mRNA on the
protein expression levels.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 12;579(22):5069-73.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Several factors at transcriptional, post-transcriptional or post-translational level determine the fate of a target protein and can severely restrict its yield. Here, we focus on the post-transcriptional regulation of the biosynthesis of the periplasmic protein, penicillin amidase (PA). The PA mRNA stability was determined under depleted RNase conditions in strains carrying single or multiple RNase deletions. Single deletion of the endonuclease RNase E yielded, as the highest, a fourfold stabilization of the PA mRNA. This effect, however, was reduced twice at post-translational level. The RNase II, generating secondary exonucleolytic cleavages in the mRNA, although not significantly influencing the PA mRNA decay, led also to an increase of the amount of mature PA. The non-proportional correlation between increased mRNA longevity and amount of active enzyme propose that the rational strategies for yield improvement must be based on a simultaneous tuning of more than one yield restricting factor.

<ABSTRACT>
Fe-only hydrogenases contain a di-iron active site complex, in which the two Fe atoms have carbon monoxide and cyanide ligands and are linked together by a putative di(thiomethyl)amine molecule. We have cloned, purified and characterized the HydE and HydG proteins, thought to be involved in the biosynthesis of this peculiar metal site, from the thermophilic organism Thermotoga maritima. The HydE protein anaerobically reconstituted with iron and sulfide binds two [4Fe-4S] clusters, as characterized by UV and EPR spectroscopy. The HydG protein binds one [4Fe-4S] cluster, and probably an additional one. Both enzymes are able to reductively cleave S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) when reduced by dithionite, confirming that they are Radical-SAM enzymes.

Regulation of fatty acid uptake and metabolism in L6 skeletal muscle cells
by resistin.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 12;579(22):5049-54.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Resistin has been proposed as a potential link between obesity and insulin resistance. It is also well established that altered metabolism of fatty acids by skeletal muscle can lead to insulin resistance and lipotoxicity. However, little is known about the effect of resistin on long chain fatty acid uptake and metabolism in skeletal muscle. Here we show that treating rat skeletal muscle cells with recombinant resistin (50 nM, 24 h) decreased uptake of palmitate. This correlated with reduced cell surface CD36 content and lower expression of FATP1, but no change in FATP4 or CD36 expression. We also found that resistin decreased fatty acid oxidation by measuring 14CO2 production from [1-14C] oleate and an increase in intracellular lipid accumulation was detected in response to resistin. Decreased AMPK and ACC phosphorylation were observed in response to resistin while expression of ACC and AMPK isoforms was unaltered. Resistin mediated these effects without altering cell viability. In summary, our results demonstrate that chronic incubation of skeletal muscle cells with resistin decreased fatty acid uptake and metabolism via a mechanism involving decreased cell surface CD36 content, FATP1 expression and a decrease in phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC.

Functional identification of electrogenic Na+-translocating ATPase in the

FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 12;579(22):5002-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The hypothesis that the primary Na+-pump, Na+-ATPase, functions in the plasma membrane (PM) of halotolerant microalga Dunaliella maritima was tested using membrane preparations from this organism enriched with the PM vesicles. The pH profile of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the PM fractions exhibited a broad optimum between pH 6 and 9. Hydrolysis in the alkaline range was specifically stimulated by Na+ ions. Maximal sodium dependent ATP hydrolysis was observed at pH 7.5-8.0. On the assumption that the ATP-hydrolysis at alkaline pH values is related to a Na+-ATPase activity, we investigated two ATP-dependent processes, sodium uptake by the PM vesicles and generation of electric potential difference (Deltapsi) across the vesicle membrane. PM vesicles from D. maritima were found to be able to accumulate 22Na+ upon ATP addition, with an optimum at pH 7.5-8.0. The ATP-dependent Na+ accumulation was stimulated by the permeant NO3- anion and the protonophore CCCP, and inhibited by orthovanadate. The sodium accumulation was accompanied by pronounced Deltapsi generation across the vesicle membrane. The data obtained indicate that a primary Na+ pump, an electrogenic Na+-ATPase of the P-type, functions in the PM of marine microalga D. maritima.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Fluoxetine (Prozac) is a potent antidepressant compound inhibiting serotonin reuptake, but also Na+, K+ and Ca2+ channels and reported to both trigger and prevent apoptosis. Recently, fluoxetine was found to increase the voltage sensitivity of the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). VDAC which functions in transporting metabolites across the mitochondria also plays a crucial role in apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that fluoxetine interacted with VDAC and decreased its conductance. Fluoxetine inhibited the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, the release of cytochrome c, and protected against staurosporine-induced apoptotic cell death. These findings may explain some of the reported fluoxetine side effects.

<ABSTRACT>
Angiotensin II (Ang II) induces a prominent and sustained nitration and activation of ERK1/2 in rat vascular smooth muscle cells, both mediated via AT1 receptor. Nitration and activation was also shown for recombinant non-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and MEK. Nitration and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by Ang II was significantly inhibited by NAD(P)H inhibitors and scavengers of oxygen and nitrogen reactive species and completely blocked by a selective inducible nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor. MEK inhibitor U0126 did not affect ERK nitration but completely blocked activation. These data indicate that Ang II nitrates and activates ERK1/2 via a reactive species-sensitive pathway.

<ABSTRACT>
Erythrocyte glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD) is a glycolytic enzyme containing critical thiol groups and whose activity is reversibly inhibited by binding to the cell membrane. Here, we demonstrate that the insertion of ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FP) into the red cell membranes exerts two opposite effects on membrane bound G3PD. First, the enzyme is partially inactivated through oxidation of critical thiols. Dithiothreitol restores part of the activity, but some critical thiols are irreversibly oxidized or crosslinked to products of FP-induced lipid peroxidation. Second, G3PD binding to the membrane is modified and the enzyme is activated through displacement into the cytosol and/or release from its binding site.

Cannabinoids have been shown to inhibit the growth of a broad spectrum of tumour cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in that effect have not been completely elucidated. Here, we investigated the possible involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in CB2 receptor-induced apoptosis of human leukaemia cells. Results show that stimulation of the CB2 receptor leads to p38 MAPK activation and that inhibition of this kinase attenuates CB2 receptor-induced caspase activation and apoptosis. These findings support a role for p38 MAPK in CB2 receptor-induced apoptosis of human leukaemia cells.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
4-Hydroxynonenal (4HNE), generated during polyunsaturated fatty acid oxidation, is present in atherosclerotic lesions. As 4HNE is able to react with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), we investigated, using AC polarography, whether it may alter the physico-chemical state of a condensed PE-containing phospholipid monolayer and its interaction with apoA-I. The stability of a phospholipid monolayer relative to potential (around the potential of zero charge) is dependent on lipid composition (PE>PC>PE/PC). ApoA-I insertion into PE/PC monolayer is easier than in PC monolayer. Pre-treatment of PE/PC monolayer by 4HNE does not alter monolayer stability, but decreases apo A-I insertion into the monolayer.

<ABSTRACT>
Vimelysin is a metalloproteinase with high activity at low temperature and an unusual resistance to organic solvents. Substrate specificities of vimelysin and thermolysin were examined using FRETS-libraries, revealing a significant difference at the P3' position: vimelysin preferred acidic amino acid residues, whereas thermolysin preferred basic residues. Homology modeling of vimelysin suggests that oppositely charged residues in the S3' subsites (R215 in vimelysin and D213 in thermolysin) may be responsible for this specificity difference. This hypothesis was confirmed by examining the R215D mutant of vimelysin, which showed a substrate specificity profile intermediate between thermolysin and vimelysin.

Innexins are a family of transmembrane proteins involved in the formation of gap junctions, specific intercellular channels, in invertebrates. Analyses of the entire innexin family during Drosophila melanogaster embryonic development shows the occurrence of complex and specific patterns of expression of the different genes. Innexins inx-2 and inx-7, in general, do not appear to exhibit extensive co-expression in different D. melanogaster cellular compartments. We propose here a new and robust mechanism, based on our analysis of the genomic organization of inx-2 and inx-7, that structurally justifies the reciprocal expression of genes.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Adiponectin is thought to play a decisive role in the relationships among obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. This study investigated whether cardiomyocytes synthesize and secrete adiponectin, and the effects of this hormone on cardiac cells. RT-PCR showed that mouse, rat and human cardiomyocytes produced mRNA for adiponectin and adiponectin receptors 1 and 2. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of adiponectin in the cytoplasm of cultured cardiomyocytes, and radioimmunoassay showed that these cells secreted adiponectin into the culture medium. Exogenous adiponectin enhanced glucose and fatty acid uptake and induced AMPK phosphorylation in cultured cardiomyocytes. Our results demonstrate that adiponectin is synthesized and secreted by isolated murine and human cardiomyocytes, and suggest that the local production of this hormone by cardiomyocytes could be involved in the regulation of cardiac metabolism and function.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 26;579(23):5135-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Inflammatory stimuli provide critical activation signals for dendritic cells (DC). Signaling through the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 is reported to initiate DC maturation and migration. We attempted to characterize TRPV1 channels in DC. Capsaicin or extracellular protons failed to elicit a change in intracellular [Ca(2+)] or membrane current in DC. In contrast, capsaicin evoked a sustained increase in [Ca(2+)] and large inwards currents in sensory neurons and TRPV1-expressing HEK293 cells. TRPV1 expression was confirmed by RT-PCR in sensory neurons, but was undetectable in DC. Interestingly, and in contrast to capsaicin, the inflammatory neuropeptide substance P evoked Ca(2+) transients in DC. Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis that DC express TRPV1 channels. Rather, signaling through TRPV1 in sensory nerves may modulate DC via neurogenic actions.

<ABSTRACT>
The major secretory granule proteins chromogranins A (CGA) and B (CGB) have recently been shown to play critical roles in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent intracellular Ca(2+) mobilizations. We determined here the subcellular distribution of CGA and CGB based on 3D-images of chromaffin cells, and found that approximately 95% of cellular CGA was present in secretory granules while approximately 5% was in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas approximately 57% of cellular CGB was in secretory granules while approximately 24% and approximately 19% were in the ER and nucleus, respectively. These results suggest that chromogranins are at the center of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis in secretory cells.

<ABSTRACT>
It has been claimed that protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are scale-free, and that identifying high-degree "hub" proteins reveals important features of PPI networks. In this paper, we evaluate the claims that PPI node degree sequences follow a power law, a necessary condition for networks to be scale-free. We provide two PPI network examples which clearly do not have power laws when analyzed correctly, and thus at least these PPI networks are not scale-free. We also show that these PPI networks do appear to have power laws according to methods that have become standard in the existing literature. We explain the source of this error using numerically generated data from analytic formulas, where there are no sampling or noise ambiguities.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A microRNA (miRNA) is a 21-24 nucleotide RNA product of a non-protein-coding gene. Plants, like animals, have a large number of miRNA-encoding genes in their genomes. The biogenesis of miRNAs in Arabidopsis is similar to that in animals in that miRNAs are processed from primary precursors by at least two steps mediated by RNAse III-like enzymes and that the miRNAs are incorporated into a protein complex named RISC. However, the biogenesis of plant miRNAs consists of an additional step, i.e., the miRNAs are methylated on the ribose of the last nucleotide by the miRNA methyltransferase HEN1. The high degree of sequence complementarity between plant miRNAs and their target mRNAs has facilitated the bioinformatic prediction of miRNA targets, many of which have been subsequently validated. Plant miRNAs have been predicted or confirmed to regulate a variety of processes, such as development, metabolism, and stress responses. A large category of miRNA targets consists of genes encoding transcription factors that play important roles in patterning the plant form.

Effective removal of albumin from serum.

Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):3831-5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The protein constituents of serum can range from grams to picograms per liter, making it technically difficult to achieve in-depth proteomic analysis. Removal of highly abundant proteins, such as albumin, coupled to powerful protein separation methods is required for increased sample load, thus facilitating detection and identification of low-abundant proteins. We report here a chemical-based extraction method for the effective and specific removal of albumin from serum.

<ABSTRACT>
Direct injection of complex protein mixtures, e.g. those derived from crude biological fluids, is often incompatible with conventional LC supports, because of column clogging and rapid deterioration of chromatographic performance. In this paper, we report the use of restricted access media to rapidly enrich and fractionate human breast milk. This resin, combining size exclusion and anion exchange functionalities, yielded a fraction enriched in soluble CD14 and showing specific sCD14-dependant activity. This fraction was split into five aliquots, which were individually characterized using multidimensional protein identification technology. Reproducibility of the results was addressed by analysing and comparing five datasets using different protein identification tools available within the Sequest software. Furthermore, a comparison of three major releases of the Ensembl human protein database was performed to examine the effect of database updates on our results. We report here the benefit of repeated analysis of aliquots of the same fraction: first to increase the confidence in peptide identification by repeated confirmation in several aliquots; and second to assess experimental reproducibility. We demonstrate furthermore the effect of database modifications on the results and the importance of constantly re-analysing data with new releases to keep them consistent and up to date with the latest protein identities and predictions available.

Determination of the site-specific and isoform-specific glycosylation in
human plasma-derived antithrombin by IEF and capillary HPLC-ESI-MS/MS.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):4025-33.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The glycan structures of the major and more than ten minor populated isoforms of antithrombin (AT) were determined after separation of the isoforms by IEF using IPG strips. The bands excised from the gel were reduced, derivatized by iodoacetamide and submitted to tryptic digestion. The digest was analyzed by RP-HPLC-ESI-MS equipped with a quadrupole ion-trap mass analyzer. MS/MS experiments allowed establishing the monosaccharide compositions in the glycopeptides. For the major isoform of alpha-AT four identical biantennary glycans with two terminal sialic acids (SA) each, a total of eight SA, were found in full agreement with the literature. In the IEF-band containing this major isoform (pI 5.18) a further, much less abundant, isoform was detected showing a fucosylation on the glycan attached to Asn155 but being of otherwise identical structure as described above. The isoforms with pI 5.10 were found to include one triantennary glycan, all antennas carrying terminal SA. The occurrence of triantennary structure is site specific, involving the peptides with Asn(135) and Asn(155), alternately. At pI 5.24 we found those four isoforms that carry the glycans like the main-isoform of alpha-AT but missing one terminal SA. There was no site specificity found for the mono-sialo structure. The isoform at pI 5.31 is the major isoform of beta-AT containing three identical biantennary structures being fully sialylated. No isoforms (above 0.5% abundance) with two glycans only or three glycans other than beta-AT were detected. Fucosylation was found in the main isoform with an abundance of about 5%, and as expected with all the other isoforms with a comparable abundance.

Gene expression and protein profiling of AGS gastric epithelial cells upon
infection with Helicobacter pylori.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):3902-18.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Helicobacter pylori, one of the most common bacterial pathogens, colonizes the human stomach and causes a variety of gastric diseases. This pathogen elicits a range of phenotypic responses in infected cultured AGS gastric epithelial cells, including expression of proinflammatory genes and changes in the actin cytoskeleton. Some of these responses are mediated by the type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded by the cag pathogenicity island. We have used two global approaches, namely 2-DE combined with PMF and cDNA expression array analyses, to study in both a comprehensive and quantitative manner the protein profile and the temporal patterns of mRNA accumulation in AGS cells upon infection with H. pylori and isogenic T4SS mutants. We identified 140 transcripts and detected 190 protein species that were differentially regulated upon infection. Infection with wild-type H. pylori induced expression of a variety of host genes and changes in protein pattern involved in transcriptional responses, cell shape regulation and signal transduction. Among them, some were differentially regulated in a cag PAI-dependent manner, as shown by both the proteomic and cDNA expression array approaches. While 2-DE and PMF allowed us to examine the protein profiles in the infected host, array analysis enabled us to demonstrate dynamic temporal changes in host gene expression profile. In conclusion, our combined application of the two global approaches provides further molecular details on how the host cell responds to infection by H. pylori and its isogenic T4SS mutants on both transcriptional and protein levels. The findings pinpoint host proteins such as serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, transcription factors, cell cycle related components and actin cytoskeletal signaling molecules as potential targets of individual H. pylori virulence determinants. This study serves as a basis for future work on transcription and proteome analyses of the H. pylori infection model.

Identification of novel lysosomal matrix proteins by proteome analysis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):3966-78.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The lysosomal matrix is estimated to contain about 50 different proteins. Most of the matrix proteins are acid hydrolases that depend on mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPR) for targeting to lysosomes. Here, we describe a comprehensive proteome analysis of MPR-binding proteins from mouse. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts defective in both MPR (MPR 46-/- and MPR 300-/-) are known to secrete the lysosomal matrix proteins. Secretions of these cells were affinity purified using an affinity matrix derivatized with MPR46 and MPR300. In the protein fraction bound to the affinity matrix and eluted with mannose 6-phosphate, 34 known lysosomal matrix proteins, 4 candidate proteins of the lysosomal matrix and 4 non-lysosomal contaminants were identified by mass spectrometry after separation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or by multidimensional protein identification technology. For 3 of the candidate proteins, mammalian ependymin-related protein-2 (MERP-2), retinoid-inducible serine carboxypeptidase (RISC) and the hypothetical 66.3-kDa protein we could verify that C-terminally tagged forms bound in an M6P-dependent manner to an MPR-affinity matrix and were internalized via MPR-mediated endocytosis. Hence these 3 proteins are likely to represent hitherto unrecognized lysosomal matrix proteins.

Comparative proteomic analysis using samples obtained with laser
microdissection and saturation dye labelling.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):3851-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Comparative proteomic methods are rapidly being applied to many different biological systems including complex tissues. One pitfall of these methods is that in some cases, such as oncology and neuroscience, tissue complexity requires isolation of specific cell types and sample is limited. Laser microdissection (LMD) is commonly used for obtaining such samples for proteomic studies. We have combined LMD with sensitive thiol-reactive saturation dye labelling of protein samples and 2-D DIGE to identify protein changes in a test system, the isolated CA1 pyramidal neurone layer of a transgenic (Tg) rat carrying a human amyloid precursor protein transgene. Saturation dye labelling proved to be extremely sensitive with a spot map of over 5,000 proteins being readily produced from 5 mug total protein, with over 100 proteins being significantly altered at p < 0.0005. Of the proteins identified, all showed coherent changes associated with transgene expression. It was, however, difficult to identify significantly different proteins using PMF and MALDI-TOF on gels containing less than 500 mug total protein. The use of saturation dye labelling of limiting samples will therefore require the use of highly sensitive MS techniques to identify the significantly altered proteins isolated using methods such as LMD.

Comparative study of protein and mRNA expression during
osteoclastogenesis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):3868-75.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Osteoclasts, the bone-digesting cells, are key players in bone remodeling. To identify proteins potentially involved in osteoclast function, we analyzed the patterns of protein expression during osteoclastogenesis by2-D DIGE. As a model system we used the mouse myeloid Raw 264.7 cell line that differentiates in vitro into osteoclasts upon treatment with specific growth factors. In 2-D DIGE, we identified 86 up- and 34 down-regulated proteins including known osteoclast differentiation markers as well as proteins regulating key cellular functions of osteoclasts such as energy production, cytoskeleton dynamics, and digestion of organic and inorganic bone matrix. Comparison of protein expression using 2-D DIGE techniques with mRNA expression analyzed by DNA microarrays revealed essentially two groups of genes. The first group comprises genes for which differences in both mRNA and protein expressions were found. A second group covers genes whose expression was not altered at the mRNA level but whose corresponding gene products exhibited different electrophoretic mobilities, thereby revealing potential changes in post-transcriptional processing and PTM. Thus, these combined approaches identify new potential therapeutic targets for treatment of bone diseases and provide complementary information on regulatory processes that might affect osteoclastogenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
We have previously described our strategy for high-throughput (HT) production of recombinant antigens for anti-mKIAA antibody generation, which involves using shotgun fragments generated during entire sequencing of mKIAA cDNAs. We applied this strategy to 1628 mouse KIAA (mKIAA) cDNA fragments, and 84.2% of the GST-mKIAA fusion proteins were successfully purified. The solubility of the proteins was predicted by a small-scale bacterial culture, and a large-scale culture was then performed according to the expected results. Among them, 43.8% of the proteins were purified as a soluble form and 56.2% as an insoluble form. The average yield of the soluble proteins was 0.15 nmol/mL of bacterial culture, and that of the insoluble proteins was 0.55 nmol/mL Statistical analysis of the data revealed a significant correlation between amino acid features of the recombinant proteins and their solubility. To achieve the most effective and feasible protein expression, we constructed a decision tree in which the analyzed data were reflected. The information described here may provide practical guidelines for HT production of recombinant proteins.

Fatty acid synthesis is a target for antibacterial activity of unsaturated
fatty acids.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 26;579(23):5157-62.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid, show antibacterial activity and are the key ingredients of antimicrobial food additives and some antibacterial herbs. However, the precise mechanism for this antimicrobial activity remains unclear. We found that linoleic acid inhibited bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI), an essential component of bacterial fatty acid synthesis, which has served as a promising target for antibacterial drugs. Additional unsaturated fatty acids including palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid also exhibited the inhibition of FabI. However, neither the saturated form (stearic acid) nor the methyl ester of linoleic acid inhibited FabI. These FabI-inhibitory activities of various fatty acids and their derivatives very well correlated with the inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis using [(14)C] acetate incorporation assay, and importantly, also correlated with antibacterial activity. Furthermore, the supplementation with exogenous fatty acids reversed the antibacterial effect of linoleic acid, which showing that it target fatty acid synthesis. Our data demonstrate for the first time that the antibacterial action of unsaturated fatty acids is mediated by the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis.

shape and septation in fission yeast.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 26;579(23):5181-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The small GTPase Rho1 plays an essential role in controlling the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and synthesis of the cell wall in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here we studied the role of Rho5 whose primary structure is very similar to that of Rho1. It was found that elevated expression of Rho5 was able to compensate for the lethality of cells lacking Rho1. Rho5 was localized to the ends of interphase cells and the mid-region of mitotic cells. Overexpression of Rho5 caused depolarization of F-actin patches and abnormal formation of the cell wall, as did Rho1. Although rho5(+) was not essential for maintaining the cell shape, rho1 rho5-double null cells showed more severe defects in cell viability than rho1-null cells. Thus, it is likely that Rho5 has an overlapping function with Rho1 in controlling cell growth and division in S. pombe.

<ABSTRACT>
We compared the transcriptional activities of the circular and linear forms of short (4kbp) and giant (106kbp) DNA molecules in the presence of a polyamine, spermine (4+). With an increase in the spermine concentration, transcriptional activity was enhanced, followed by an inhibitory effect, and complete inhibition was observed in the sole case of long, linear templates. A difference between the transcriptional properties of circular and linear conformations is found for giant DNA molecules. These results are discussed in relation to DNA conformational transitions.

The lack of a membrane environment in membrane protein crystals is considered one of the major limiting factors to fully imply X-ray structural data to explain functional properties of ion channels [Gulbis, J.M. and Doyle, D. (2004) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 14, 440-446]. Here, we provide infrared spectroscopic evidence that the structure and stability of the potassium channel KcsA and its chymotryptic derivative 1-125 KcsA reconstituted into native-like membranes differ from those exhibited by these proteins in detergent solution, the latter taken as an approximation of the mixed detergent-protein crystal conditions.

<ABSTRACT>
Reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers of a poly-3-hydroxybutyrate/calcium/polyphosphate (PHB/Ca(2+)/polyP) complex from Escherichia coli membranes yields cationic-selective, 100 pS channels (Das, S., Lengweiler, U.D., Seebach, D. and Reusch, R.N.

USA 94, 9075-9079). Here, we report that this complex can also form larger, weakly selective pores, with a maximal conductance ranging from 250pS to 1nS in different experiments (symmetric 150mM KCl). Single channels were inhibited by lanthanum (IC(50)=42+/-4microM, means+/-S.E.M.) with an unusually high Hill coefficient (8.4+/-1.2). Transition to low-conductance states (<250pS) was favored by increased membrane polarization (/V/ >or=50mV). High conductance states (>250pS) may reflect conformations important for genetic transformability, or "competence", of the bacterial cells, which requires the presence of the PHB/Ca(2+)/polyP complex in the membrane.

<ABSTRACT>
The reactions of Dopa decarboxylase (DDC) with l- and d-enantiomers of tryptophan methyl ester are described. Although both the enantiomers bind to the active site of the enzyme with similar affinity, their binding modes are different. l-enantiomer binds in an unproductive mode, while d-enantiomer acts as an oxidative deamination substrate. For the first time a quinonoid has been detected as intermediate of this reaction. By using rapid-scanning stopped-flow kinetic technique rate constants for formation and decay of this species have been determined. All these data, besides validating the functional DDC active site model, represent an important step toward the elucidation of the catalytic pathway of oxidative deamination.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In a search for the physiological conditions able to suppress the disruption of electron transport through the inner mitochondrial membrane induced by Bax, we found that respiratory substrate - lactate completely abolished Bax toxicity in yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. The effect of lactate was dependent on the presence of cytochrome c, as no effect was observed in the cytochrome c null strain. The investigation of lactate effect on markers of Bax toxicity showed that: (i) oxidation of lactate did not affect the decrease in oxygen consumption, but (ii) lactate was able to diminish the generation of reactive oxygen species and simultaneously to suppress Bax-induced cell death. We show that suppression of Bax lethality in K. lactis can be, in addition to anti-apoptotic proteins, achieved also by the utilization of lactate in the mitochondria.

Proteomic analysis of proteins expressed by Helicobacter pylori under

Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):3895-901.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Helicobacter pylori is a spiral, slow growing gram-negative microaerophilic bacterium. It has been shown to be the etiological agent of gastroduodenal diseases, such as chronic gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers, and gastric cancer. To address the influence of oxidative stress and its underlying mechanisms, we have compared proliferation, urease activity and protein expression profile of H. pylori incubated under normal microaerophilic (5% O2) and aerobic stress (20% O2) conditions. Oxidative-stress cells displayed coccoid morphology and time-dependent decrease in proliferation. The urease activity was completely abrogated after 32 h. We have further compared the protein expression profiles of H. pylori under normal growing and oxidative-stress conditions by a global proteomic analysis, which includes high-resolution 2-DE followed by MALDI-TOF-MS and bioinformatic databases search/peptide-mass comparison. The results revealed that more than ten proteins were differentially expressed under oxidative stress. Most notably, the protein expression levels of urease accessory protein E (UreE, an essential metallochaperone for urease activity) and alkylhydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) with antioxidant potential are greatly decreased under stress conditions. Measurements of messenger RNA transcription level by performing RT-PCR on total mRNA also confirmed that gene expressions for these two proteins are consistently repressed under oxygen tension. These changes form a firm basis to account for the loss of urease activity and anti-oxidative ability of H. pylori after long-term exposure to reactive oxygen. Conceivably, UreE and AhpC may thus be listed as potential targets for the development of therapeutic drugs against H. pylori.

Proteomic analysis of rice embryo: an approach for investigating Galpha
protein-regulated proteins.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):3932-41.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The rice dwarf1 (d1) mutant, which lacks the alpha subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein (Galpha protein), shows abnormal morphology due to shortened internodes, dark green leaves and grains that are small and round. Proteome analysis was used in this study to aid in determining the function of Galpha protein in rice embryos. Using 2-DE, seven seed embryo proteins were shown to be down-regulated in the d1 mutant as compared with its wild type. These seven proteins included a receptor for activated C-kinase (RACK) and six rice embryo globulin-2 proteins (REG2). The six REG2 have similar molecular masses with minor differences in pI. In addition to the reduced accumulation of RACK in the d1 mutant, the increase in QL/d1, in which a constitutively active form of the Galpha protein is expressed, was significantly higher as compared with wild type. The level of accumulation of these seven proteins during seed development and maturation did not change significantly until the 2nd wk after pollination. Reduced accumulation of these seven proteins started in the d1 mutant at the 3rd wk after pollination, and continued until seed maturation was complete. All seven proteins were completely absent 24 h after imbibition in both d1 mutant and its wild type. However, the phytohormone abscisic acid promoted the expression level of RACK after imbibition in the wild type as compared with d1 mutant. These results suggest that RACK is regulated by Galpha-protein and plays an important role in a basic cellular process as well as in rice embryogenesis and germination.

Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):4034-45.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We describe methods for broad characterization of the human plasma proteome. The combination of stepwise immunoglobulin G (IgG) and albumin protein depletion by affinity chromatography and ultrahigh-efficiency capillary liquid chromatography separations coupled to ion trap-tandem mass spectrometry enabled identification of 2392 proteins from a single plasma sample with an estimated confidence level of > 94%, and an additional 2198 proteins with an estimated confidence level of 80%. The relative abundances of the identified proteins span a range of over eight orders of magnitude in concentration (< 30 pg/mL to approximately 30 mg/mL), facilitated by the attomole-level sensitivity of the analysis methods. More than 80% of the observed proteins demonstrate interactions with IgG and/or albumin, and the human plasma protein loss in the affinity chromatography/strong cation exchange/reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methodology was investigated in detail. The results of this study provide a basis for a wide range of plasma proteomics studies, including broad quantitation of relative abundances in comparative studies of the identification of novel protein disease markers, as well as further studies of protein-protein interactions.

Plasma membrane-focused proteomics: dramatic changes in surface expression
during the maturation of human dendritic cells.

Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):4001-11.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The differential expression of surface molecules on dendritic cells (DC) reflects their functional differences as immature and mature subsets. It is difficult, however, to characterize differences in surface expression by standard proteomic approaches, due mainly to the hydrophobic nature and low abundance of the individual proteins in question. We have established a method for obtaining high-yield plasmalemma preparations which contain surface molecules enriched more than 200-fold by coating cells with beads conjugated with antibody against a cell type-specific cell-surface molecule, followed by nitrogen cavitated disruption, magnetic separation, and density gradient ultracentrifugation. We identified and quantified 339 human monocyte-derived DC transmembrane proteins, including 33 previously uncharacterized molecules. Whereas 106 proteins were selectively expressed in immature cells or down-regulated after maturation, 191 proteins were selectively expressed in mature cells or up-regulated after maturation.

Wheat cultivar-specific proteins in grain revealed by 2-DE and their
application to cultivar identification of flour.

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):3942-53.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Wheat flour proteins were studied to identify the cultivar-specific proteins and use them to identify cultivars in flours. Proteins extracted from flours of Japanese wheat (cultivars Hokushin, Horoshirikomugi, Kitanokaori and Kachikei 33) and Canadian wheat (Canada Western Red Spring Wheat No. 1; 1CW) were analyzed by 2-DE with IEF gels over three pH ranges: pH 4-7, pH 5-8, and pH 6-11. This system enabled detection of more than 1600 protein spots. We recognized that among 50 protein spots showing cultivar-dependent qualitative changes, 25 proteins were wheat cultivar specific. These 50 protein spots were analyzed by N-terminal Edman degradation microsequencing and MALDI-TOF-MS; 21 protein spots were storage proteins, such as gliadin and low-molecular mass glutenin subunit. Five protein spots were identified as dehydroascorbate reductase (Triticum aestivum), triticin precursor (T. aestivum), alpha-amylase inhibitor (Oryza sativa), DNA-binding with one finger (Dof) zinc family protein (O. sativa), and nonphototropic hypocotyl 1 (NPH1) protein (Avena sativa). The other protein spots appeared to be hypothetical proteins (O. sativa or Arabidopsis thaliana) or functional unknown proteins. These specific proteins can be used as markers to identify wheat cultivars in blended flour composed of two or three flours.

<ABSTRACT>
Progress is being made in the development of RNA interference-based (RNAi-based) strategies for the control of gene expression. It has been demonstrated that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can silence the expression of target genes in a sequence-specific manner in mammalian cells. Various groups, including our own, have developed systems for vector-mediated specific RNAi. Vector-based siRNA- (or shRNA) expression libraries directed against the entire human genome and siRNA libraries based on chemically synthesized oligonucleotides now allow the rapid identification of functional genes and potential drug targets. Use of such libraries will enhance our understanding of numerous biological phenomena and contribute to the rational design of drugs against heritable, infectious and malignant diseases.

<ABSTRACT>
Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a potent trigger of sequence-specific gene silencing mechanisms known as RNA silencing or RNA interference. The recognition of the target sequences is mediated by ribonucleoprotein complexes that contain 21- to 28-nucleotide (nt) guide RNAs derived from processing of the trigger dsRNA. Here, we review the experimental and bioinformatic approaches that were used to identify and characterize these small RNAs isolated from cells and tissues. The identification and characterization of small RNAs and their expression patterns is important for elucidating gene regulatory networks.

Incorporation of oxygen into the succinate co-product of iron(II) and

<ABSTRACT>
The ferrous iron and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent oxygenases catalyse two electron oxidation reactions by coupling the oxidation of substrate to the oxidative decarboxylation of 2OG, giving succinate and carbon dioxide coproducts. The evidence available on the level of incorporation of one atom from dioxygen into succinate is inconclusive. Here, we demonstrate that five members of the 2OG oxygenase family, AlkB from Escherichia coli, anthocyanidin synthase and flavonol synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana, and prolyl hydroxylase domain enzyme 2 and factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1 from Homo sapiens all incorporate a single oxygen atom, almost exclusively derived from dioxygen, into the succinate co-product.

<ABSTRACT>
Sterol-enriched lipid rafts have been involved in Drosophila membrane signalling such as Hedgehog targeting and glutamate receptor ligand-affinity regulation. Here, we show that the voltage-dependent K(+) currents expressed by the intrinsic neurons of the Mushroom bodies are upward-modulated by compounds that remove sterols from the plasma membrane. Modulation seems to rely on a fast-exchanging sterol-pool, which more strongly affects the slowly inactivating current. Our results provide the first evidence that sterols influence the operation of voltage-gated ion channels in Drosophila neurons and strengthen the importance of lipid rafts in this biological model.

<ABSTRACT>
RNA silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) refers to the small RNA-guided gene silencing mechanism conserved in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms from plants to mammals. As part of this special issue on the biology, mechanisms and applications of RNAi, here we review the recent advances on defining a role of RNAi in the responses of invertebrate and vertebrate animals to virus infection. Approximately 40 miRNAs and 10 RNAi suppressors encoded by diverse mammalian viruses have been identified. Assays used for the identification of viral suppressors and possible biological functions of both viral miRNAs and suppressors are discussed. We propose that herpes viral miRNAs may act as specificity factors to initiate heterochromatin assembly of the latent viral DNA genome in the nucleus.

<ABSTRACT>
In plants, the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery responds to a variety of triggers including viral infection, transgenes, repeated elements and transposons. All of these triggers lead to silencing outcomes ranging from mRNA degradation to translational repression to chromatin remodeling. Thus, plants offer us a potentially unique opportunity to understand the full range of RNAi effector mechanisms. In this review, we discuss the recent developments in our understanding of plant RNAi mechanisms from a biochemical perspective.

Regulation of the F0F1-ATP synthase: the conformation of subunit epsilon
might be determined by directionality of subunit gamma rotation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 26;579(23):5114-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
F(0)F(1)-ATP synthase couples ATP synthesis/hydrolysis with transmembrane proton transport. The catalytic mechanism involves rotation of the gamma epsilon c(approximately 10)-subunits complex relative to the rest of the enzyme. In the absence of protonmotive force the enzyme is inactivated by the tight binding of MgADP. Subunit epsilon also modulates the activity: its conformation can change from a contracted to extended form with C-terminus stretched towards F(1). The latter form inhibits ATP hydrolysis (but not synthesis). We propose that the directionality of the coiled-coil subunit gamma rotation determines whether subunit epsilon is in contracted or extended form. Block of rotation by MgADP presumably induces the extended conformation of subunit epsilon. This conformation might serve as a safety lock, stabilizing the ADP-inhibited state upon de-energization and preventing spontaneous re-activation and wasteful ATP hydrolysis. The hypothesis merges the known regulatory effects of ADP, protonmotive force and conformational changes of subunit epsilon into a consistent picture.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
DNA methylation is important for stable transcriptional gene silencing. DNA methyltransferases for de novo as well as maintenance methylation have been well characterized. However, enzymes responsible for active DNA demethylation have been elusive and several reported mechanisms of active demethylation have been controversial. There has been a critical need for genetic analysis in order to firmly establish an in vivo role for putative DNA demethylases. Mutations in the bifunctional DNA glycosylase/lyase ROS1 in Arabidopsis cause DNA hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of specific genes. Recombinant ROS1 protein has DNA glycosylase/lyase activity on methylated but not unmethylated DNA substrates. Therefore, there is now strong genetic evidence supporting a base excision repair mechanism for active DNA demethylation. DNA demethylases may be critical factors for genome wide hypomethylation seen in cancers and possibly important for epigenetic reprogramming during somatic cell cloning and stem cell function.

<ABSTRACT>
RNA interference (RNAi) is a form of gene silencing induced by double stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is processed into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). RNAi can induce both post-transcriptional and transcriptional gene silencing. In Caenorhabditis elegans, there are several distinct pathways where post-transcriptional or/and transcriptional RNAi mechanisms are involved. RNAi in C. elegans is also systemic and heritable. This review will discuss RNAi related pathways, features of RNAi in C. elegans and possibilities of endogenous gene regulation by RNAi.

<ABSTRACT>
RNA silencing as a robust host defense mechanism against plant viruses is generally countered by virus-encoded silencing suppressors. This strategy is now increasingly recognized to be used by animal viruses as well. We present here an overview of the common features shared by some of the better studied plant viral silencing suppressors. We then briefly describe the characteristics of the few reported animal viral suppressors, notably their extraordinary ability of cross-kingdom suppression. We next discuss the basis for biased protection of viral RNA and subviral parasites by silencing suppressors, the link between movement and silencing suppression, the influence of temperature on the outcome of viral infection and the effect of viral silencing suppressors on the microRNA pathway.

The hydrophobic amino acid residues in the membrane-proximal C tail of the
G protein-coupled vasopressin V2 receptor are necessary for
transport-competent receptor folding.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 26;579(23):5227-35.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
It is believed that the membrane-proximal C tail of the G protein-coupled receptors forms an additional alpha helix with amphipathic properties (helix 8). It was previously shown for the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) that a conserved dileucine motif (L(339), L(340)) in this putative helix 8 is necessary for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transfer of the receptor. Here, we demonstrate that the other hydrophobic residues forming the non-polar side of this helix (F(328), V(332) and L(336)) are also transport-relevant. In contrast, the multiple serine residues contributing to the more hydrophilic side (S(330), S(331), S(333), S(334), S(338)) do not influence receptor trafficking. In addition, we show unambiguously by the use of pharmacological chaperones that the hydrophobic residues of the putative helix 8 do not form a transport signal necessary for receptor sorting into ER to Golgi vesicles. Instead, they are necessary to establish a transport-competent folding state in the early secretory pathway.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The uptake of different cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) in two yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, was studied using fluorescence HPLC-analyses of cell content. Comparison of the ability of penetratin, pVEC and (KFF)(3)K to traverse the yeast cell envelope shows that the cellular uptake of the peptides varies widely. Moreover, the intracellular degradation of the CPPs studied varies from complete stability to complete degradation. We show that intracellular degradation into membrane impermeable products can significantly contribute to the fluorescence signal. pVEC displayed highest internalizing capacity, and considering its stability in both yeast species, it is an attractive candidate for further studies.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Hepatitis B virus core protein self-assembles into icosahedral, highly immunogenic capsid-like particles (CLPs) that can serve as molecular platforms for heterologous proteins. Insertion into the centrally located c/e1 epitope leads to surface display, fusion to the C terminus to internal disposition of the foreign domains. However, symmetry-defined space restrictions on the surface and particularly inside the CLPs limit the size of usable heterologous fusion partners. Further, CLPs carrying differing foreign domains are desirable for applications such as multivalent vaccines, and for structure probing by distance sensitive interactions like fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Here, we report an in vitro co-assembly system for such mosaic-CLPs allowing successful CLP formation with a per se assembly-deficient fusion protein, and of CLPs from two different fluoroprotein-carrying fusions that exert FRET in an assembly-status dependent way.

<ABSTRACT>
Tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) results from point mutations in the extracellular domain of TNF receptor 1 (TNFRSF1A), but the effects of the mutations are controversial. This study shows that reduced NF-kappaB signalling is a feature of four TRAPS mutations. Reduced signalling correlates with reduced surface expression, measured by flow cytometry and microscopy. This suggests that correct formation of the extracellular domain of TNFRSF1A is important for localisation and receptor function. Importantly, our data provides a mechanism for the reduced TNFRSF1 signalling observed in a patient cell line.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Ion-channel activity of a series of gramicidin A analogues carrying charged amino-acid sequences on the C-terminus of the peptide was studied on planar bilayer lipid membranes and liposomes. It was found that the analogue with the positively charged sequence GSGRRRRSQS forms classical cationic pores at low concentrations and large unselective pores at high concentrations. The peptide was predominantly in the right-handed beta(6.3)-helical conformation in liposomes as shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The single-channel conductance of the large pore was estimated to be 320pS in 100mM choline chloride as judged from the fluctuation analysis of the multi-channel current. The analogue with the negatively charged sequence GSGEEEESQS exhibited solely classical cationic channel activity. The ability of a peptide to form different type of channels can be used in the search for broad-spectrum antibiotics.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Synaptotagmins (Syts) are involved in Ca(2+)-dependent insulin release. However, which Syt isoform is functional in primary beta-cells remains unknown. We demonstrate by electron microscopy of pancreatic islets, the association of Syt 9 with insulin granules. Silencing of Syt 9 by RNA interference adenovirus in islet cells had no effect on the expression of Syt 5, Syt 7 and Syt 3 isoforms. The latter was localized at the plasma membrane of pancreatic polypeptide cells. Insulin release in response to glucose or tolbutamide was strongly inhibited in Syt 9 deficient islets, whereas exocytosis potentiated by raising cAMP levels, was unaltered. Thus, Syt 9 may act as Ca(2+) sensor for beta-cell secretion.

Role of conserved cysteines in mediating sulfur transfer from IscS to

FEBS Lett. 2005 Sep 26;579(23):5236-40.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The role of the three conserved cysteine residues on Azotobacter vinelandii IscU in accepting sulfane sulfur and forming a covalent complex with IscS has been evaluated using electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry studies of variants involving individual cysteine-to-alanine substitutions. The results reveal that IscS can transfer sulfur to each of the three alanine-substituted forms of IscU to yield persulfide or polysulfide species, and formation of a heterodisulfide covalent complex between IscS and Cys(37) on IscU. It is concluded that S transfer from IscS to IscU does not involve a specific cysteine on IscU or the formation of an IscS-IscU heterodisulfide complex.

<ABSTRACT>
Kinetics of copper uptake in both oxidation states by the folded and unfolded forms of the type 1 copper protein rusticyanin have been studied. The speed of the binding of copper(I) to the folded rusticyanin is fast, and of the same order of magnitude as copper(I) uptake by the unfolded form. Thus, the binding of copper can be subsequent to the protein folding, contrary to previous proposals. Implications for the mechanism of the formation of the active holoprotein in vivo are discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
Usage of guanine and cytosine at three codon sites in eubacterial genes vary distinctly with potential expressivity, as predicted by Codon Adaptation Index (CAI). In bacteria with moderate/high GC-content, G(3) follows a biphasic relationship, while C(3) increases with CAI. In AT-rich bacteria, correlation of CAI is negative with G(3), but non-specific with C(3). Correlations of CAI with residues encoded by G-starting codons are positive, while with those by C-starting codons are usually negative/random. Average Size/Complexity Score and aromaticity of gene-products decrease with CAI, confirming general validity of cost-minimization principle in free-living eubacteria. Alcoholicity of bacterial gene-products usually decreases with expressivity.

Proteomics. 2005 Sep;5(14):3696-711.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus anthracis are closely related species that share a similar genetic background but occupy different ecological niches. Virulence plasmids bearing genes coding for toxins, may explain, at least partly, this specialization. We have compared by 2-DE in the early stationary phase of growth the extracellular proteomes of three strains of these species that have lost their virulence plasmids. Proteins expected to be secreted or to belong to the cell wall or to the cytosol were found in the three proteomes. For the cell wall and cytosolic proteins located in the extracellular space, the three proteomes were similar. Cytosolic proteins included enolase, GroEL, PdhB, PdhD, SodA and others. Cell surface proteins were mainly autolysins, proteases, nucleotidases and OppAs. In contrast, the secreted proteins profiles of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis were quite different from that of B. anthracis. B. cereus and B. thuringiensis extracellular proteomes both contained large amounts of secreted degradative enzymes and toxins, including nine proteases, three phospholipases, two haemolysins and several enterotoxins. Most of the genes encoding these enzymes and toxins are controlled by the transcriptional activator PlcR. The extracellular proteome of the pXO1-, pXO2- B. anthracis 9131 strain contained only one secreted protein: the metalloprotease InhA1, also found in the proteomes of the two other strains and possibly involved in antibacterial peptide degradation.

<ABSTRACT>
The spring workshop of the HUPO-PSI convened in Siena to further progress the data standards which are already making an impact on data exchange and deposition in the field of proteomics. Separate work groups pushed forward existing XML standards for the exchange of Molecular Interaction data (PSI-MI, MIF) and Mass Spectrometry data (PSI-MS, mzData) whilst significant progress was made on PSI-MS' mzIdent, which will allow the capture of data from analytical tools such as peak list search engines. A new focus for PSI (GPS, gel electrophoresis) was explored; as was the need for a common representation of protein modifications by all workers in the field of proteomics and beyond. All these efforts are contextualised by the work of the General Proteomics Standards workgroup; which in addition to the MIAPE reporting guidelines, is continually evolving an object model (PSI-OM) from which will be derived the general standard XML format for exchanging data between researchers, and for submission to repositories or journals.

<ABSTRACT>
Liver X receptors (LXRs) alpha and beta share considerable sequence homology and several functions, respond to the same endogenous and synthetic ligands, and play critical roles in maintaining lipid homeostasis. In this study, liverwort-derived riccardin C (RC) and F (RF) were identified as an LXRalpha agonist/LXRbeta antagonist and an LXRalpha antagonist, respectively. RC and RF bound to LXRs, but had different abilities to recruit a coactivator and thereby induce transactivation. Despite its unique subtype-selective activity, RC enhanced ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression and cellular cholesterol efflux in THP-1 cells. RC may provide a novel tool for identifying subtype-function and drug development.

<ABSTRACT>
Direct comparisons of human (h) and murine (m) neutrophil elastase (NE) and proteinase 3 (PR3) are important for the understanding and interpretation of inflammatory and PR3-related autoimmune processes investigated in wild-type-, mNE- and mPR3/mNE knockout mice. To this end, we purified recombinant mPR3 and mNE expressed in HMC1 and 293 cells and compared their biophysical properties, proteolytic activities and susceptibility to inhibitors with those of their human homologues, hPR3 and hNE. Significant species differences in physico-chemical properties, substrate specificities and enzyme kinetics towards synthetic peptide substrates, oxidized insulin B chain, and fibrinogen were detected. MeOSuc-AAPV-pNA and Suc-AAPV-pNA were hydrolyzed more efficiently by mPR3 than hPR3, but enzymatic activities of mNE and hNE were very similar. Fibrinogen was cleaved much more efficiently by mPR3 than by hPR3. All four proteases were inhibited by alpha(1)-antitrypsin and elafin. Eglin C inihibited mNE, hNE, mPR3, but not hPR3. SLPI inhibited both NEs, but neither PR3. The custom-designed hNE inhibitor, Val(15)-aprotinin, is a poor inhibitor for mNE. In conclusion, appropriate interpretation of experiments in murine models requires individual species-specific assessment of neutrophil protease function and inhibition.

The verprolin family of proteins, WIP, CR16 and WIRE/WICH, has emerged as critical regulators of cytoskeletal organisation in vertebrate cells. The founding father of the family, verprolin, was originally identified in budding yeast and later shown to be needed for actin polymerisation during polarised growth and during endocytosis. The vertebrate verprolins regulate actin dynamics either by binding directly to actin, by binding the WASP family of proteins or by binding to other actin regulating proteins. Interestingly, also the vertebrate verprolins have been implicated in endocytosis, demonstrating that most of the functional modules in this fascinating group of proteins have been conserved from yeast to man.

Structural determinants of unexpected agonist activity in a retro-peptide

<ABSTRACT>
We have synthesised two retro-peptide analogues of the stromal cell derived growth factor 1 (SDF-1alpha) segment known to be critical for CXCR4 receptor binding, corresponding to the sequences HSEFFRCPCRFFESH and HSEFFRGGGRFFESH. We have assayed the ability of these peptides to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation in cells over expressing the SDF-1alpha receptor, finding that the first variant was able to serve as an agonist of CXCR4, whereas the second one was inactive. Finally, by comparing representative solution structures of the two peptides, we have found that the biological response of HSEFFRCPCRFFESH may be ascribed to a beta-beta-type turn motif centred on Phe(4)-Phe(5).

A systems biology approach to genetic studies of complex diseases.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 10;579(24):5325-32.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Revealing mechanisms underlying complex diseases poses great challenges to biologists. The traditional linkage and linkage disequilibrium analysis that have been successful in the identification of genes responsible for Mendelian traits, however, have not led to similar success in discovering genes influencing the development of complex diseases. Emerging functional genomic and proteomic ('omic') resources and technologies provide great opportunities to develop new methods for systematic identification of genes underlying complex diseases. In this report, we propose a systems biology approach, which integrates omic data, to find genes responsible for complex diseases. This approach consists of five steps: (1) generate a set of candidate genes using gene-gene interaction data sets; (2) reconstruct a genetic network with the set of candidate genes from gene expression data; (3) identify differentially regulated genes between normal and abnormal samples in the network; (4) validate regulatory relationship between the genes in the network by perturbing the network using RNAi and monitoring the response using RT-PCR; and (5) genotype the differentially regulated genes and test their association with the diseases by direct association studies. To prove the concept in principle, the proposed approach is applied to genetic studies of the autoimmune disease scleroderma or systemic sclerosis.

Palindromic repetitive DNA elements with coding potential in
Methanocaldococcus jannaschii.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 10;579(24):5281-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have identified 141 novel palindromic repetitive elements in the genome of euryarchaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. The total length of these elements is 14.3kb, which corresponds to 0.9% of the total genomic sequence and 6.3% of all extragenic regions. The elements can be divided into three groups (MJRE1-3) based on the sequence similarity. The low sequence identity within each of the groups suggests rather old origin of these elements in M. jannaschii. Three MJRE2 elements were located within the protein coding regions without disrupting the coding potential of the host genes, indicating that insertion of repeats might be a widespread mechanism to enhance sequence diversity in coding regions.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 10;579(24):5353-60.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The recently described pneumococcal histidine triad protein family has been shown to be highly conserved within the pneumococcus. As part of our structural genomics effort on proteins from Streptococcus pneumoniae, we have expressed, crystallised and solved the structure of PhtA-166-220 at 1.2 Angstroms using remote SAD with zinc. The structure of PhtA-166-220 shows no similarity to any protein structure. The overall fold contains 3beta-strands and a single short alpha-helix. The structure appears to contain a novel zinc binding motif. The remaining 4 histidine triad repeats from PhtA have been modelled based on the crystal structure of the PhtA histidine triad repeat 2. From this modelling work, we speculate that only three of the five histidine triad repeats contain the residues in the correct geometry to allow the binding of a zinc ion.

Leishmania major thialysine Nepsilon-acetyltransferase: identification of
amino acid residues crucial for substrate binding.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 10;579(24):5347-52.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Thialysine N(epsilon)-acetyltransferases and spermidine/spermine N-acetyltransferases (SSAT) are closely related members of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily. Accordingly, a putative orthologue from the human protozoan parasite Leishmania major exhibits an almost equal similarity to human SSAT and thialysine N(epsilon)-acetyltransferase. Characterisation of the recombinantly expressed L. major protein indicated that it represents a thialysine N(epsilon)-acetyltransferase, preferring thialysine (S-aminoethyl-l-cysteine) and structurally related amino acids as acceptor molecules. The known thialysine N(epsilon)-acetyltransferases contain five conserved amino acid residues that are replaced in SSAT sequences. Kinetic analyses of the respective recombinant mutant proteins suggest that Ser(82) and Thr(83) of L. major thialysine N(epsilon)-acetyltransferase are key residues for acceptor binding. In addition, the conserved Leu(130) is tentatively involved in specific interaction with the sulphur-containing side chain of thialysine. The presence of these three amino acid residues is suggested to be a means by which thialysine N(epsilon)-acetyltransferases can be distinguished from SSAT sequences.

<ABSTRACT>
Quercetin is a major flavonoid in plant foods and potentially has beneficial effects on disease prevention. The present work demonstrated that quercetin was transported into the lymph after being metabolized in the gastrointestinal mucosa of rats. Glucuronide/sulfate and methylated conjugates of quercetin appeared in the lymph, but not quercetin aglycone. The highest lymphatic concentration was found at as rapid as 30 min after administration, suggesting gastric absorption, whereas the mucosal glucuronidation activity was significantly higher in the duodenum and jejunum than in the stomach. This is the first report to show the lymphatic flavonoid transport pathway from the gastrointestinal tract.

Endothelial progenitor cell sprouting in spheroid cultures is resistant to

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 10;579(24):5338-42.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Survival of tissue transplants generated in vitro is strongly limited by the slow process of graft vascularization in vivo. A method to enhance graft vascularization is to establish a primitive vascular plexus within the graft prior to transplantation. Endothelial cells (EC) cultured as multicellular spheroids within a collagen matrix form sprouts resembling angiogenesis in vitro. However, osteoblasts integrated into the graft suppress EC sprouting. This inhibition depends on direct cell-cell-interactions and is characteristic of mature ECs isolated from preexisting vessels. In contrast, sprouting of human blood endothelial progenitor cells is not inhibited by osteoblasts, making these cells suitable for tissue engineering of pre-vascularized bone grafts.

<ABSTRACT>
Taking advantage of microarray data in Escherichia coli genome, the relationship among mRNA expression levels, folding free energy and codon usage bias are investigated. Our results indicate that mRNA expression is correlated to the stability of mRNA secondary structure and the codon usage bias. The decrease of the stability of mRNA structure contributes to the increase of mRNA expression. There is a negative correlation between codon adaptation index (CAI) and mRNA expression in genes with less stable structure. The relationship between the stability of mRNA structure and mRNA half-life indicates the stability of mRNA structure is different from mRNA half-life.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent lysolipid involved in a variety of biological responses important for cancer progression. Therefore, we investigated the role of sphingosine kinase type 1 (SphK1), the enzyme that makes S1P, in the motility, growth, and chemoresistance of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), an important growth factor for breast cancer progression, activated and translocated SphK1 to plasma membrane. SphK1 was required for EGF-directed motility. Downregulation of SphK1 in MCF-7 cells reduced EGF- and serum-stimulated growth and enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicin, a potent chemotherapeutic agent. These results suggest that SphK1 may be critical for growth, metastasis and chemoresistance of human breast cancers.

<ABSTRACT>
Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on both apo and copper forms of the human copper chaperone, Hah1. Wild-type Hah1 and a methionine (M10) to serine mutant were investigated. We have evidenced the central role of residue M10 in stabilizing the hydrophobic core of Hah1 as well as the internal structure of the metal-binding site. When copper(I) is bound, the mobility of Hah1 is reduced whereas mutation of M10 implies a drastic increase of the mobility of apoHah1, stressing the importance of this highly conserved hydrophobic residue for copper sequestration by the apoprotein.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Alternative cell signal transduction pathways have been demonstrated in some experimental systems. The importance of their existence has not been completely appreciated. In this review we present the cases of alternative pathways resulted from a survey of the available experimental data. The alternative pathways could show different relationships, i.e., synergistic, redundant, additive, opposite and competitive effects. They could have distinct time courses and cell, organ, sex or species specification. Further, they could happen during physiological or pathological situations, and display differentiated sensitivity. These case studies together imply that alternative signal pathways could be involved in the regulation of cell functions at the pathway level. In-depth understanding of the importance of the alternative pathways will rely on building and exploration of mathematical models.

<ABSTRACT>
The present one-drug-one-target paradigm in drug discovery has been considered partially responsible for the more-funding-less-drug predicament in modern pharmaceutical industry. To hit the multiple targets implicated in complex diseases, two strategies, based on multicomponent or single-ingredient, are conceivable. Although the latter is more difficult to be fulfilled than the former, the recent progress made in the fight against Alzheimer's disease (AD) has brought us the first light of success of the latter strategy. In this review, both synthetic and natural multipotent agents are described, which hit two or more targets implicated in AD, e.g., acetylcholinesterase, monoamine oxidase, amyloid-beta, tau protein, metal ions and reactive oxygen species. Nevertheless, due to the potential risks in safety, absorbability and pharmacokinetics of synthetic multipotent agents, natural counterparts seem more promising in the future development.

<ABSTRACT>
Protein ubiquitylation contributes to the regulation of many cellular processes including protein degradation, receptor internalization, and repair of DNA damage. We now present a comprehensive characterization of ubiquitin-conjugated and ubiquitin-associated proteins in human cells. The proteins were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography under denaturing or native conditions. They were then digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by 2-D LC and MS/MS. A total of 670 distinct proteins were identified; 345 proteins (51%) were classified as Urp-D (ubiquitin-related proteome under the denaturing condition) and comprised ubiquitin-conjugated molecules, whereas 325 proteins (49%) were classified as Urp-N (ubiquitin-related proteome only under the native condition) and included molecules that associated with ubiquitylated proteins. The proportions of proteins in various functional categories differed substantially between Urp-D and Urp-N. Many ribosomal subunits were detected in the Urp-D group of proteins and several of these subunits were directly shown to be ubiquitylated by mass spectrometric analysis, suggesting that ubiquitylation might play an important role in the regulation and/or quality control of ribosomal proteins. Our results demonstrate the potential of proteomics analysis of protein ubiquitylation to provide important insight into the regulation of protein stability and other ubiquitin-related cellular functions.

Purification, stabilization, and concentration of very weak
protein-protein complexes: Shifting the association equilibrium via
complex selective adsorption on lowly activated supports.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(16):4062-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Very weak protein-protein interactions are very difficult to detect because these complexes could be under the detection limit or they tend to dissociate. Here, using as a model the antibody-antigen interaction weaken by the presence of dioxane, we have shown a strategy for the protein complexes purification by selective adsorption of the associated proteins. This strategy is based on the use of poorly activated anionic exchanger supports to selectively adsorb large complexes. This selective adsorption of the associated proteins shifted the association equilibrium of the soluble proteins toward the associated form. Thus, in the presence of 15% v/v dioxane, a concentration that is able to almost fully break the immunocomplex (less that 3% of the immunocomplex appeared associated when soluble antigen-antibody mixture was cross-linked with aldehyde-dextran), we can obtain more than 90% of the fully pure immunocomplex from the non-associated protein, adsorbed on anionic exchanger supports having a very low activation. This simple strategy may be a very useful tool to solve one of the most relevant challenges in the modern proteomics, the detection of very weak protein-protein interactions.

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(16):4213-22.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Since completion of genome sequencing of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum, proteomic tools for the identification of parasite proteins have become particularly attractive as they allow a more thorough interpretation of these data. Recent advances in 2-D PAGE, MS, and bioinformatics have created great opportunities for mapping and characterization of protein populations. We employed these improvements in a proteomic approach for the analysis of proteins detected in two blood stages of P. falciparum, (i) in the schizont stage and (ii) in the merozoite stage. For the isolation of merozoites, we introduced a new protocol based on the preparation of clustered structures of merozoites upon treatment of cultures with the common cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64. Peptide mass fingerprints of excised and trypsinated protein spots, acquired by MALDI-TOF MS were generated to identify a variety of proteins. Moreover, prefractionation procedures were used to enrich and map low-abundance proteins in protein samples. The data demonstrate that classic proteomic analyses using 2-D PAGE are now feasible for P. falciparum and represent the first step in the direction of creating 2-D reference maps for this medically most relevant protozoon.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The E7 protein produced by high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) induces a degradation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor RB through direct interaction, which suggests that an inhibitor for the interaction can be a potential anticancer drug. A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging-based protein array chip was developed for the high-throughput screening of inhibitor molecules targeting RB-E7 interaction. The glutathione S-transferase-fused E7 protein (GST-E7) was first layered onto a glutathionylated gold chip surface that had been designed to specifically bind to GST-fused proteins. Subsequently, a microarrayer was used to spot the hexa-histidine-tagged RB proteins (His(6)-RB) onto the GST-E7-layered gold chip surface, and the resulting SPR image was analyzed. Upon increased His(6)-RB concentration in the spotting solution, the SPR signal intensity increased proportionally, indicating that His(6)-RB bound to GST-E7 in a concentration-dependent manner. The His(6)-RB/GST-E7 interaction was challenged by spotting the His(6)-RB solution in the presence of a RB binding peptide (PepC) derived from a motif on E7. The SPR imaging data showed that PepC inhibited the His(6)-RB/GST-E7 interaction in a concentration-dependent manner. Our results show that the SPR imaging-based protein array chip can be applied to screen small molecule inhibitors that target protein-protein interaction.

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(16):4096-106.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In MS/MS experiments with automated precursor ion, selection only a fraction of sequencing attempts lead to the successful identification of a peptide. A number of reasons may contribute to this situation. They include poor fragmentation of the selected precursor ion, the presence of modified residues in the peptide, mismatches with sequence databases, and frequently, the concurrent fragmentation of multiple precursors in the same CID attempt. Current database search engines are incapable of correctly assigning the sequences of multiple precursors to such spectra. We have developed a search engine, ProbIDtree, which can identify multiple peptides from a CID spectrum generated by the concurrent fragmentation of multiple precursor ions. This is achieved by iterative database searching in which the submitted spectra are generated by subtracting the fragment ions assigned to a tentatively matched peptide from the acquired spectrum and in which each match is assigned a tentative probability score. Tentatively matched peptides are organized in a tree structure from which their adjusted probability scores are calculated and used to determine the correct identifications. The results using MALDI-TOF-TOF MS/MS data demonstrate that multiple peptides can be effectively identified simultaneously with high confidence using ProbIDtree.

A top-down proteomics approach for differentiating thermal resistant
strains of Enterobacter sakazakii.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(16):4161-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Thermal tolerance has been identified as an important factor relevant to the pathogenicity of Enterobacter sakazakii in human neonates. To identify a biomarker specific for this phenotypic trait, intact protein expression profiles of 12 strains of E. sakazakii were obtained using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Proteins were extracted from the bacterial cells, separated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography and mass analyzed. At the end of the chromatography run, the uncharged masses of the multiply charged proteins were determined via automated software routines. The resulting data provided an accurate mass expression profile of the proteins found in the individual strains. From the individual expression profiles, it was possible to identify unique proteins corresponding to strains with thermal resistance. One protein found only in the thermal tolerant strains was sequenced and identified as homologous to a hypothetical protein found in the thermal tolerant bacteria, Methylobacillus flagellatus KT. The protein sequence of this protein was then used to reverse-engineer PCR primers for the gene sequence associated with the protein. In all cases, only thermal tolerant strains of E. sakazakii produced amplified PCR products, demonstrating the specificity of this biomarker.

<ABSTRACT>
Presently, phosphorylation of proteins is the most studied and best understood PTM. However, the analysis of phosphoproteins and phosphopeptides is still one of the most challenging tasks in contemporary proteome research. Since not every phosphoprotein is accessible by a certain method and identification of the phosphorylated amino acid residue is required in the majority of cases, various strategies for the detection and localization of phosphorylations have been developed. Identification and localization of protein phosphorylations is mostly done by MS nowadays but phosphoproteins and -peptides are often suppressed in comparison to the unphosphorylated species if measured in complex mixtures. Thus, the isolation of pure phosphopeptide samples is a main task. This review gives an overview over the most frequently used methods in isolation and detection of phosphoproteins and -peptides such as specific enrichment or separation strategies as well as the localization of the phosphorylated residues by various mass spectrometric techniques.

A proteomics approach to identifying fish cell lines.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(16):4236-44.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Fish cell lines are relatively easy to culture and most have simple growth requirements that make cross contamination a potential problem. Cell line contamination is not an uncommon incident in laboratories handling more than one cell line and many reports have been made on cross contamination of mammalian cell lines. Although problems of misidentification and cross-contamination of fish cell lines have rarely been reported, these are issues of concern for cell culturists that can make scientific results and their reproducibility unreliable. Proper identification of cell lines is thus crucial and protocols for routine and rapid screening are preferred. Cytogenetic evaluation, DNA fingerprinting, microsatellite analysis and PCR methods have been published for inter-species identification of many cell lines, but discerning intra-species contamination has been challenging. More complex DNA fingerprinting and hybridization techniques coupled with isoenzyme analysis have been developed to discriminate intra-species contamination, however, these require complex and time consuming procedures to enable cell identification thus are difficult to apply for routine use. A simple proteomic approach has been made to identify several fish cell lines derived from tissues of the same or differing species. Protein expression signatures (PES) of the evaluated fish cell lines have been developed using 2-DE and image analysis. A higher degree of concordance was seen among cell lines derived from rainbow trout, than from other fish species. Similar concordance was seen in cells derived from the same tissues than from other tissues within the same species. These profiles have been saved in an electronic databank and could be made available to be used for discerning the origins of the various cell lines evaluated. This proteomic approach could thus serve as an additional, valuable and reliable technique for the identification of fish cell lines.

<ABSTRACT>
We present reference maps of the mouse serum proteome (run under reducing and non-reducing conditions), from control animals, from mice injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce systemic inflammation, and from mice transgenic for human apolipoproteins A-I and A-II. Seventy-seven spots/spot chains from the reducing gels were identified by HPLC MS/MS, representing 28 distinct proteins, including a species-specific protease inhibitor, contrapsin, and high levels of carboxylesterase. The concentrations of acute-phase reactants were monitored for 96 h after LPS challenge. The greatest changes (four-fold 48 h after LPS administration) were observed for haptoglobin and hemopexin. Orosomucoid/alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein and apolipoprotein A-I increased steadily, to 50-60% above baseline at 96 h from stimulation. In mice transgenic for human apolipoprotein A-I the levels of expression of orosomucoid/alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein, alpha(1)-macroglobulin, esterase, kininogen and contrapsin were altered compared to knockout mice lacking apolipoprotein A-I. In contrast, except for the presence of apolipoprotein A-II, no statistically significant difference was observed in mice transgenic for human apolipoprotein A-II.

Printing of protein microarrays via a capillary-free fluid jetting
mechanism.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(16):4138-44.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Current proteomics experiments rely upon printing techniques such as ink jet, pin, or quill arrayers that were developed for the creation of cDNA microarrays. These techniques often do not meet the requirements needed for successful spotting of proteins to perform high-throughput, array-based proteomic profiling. Biological laser printing (BioLP) is a spotting technology that does not rely on solid pins, quill pins, or capillary-based fluidics. The non-contact mechanism of BioLP utilizes a focused laser pulse to transfer protein solutions, thereby eliminating the potential for orifice clogging, air bubbles, and unnecessary volume loss potentially encountered in commercially available spotting technologies. The speed and spot-to-spot reproducibility of BioLP is comparable to other techniques, while the minimum spot diameter and volume per printed droplet is significantly less at 30 microm and approximately 500 fL, respectively. The transfer of fluid by BioLP occurs through a fluid jetting mechanism, as observed by high-speed images of the printing process. Arraying a solution of BSA with subsequent immunodetection demonstrates the reproducible spotting of protein in an array format with CVs of <3%. Printing of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase followed by a positive reaction with a colorimetric substrate demonstrates that functional protein can be spotted using this laser-based printer.

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(16):4254-63.

<ABSTRACT>
To characterize the mouse bone marrow tissue proteome and investigate the response to radiation damage we took bone marrow before and after 4-Gy gamma-irradiation from mouse strains (C57BL/6 and CBA/Ca) that differ in their short-term and long-term radiation responses and analyzed extracellular proteins by high-resolution 2-DE. Twenty proteins were identified from 71 protein spots in both C57BL/6 and CBA/Ca. We detected significant differences between control and irradiated bone marrow and between genotypes and identified many of the changed proteins by MS. In C57BL/6, 27 spots were significantly different between control and irradiated samples. In CBA/Ca, 18 spots showed significant changes following irradiation. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-I, ferritin, haptoglobin (Hp) and alpha-1-antitrypsin were changed in irradiated bone marrow of both mouse strains, reflecting an ongoing acute-phase reaction. Several other proteins including serotransferrin, neutrophil collagenase, peroxiredoxin 2 and creatine kinase M chain were changed specifically in an individual mouse strain. The proteomic approach makes an important contribution to characterizing bone marrow proteome and investigating the tissue response of bone marrow to radiation, assists in identifying genotype-dependent responses and provides support for the importance of microenvironmental factors contributing to the overall response.

Protein profiles of bovine placenta derived from somatic cell nuclear

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(16):4264-73.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Practical application of animal cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has been hampered by an extremely low success rate. To address whether placental dysfunction in SCNT causes fetal loss during pregnancy, we have used a global proteomics approach using 2-DE and MS to analyze the differential protein patterns of three placentae from the afterbirth of cases of postnatal death, derived from SCNT of Korean Native cattle, and three normal placentae obtained from the afterbirth of fetuses derived from artificial insemination. Proteins within a pI range of 4.0-7.0 and 6.0-9.0 were analyzed separately by 2-DE in triplicate. A total of approximately 2000 spots were detected in placental 2-DE gels stained with CBB. In the comparison of normal and SCNT samples, 60 spots were identified as differentially expressed proteins, of which 33 spots were up-regulated proteins in SCNT placentae, while 27 spots were down-regulated proteins. Most of the proteins identified in this analysis appeared to be related with protein repair or protection, cytoskeleton, signal transduction, immune system, metabolism, extracellular matrix and remodeling, transcription regulation, cell structure or differentiation and ion transport. One of up-regulated proteins in SCNT was TIMP-2 protein known to be related to extracellular matrix and remodeling during pregnancy. Western blot analysis showed an increased level of TIMP-2 in SCNT placenta compared to normal. Our results revealed composite profiles of key proteins involved in abnormal placenta derived from SCNT, and suggested expression abnormality of these genes in SCNT placenta, resulting in fetal losses following SCNT.

<ABSTRACT>
The comprehensive study of proteomes has become an important part of attempts to uncover the systemic properties of biological systems. Proteomics provides data of a quality which increasingly fulfills strict requirements of systems biology for quantitative and qualitative information. Notably, proteomics can generate rich datasets that describe dynamic changes of proteomes. On the other hand, large-scale modeling requires the development of mathematic tools that are adequate for the processing of largely uncertain biological data. In this review, recent developments that pave the way for the integration of proteomics into systems biology are discussed. These developments include the standardization of data acquisition and presentation, the increased comprehensiveness of proteomics studies in description of functional status, localization and dynamics of proteins, and advanced modeling approaches.

Stage-dependent increase of orosomucoid and zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein in
urinary bladder cancer.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(16):4296-304.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Identification and characterization of biomarkers in body fluids such as serum or urine serve as a basis for early detection of diseases, particularly of cancer. Performing 2-DE with subsequent MS analyses, conventional immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry we identified two proteins, orosomucoid (ORM) and human zinc-alpha(2)-glycoprotein (ZAG), which were increased in the urine samples of patients with bladder cancer in comparison to the urine samples of healthy volunteers. The highest amount of both proteins was found in invasive bladder cancer stages such as pT2-3. Immunohistochemical studies showed ORM in inflammatory cells but also in endothelial cells of blood vessels within or adjacent to the tumor area and in part of the tumor cells. ZAG was prominent in tumor cells at the tumor invasion front. Additionally, ZAG was localized at the luminal surface of normal urothelium, which switches to the basal side when a superficial papillary tumor was observed. These results show that we have been able to identify two new proteins that may be related to the development of superficial bladder cancer and to its switch to an invasive phenotype.

Pigment epithelium-derived factor is differentially expressed in
peripheral neuropathies.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4558-67.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Peripheral neuropathies are characterized by asymmetrical slowly progressive weakness with no upper motor neuron signs, and can occur either with or without pain. Due to poor knowledge of the disease mechanisms, available pain treatment is very limited. Because of the difficulties and invasiveness involved when performing direct analysis on peripheral and CNS, pathological markers can be searched for in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as an alternative. To investigate pain mechanisms in peripheral neuropathy and find diagnostic markers, CSF samples were analyzed by a differential expression proteomic approach. We studied CSF from: neuropathic patients with pain (PN), without pain (NPN) and healthy controls (CN). 2-DE analysis showed ten protein spots differentially expressed, and six of these were identified by MS. In NPN patients we found an expression level decrease of three pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) protein isoforms. Immunoblot with a specific antibody revealed the presence of additional PEDF isoforms not highlighted by differential expression analysis. Fucose residues on the oligosaccharide chain were found only in the isoforms down regulated in NPN patients. Considered as PEDF has important neurobiological effects, it might be considered an interesting pathology marker.

Protein and peptide identification algorithms using MS for use in
high-throughput, automated pipelines.

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(16):4082-95.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Current proteomics experiments can generate vast quantities of data very quickly, but this has not been matched by data analysis capabilities. Although there have been a number of recent reviews covering various aspects of peptide and protein identification methods using MS, comparisons of which methods are either the most appropriate for, or the most effective at, their proposed tasks are not readily available. As the need for high-throughput, automated peptide and protein identification systems increases, the creators of such pipelines need to be able to choose algorithms that are going to perform well both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. This article therefore provides a review of the currently available core algorithms for PMF, database searching using MS/MS, sequence tag searches and de novo sequencing. We also assess the relative performances of a number of these algorithms. As there is limited reporting of such information in the literature, we conclude that there is a need for the adoption of a system of standardised reporting on the performance of new peptide and protein identification algorithms, based upon freely available datasets. We go on to present our initial suggestions for the format and content of these datasets.

T cell epitope definition by differential mass spectrometry:
identification of a novel, immunogenic HLA-B8 ligand directly from renal
cancer tissue.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):364-74.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In this study, we describe a differential mass spectrometric technique for the immuno-proteomic analysis of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) peptides of a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) biopsy compared with the healthy kidney tissue of the same patient after nephrectomy. Using a stable isotope labeling approach, we could directly compare and relatively quantify 43 MHC-peptide pairs, most of which were present in similar proportions on both normal kidney and tumor. Significantly, two dominant peptides of monoisotopic masses ([M+H](+)) 973.43 u and 967.59 u, respectively, were found exclusively in the tumor sample. One of these was identified as originating from heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a protein involved in induction of apoptosis resistance, immuno-suppression and neoangiogenesis and reported to be up-regulated in various cancer types. Moreover, the corresponding synthetic HO-1-derived peptide was shown to be immunogenic in vitro by generation of CD8+ T cell lines with peptide-specific cytolytic activity. Thus, this peptide is an example of a differentially identified T cell epitope that could be considered as a target for immunotherapy.

<ABSTRACT>
Knowledge of the role of RNA in affecting gene expression has expanded in the past several years. Small RNAs serve as homology guides to target messenger RNAs for destruction at the post-transcriptional level in the experimental technique known as RNA interference and in the silencing of some transgenes. These small RNAs are also involved in sequence-specific targeting of chromatin modifications for transcriptional silencing of transgenes, transposable elements, heterochromatin and some cases of Polycomb-mediated gene silencing. RNA silencing processes in Drosophila are described.

Hypertonic sodium chloride induction of cyclooxygenase-2 occurs

FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 10;579(24):5430-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cellular response to a hypertonic environment is important for fluid clearance in the lung. Hypertonicity modulates prostaglandin synthesis by influencing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in tissues such as liver and kidney via a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent pathway. However, little is known about COX-2 expression in response to hypertonicity in the lung. COX-2 mRNA accumulation induced by hypertonic NaCl was detected after 1 h of treatment, and COX-2 mRNA continued to accumulate until 18 h, the longest time point examined, in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells. This induction was a transcriptional event that occurred in the absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and was the result of enhanced promoter activity, as examined with the use of full-length COX-2 promoter-driven reporter plasmids. The induction of COX-2 expression by hypertonic NaCl did not require the activation of NF-kappaB. The p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, inhibited hypertonic induction of COX-2 expression. We examined whether the hypertonic induction of COX-2 was under the influence of glucocorticoid; we found that COX-2 promoter activity and mRNA and protein levels were depressed by dexamethasone and antagonized by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU486. Our data demonstrate that the induction of COX-2 expression by hypertonic NaCl occurs independently of NF-kappaB and is inhibited by the GR in A549 cells.

<ABSTRACT>
We investigate in detail the structural properties of the monomeric peptide fragment that corresponds to residues 21-31 of beta(2)-microglobulin. As a first step towards the understanding of the mechanism of the amyloid formation, we have performed a replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulation of this peptide with explicit water molecules. We analyze various structural properties as functions of temperature. Although the corresponding part of the native protein is a fully extended beta-strand, our results show that beta-hairpin structures are formed with high frequency around 310 K. We conjecture that this beta-hairpin formation is closely related to the amyloid fibrillogenesis.

Identification of conserved histidines and glutamic acid as key residues

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 10;579(24):5414-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have recently reported that RPE65 from the retinal pigment epithelium is the isomerohydrolase, a critical enzyme in the visual cycle for regeneration of 11-cis retinal, the chromophore for visual pigments. Here, we demonstrated that mutation of any one of the absolutely conserved four histidine and one glutamic acid residues to alanine in RPE65 abolished its isomerohydrolase activity. Substitution of the conserved glutamic acid with glutamine also resulted in loss of the activity. Moreover, these mutations significantly reduced protein stability of RPE65. These results indicate that these conserved residues are essential for the isomerohydrolase activity of RPE65 and its stability.

Role of sodium in mitochondrial membrane depolarization induced by P2X7
receptor activation in submandibular glands.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 10;579(24):5407-13. Epub 2005 Sep 20.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The effect of ATP on mitochondrial membrane depolarization in rat submandibular glands was investigated. Exposure of the cell suspension to high concentrations of ATP induced a sustained depolarization of mitochondrial membrane. This effect was blocked in the presence of magnesium and reproduced by low concentrations of 2',3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate (BzATP), suggesting the implication of the P2X(7) purinergic receptor. This point was confirmed by comparison of the response to ATP by wild-type and P2X(7) knock-out (P2X(7)R(-/-)) mice. Mitochondria took up calcium after ATP stimulation but the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane by ATP was not affected by the removal of calcium from the extracellular medium. It was nearly fully suppressed in the absence of sodium and partially blocked by the mitochondrial Na/Ca exchanger inhibitor 7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,5-dihydro-4,1-benzothiazepin-2(3H)-one (CGP-37157). Both ATP and monensin increased the uptake of extracellular sodium (as shown by the depolarization of the plasma membrane) but the sodium ionophore did not affect the mitochondrial membrane potential. It is concluded that the activation of P2X(7) receptors depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane. The uptake of extracellular sodium is necessary but not sufficient to induce this response.

MDR-like ABC transporter AtPGP4 is involved in auxin-mediated lateral root
and root hair development.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 10;579(24):5399-5406.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Previous data have suggested an involvement of MDR/PGP-like ABC transporters in transport of the plant hormone auxin and, recently, AtPGP1 has been demonstrated to catalyze the primary active export of auxin. Here we show that related isoform AtPGP4 is expressed predominantly during early root development. AtPGP4 loss-of-function plants reveal enhanced lateral root initiation and root hair lengths both known to be under the control of auxin. Further, atpgp4 plants show altered sensitivities toward auxin and the auxin transport inhibitor, NPA. Finally, mutant roots reveal elevated free auxin levels and reduced auxin transport capacities. These results together with yeast growth assays suggest a direct involvement of AtPGP4 in auxin transport processes controlling lateral root and root hair development.

pK(a) values of ionizable residues were calculated for the crystal structures describing the pH and NO binding dependant conformations of nitrophorin 4, a pH sensitive NO carrier heme protein. Comparison of resultant H-bonding patterns allowed the identification of the amino acids that take part in signaling pH change. We carried out MD simulations to show that the protonation state of Asp30, buried in the closed conformation, is crucial for maintaining the tight packed conformation of the closed form of the complex - presenting a model for the functional decrease of NO binding affinity of nitrophorins at physiological pH.

<ABSTRACT>
We show that the drosophila gene encoding the dystrophin-like protein (DLP) is as complex as the mammalian dystrophin gene. Three 5' promoters and three internal promoters regulate the expression of three full-length and three truncated products, respectively. The existence of this complex gene structure in such evolutionary remote organisms suggests that both types of products have diverse important functions. The promoters of both the DLP gene and the mammalian dystrophin gene are located in very large introns. These introns contribute significantly to the large size of the genes. The possible relevance of the conservation of the large size of introns containing promoters to the regulation of promoter activity is discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is the most toxic species known to humans and has been identified as a potential bioterrorist threat. Unfortunately, the only existing countermeasures for BoNT intoxication involve vaccinations that are only effective prior to entry of the toxin into neuronal cells. Herein, we disclose the ability of the micronutrient riboflavin (vitamin B(2)) to photooxidatively inactivate BoNT in cell-based assays without the need for toxin and riboflavin pre-exposure. In total, this study suggests that botulism neurotoxicity may be blunted with photodynamic therapy technology.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 31;579(26):5974-81. Epub 2005 Sep 20.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Successful applications of RNAi in mammalian cells depend upon effective knockdown of targeted transcripts and efficient intracellular delivery of either preformed si/shRNAs or vector expressed si/shRNAs. We have previously demonstrated that 27 base pair double stranded RNAs which are substrates for Dicer can be up to 100 times more potent than 21mer siRNAs. In this mini-review we elaborate upon the rationale and design strategies for creating Dicer substrate RNAs that provide enhanced knockdown of targeted RNAs and minimize the utilization of the sense strand as RNAi effectors. Expression of shRNAs or siRNAs in mammalian cells can be achieved via transcription from either Pol II or Pol III promoters. There are certain constrictions in designing such vectors, and these are described here. Additionally, we review strategies for inducible shRNA expression and the various viral vectors that can be used to transduce shRNA genes into a variety of cells and tissues. The overall goal of this mini-review is to provide an overview of available approaches for optimizing RNAi mediated down regulation of gene expression in mammalian cells via RNA interference. Although the primary focus is the use of RNAi mediated cleavage of targeted transcripts, it is highly probable that some of the approaches described herein will be applicable to RNAi mediated inhibition of translation and transcriptional gene silencing.

<ABSTRACT>
RNAi is a conserved gene-specific regulatory mechanism, which silences target gene expression transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. The RNAi machinery converts the sequence specific information of a long double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) into small 21-22 nt long dsRNAs (siRNAs, miRNAs) which assemble into an effector complex, the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC assembly is asymmetric; one strand of an siRNA or a miRNA preferentially incorporates into the RNA-protein complex. Here, I review the rules of the asymmetric RISC formation and discuss their possible regulatory function in several steps in RNAi.

<ABSTRACT>
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) specifically induces apoptosis in tumor cells but may be toxic to human hepatocytes. Although hepatocytes are susceptible to apoptotic signals mediated by TRAIL-receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2), we previously reported that some anti-TRAIL-R2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) produce little hepatocyte toxicity. Those mAbs neutralized the cytotoxic activity of TRAIL by inhibiting receptor-ligand binding. The hepatocyte-toxic mAbs did not compete with TRAIL for binding to TRAIL-R2, and potentiated ligand activity in both cancer cells and hepatocytes. A neutralizing antibody to TRAIL inhibited hepatocyte death by anti-TRAIL-R2 mAbs, suggesting that the toxicity may reflect their ability to potentiate membrane-bound TRAIL on hepatocytes.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Metabolic activation of inert chemicals to electrophilic intermediates has been correlated with the incidence and severity of cytotoxicity. The current studies have identified several proteins adducted by reactive metabolites of the lung toxicant, naphthalene. Proteins isolated from microsomal incubations of (14)C-naphthalene were separated by 2-DE, proteins were blotted to PVDF membranes and radioactive proteins were localized by storage phosphor analysis. Adducted proteins were isolated from complimentary gels and identified by peptide mass mapping. A total of 18 adducted proteins were identified including: protein disulfide isomerase precursor, ER-60 protease, alpha actin, mouse urinary proteins, and cytochrome b5 reductase. In supernatant fractions, protein disulfide isomerase, heat shock protein 70, and alpha-actin were key proteins to which reactive naphthalene metabolites were bound. All of the proteins adducted, with the exception of cytochrome b5 reductase were sulfhydryl rich. Although several of the proteins found to be adducted in these studies have also been shown to be adducted by other electrophiles, several others have not been reported as common targets of reactive metabolites. These studies provide a basis for both in situ and in vivo work designed to follow the fate and formation of reactive metabolite protein adducts.

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(16):4205-12.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The development of the testis is essential for maturation of male mammals. A complete understanding of proteins expressed in the testis will provide biological information on many reproductive dysfunctions in males. The purposes of this study were to apply a proteomic approach to investigating protein composition and to establish a 2-D PAGE reference map for porcine testis proteins. MALDI-TOF MS was performed for protein identification. When 1 mg of total proteins was assayed by 2-D PAGE and stained with colloidal CBB, more than 400 proteins with a pI of pH 3-10 and M(r) of 10-200 kDa could be detected. Protein expression varied among individuals, with CV between 4.7 and 131.5%. A total of 447 protein spots were excised for identification, among which 337 spots were identified by searching the mass spectra against the NCBInr database. Identification of the remaining 110 spots was unsuccessful. A 2-D PAGE-based porcine testis protein database has been constructed on the basis of the results and will be published on the WWW. This database should be valuable for investigating the developmental biology and pathology of porcine testis.

<ABSTRACT>
To identify proteins associated with the histological subtypes of lymphoid neoplasms, we studied the proteomes of 42 cell lines from human lymphoid neoplasms including Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL; four cell lines), B cell malignancies (19 cell lines), T cell malignancies (16 cell lines), and natural killer (NK) cell lymphoma (three cell lines). The protein spots were sequentially selected by (i) Wilcoxon or Kruskal-Wallis tests to find the spots whose intensity was significantly (p <0.05) different among the cell line groups, (ii) by statistical-learning methods to prioritize the spots according to their contribution to the classification, and (iii) by unsupervised classification methods to validate the classification robustness by the selected spots. The selected spots discriminated (i) between HL cells and other cells, (ii) between the cells from B cell malignancies, T cell malignancies, and NK cell lymphoma cells, and (iii) between HL cells and anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells. Among the 31 informative protein spots, MS identified 24 proteins corresponding to 23 spots. Previous reports did not correlate these proteins to lymphocyte differentiation, suggesting that a proteomic study would identify the novel mechanisms responsible for the histogenesis of lymphoid neoplasms. These proteins may have potential as differential diagnostic markers for lymphoid neoplasms.

Snake venomics: comparative analysis of the venom proteomes of the

<ABSTRACT>
The protein composition of the crude venoms of the three most important vipers of Tunisia was analyzed by RP-HPLC, N-terminal sequence analysis, MALDI-TOF mass determination, and in-gel tryptic digestion followed by PMF and CID-MS/MS of selected peptide ions in a quadrupole-linear IT instrument. Our results show that the venom proteomes of Cerastes cerastes, Cerastes vipera, and Macrovipera lebetina are composed of proteins belonging to a few protein families. However, each venom showed distinct degree of protein composition complexity. The three venoms shared a number of protein classes though the relative occurrence of these toxins was different in each snake species. On the other hand, the venoms of the Cerastes species and Macrovipera lebetina each contained unique components. The comparative proteomic analysis of Tunisian snake venoms provides a comprehensible catalogue of secreted proteins, which may contribute to a deeper understanding of the biological effects of the venoms, and may also serve as a starting point for studying structure-function correlations of individual toxins.

Performance validation of an improved Xenon-arc lamp-based CCD camera
system for multispectral imaging in proteomics.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4354-66.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Advances in gel-based nonradioactive protein expression and PTM detection using fluorophores has served as the impetus for developing analytical instrumentation with improved imaging capabilities. We describe a CCD camera-based imaging instrument, equipped with both a high-pressure Xenon arc lamp and a UV transilluminator, which provides broad-band wavelength coverage (380-700 nm and UV). With six-position filter wheels, both excitation and emission wavelengths may be selected, providing optimal measurement and quantitation of virtually any dye and allowing excellent spectral resolution among different fluorophores. While spatial resolution of conventional fixed CCD camera imaging systems is typically inferior to laser scanners, this problem is circumvented with the new instrument by mechanically scanning the CCD camera over the sample and collecting multiple images that are subsequently automatically reconstructed into a complete high-resolution image. By acquiring images in succession, as many as four different fluorophores may be evaluated from a gel. The imaging platform is suitable for analysis of the wide range of dyes and tags commonly encountered in proteomics investigations. The instrument is unique in its capabilities of scanning large areas at high resolution and providing accurate selectable illumination over the UV/visible spectral range, thus maximizing the efficiency of dye multiplexing protocols.

Isolation of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes from infected cells by
tandem affinity purification.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4483-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The biochemical purification and analysis of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) of negative-strand RNA viruses is hampered by the lack of suitable tags that facilitate specific enrichment of these complexes. We therefore tested whether fusion of the tandem-affinity-purification (TAP) tag to the main component of viral RNPs, the nucleoprotein, might allow the isolation of these RNPs from cells. We constitutively expressed TAP-tagged nucleoprotein of Borna disease virus (BDV) in cells persistently infected with this virus. The TAP-tagged bait was efficiently incorporated into viral RNPs, did not interfere with BDV replication and was also packaged into viral particles. Native purification of the tagged protein complexes from BDV-infected cells by two consecutive affinity columns resulted in the isolation of several viral proteins, which were identified by MS analysis as the matrix protein, the two forms of the nucleoprotein and the phosphoprotein. In addition to the viral proteins, RT-PCR analysis revealed the presence of viral genomic RNA. Introduction of further protease cleavage sites within the TAP-tag significantly increased the purification yield. These results demonstrate that purification of TAP-tagged viral RNPs is possible and efficient, and may therefore provide new avenues for biochemical and functional studies of these complexes.

Elucidation of subfamily segregation and intramolecular coevolution of the
olfactomedin-like proteins by comprehensive phylogenetic analysis and gene

<ABSTRACT>
The categorization of genes by structural distinctions relevant to biological characteristics is very important for understanding of gene functions and predicting functional implications of uncharacterized genes. It was absolutely necessary to deploy an effective and efficient strategy to deal with the complexity of the large olfactomedin-like (OLF) gene family sharing sequence similarity but playing diversified roles in many important biological processes, as the simple highest-hit homology analysis gave incomprehensive results and led to inappropriate annotation for some uncharacterized OLF members. In light of evolutionary information that may facilitate the classification of the OLF family and proper association of novel OLF genes with characterized homologs, we performed phylogenetic analysis on all 116 OLF proteins currently available, including two novel members cloned by our group. The OLF family segregated into seven subfamilies and members with similar domain compositions or functional properties all fell into relevant subfamilies. Furthermore, our Northern blot analysis and previous studies revealed that the typical human OLF members in each subfamily exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns, which in turn supported the segregation of the OLF subfamilies with functional divergence. Interestingly, the phylogenetic tree topology for the OLF domains alone was almost identical with that of the full-length tree representing the unique phylogenetic feature of full-length OLF proteins and their particular domain compositions. Moreover, each of the major functional domains of OLF proteins kept the same phylogenetic feature in defining similar topology of the tree. It indicates that the OLF domain and the various domains in flanking non-OLF regions have coevolved and are likely to be functionally interdependent. Expanded by a plausible gene duplication and domain couplings scenario, the OLF family comprises seven evolutionarily and functionally distinct subfamilies, in which each member shares similar structural and functional characteristics including the composition of coevolved and interdependent domains. The phylogenetically classified and preliminarily assessed subfamily framework may greatly facilitate the studying on the OLF proteins. Furthermore, it also demonstrated a feasible and reliable strategy to categorize novel genes and predict the functional implications of uncharacterized proteins based on the comprehensive phylogenetic classification of the subfamilies and their relevance to preliminary functional characteristics.

<ABSTRACT>
Ferric uptake regulator protein (Fur) is activated by its cofactor iron to a state that binds to a specific DNA sequence called 'Fur box'. Using mass spectrometry-based methods, we showed that Tyr 55 of Escherichia coli Fur, as well as the two thymines in positions 18 and 19 of the consensus Fur Box, are involved with binding. A conformational model of the Fur-DNA complex is proposed, in which DNA is in contact with each H4 [A52-A64] Fur helix. We propose that this interaction is a common feature for the Fur-like proteins, such as Zur and PerR, and their respective DNA boxes.

<ABSTRACT>
RACK1 has been shown to interact with several proteins, this suggesting that it may play a central role in cell growth regulation. Some recent articles have described RACK1 as a component of the small ribosomal subunit. To investigate the relationship between RACK1 and ribosome, we analyzed RACK1 mRNA structure and regulation. Translational regulation was studied in HeLa cells subjected to serum or amino acid deprivation and stimulation. The results show that RACK1 mRNA has a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine sequence and that its translation is dependent on the availability of serum and amino acids in exactly the same way as any other vertebrate ribosomal protein mRNA.

Mature beta-hexosaminidase A has been found associated to the external leaflet of plasma membrane of cultured fibroblasts. The plasma membrane association of beta-hexosaminidase A has been directly determined by cell surface biotinylation followed by affinity chromatography purification of the biotinylated proteins, and by immunocytochemistry. The immunological and biochemical characterization of biotinylated beta-hexosaminidase A revealed that the plasma membrane associated enzyme is fully processed, suggesting its lysosomal origin.

<ABSTRACT>
Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are diverse enzymes of biotechnological and medical importance. Bioinformatics contributes to our understanding of GH structure and function in various ways, including dissection of their typically modular structures and detection of the distant evolutionary relationships between families that often allow for prediction of catalytic sites. Here these twin strands are applied to the recently described GH98 family, the founder member of which is a blood group glycotope-cleaving endo-beta-galactosidase of potential medical importance from Clostridium perfringens. Three domains can be discerned including a central catalytic TIM barrel domain in which putative catalytic residues can be assigned. Distant homologies and domain contexts suggest that the N-terminal domain is a novel carbohydrate binding module.

We show by mathematical modelling that a two-level protein cascade can act as a band-pass filter for time-limited oscillations. The band-pass filters are then combined into a network of three-level signalling cascades that by filtering the frequency of time-limited oscillations selectively switches cellular processes on and off. The physiological relevance for the selective regulation of cellular processes is demonstrated for the case of regulation by time-limited calcium oscillations.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 24;579(25):5577-81. Epub 2005 Sep 28.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) inhibits muscle fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) about 44 times stronger than the liver isozyme. The key role in strong AMP binding to muscle isozyme play K20, T177 and Q179. Muscle FBPase which has been mutated towards the liver enzyme (K20E/T177M/Q179C) is inhibited by AMP about 26 times weaker than the wild-type muscle enzyme, but it binds the fluorescent AMP analogue, 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-monophosphate (TNP-AMP), similarly to the wild-type liver enzyme. The reverse mutation of liver FBPase towards the muscle isozyme significantly increases the affinity of the mutant to TNP-AMP. High affinity to the inhibitor but low sensitivity to AMP of the liver triple mutant suggest differences between the isozymes in the mechanism of allosteric signal transmission.

<ABSTRACT>
Zabrotes subfasciatus is a devastating starch-dependent storage bean pest. In this study, we attempted to identify novel alpha-amylase inhibitors from wild bean seeds, with efficiency toward pest alpha-amylases. An inhibitor named Phaseolus vulgaris chitinolytic alpha-amylase inhibitor (PvCAI) was purified and mass spectrometry analyses showed a protein with 33330 Da with the ability to form dimers. Purified PvCAI showed significant inhibitory activity against larval Z. subfasciatus alpha-amylases with no activity against mammalian enzymes. N-terminal sequence analyses showed an unexpected high identity to plant chitinases from the glycoside hydrolase family 18. Furthermore, their chitinolytic activity was also detected. Our data provides compelling evidence that PvCAI also possessed chitinolytic activity, indicating the emergence of a novel alpha-amylase inhibitor class.

<ABSTRACT>
ADAM12, adisintegrin and metalloprotease, has been demonstrated to be upregulated in human malignant tumors and to accelerate the malignant phenotype in a mouse model for breast cancer. ADAM12 is a substrate for beta1 integrins and may affect tumor and stromal cell behavior through its binding to beta1 integrins. Here, we report that cells deficient in beta1 integrin or overexpressing beta3 integrin can bind to recombinant full-length human ADAM12 via beta3 integrin. Furthermore, cell binding to ADAM12 via beta3 integrin results in the formation of focal adhesions, which are not formed upon beta1 integrin-mediated cell attachment. We also show that RhoA is involved in beta3 integrin-mediated focal adhesion formation.

<ABSTRACT>
The adiponectin paralog CORS-26 (collagenous repeat-containing sequence of 26kDa protein) is a member of the C1q/TNF-alpha molecular superfamily. CORS-26 is a secreted protein and baculovirus-produced CORS-26 released in the supernatant of insect cells forms stable trimers. Adiponectin exerts anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-treated monocytic cells and CORS-26 also reduces IL-6 and TNF-alpha secretion but does not increase IL-10. Suppression of NFkappaB signalling may explain the anti-inflammatory actions of CORS-26. Furthermore CORS-26 protein was detected in human monocytic and dendritic cells. The present data demonstrate for the first time that CORS-26 forms trimers, exerts anti-inflammatory properties and that it is expressed in monocytic cells. Therefore CORS-26 may provide a new target for pharmacological drugs in inflammatory diseases like the metabolic syndrome.

<ABSTRACT>
The neurodegenerative disorder X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is caused by ABCD1 mutations and characterized by very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) accumulation. Cholesterol-lowering normalized VLCFA in fibroblasts and plasma of X-ALD patients. We show that in cultured cells, cholesterol-loading induces ABCD1. In X-ALD mice, plasma cholesterol is elevated and not further increasable by cholesterol-feeding, whereas hepatic HMG-CoA reductase and Abcd2 are downregulated. Upon cholesterol modulation, brain VLCFA increased in X-ALD mice, but decreased in controls. In murine X-ALD fibroblasts, cholesterol-lowering did not normalize VLCFA. Thus, ALDP-deficiency and VLCFA are linked to cholesterol but species differences complicate evaluating cholesterol-lowering drugs in X-ALD mice.

<ABSTRACT>
Pyrococcus furiosus superoxide reductase (SOR) is a thermostable archaeal enzyme that reduces superoxide without producing oxygen. When produced as a fusion protein with the green fluorescent protein in plant cells, P. furiosus SOR is located in the cytosol and nucleus. The recombinant SOR enzyme retains its function and heat stability when assayed in vitro. Importantly, expressing SOR in plant cells enhances their survival at high temperature indicating that it functions in vivo. The archaeal SOR provides a novel mechanism to reduce superoxide and demonstrates the potential for using archaeal genes to alter eukaryotic metabolism.

<ABSTRACT>
The ubiquitously expressed protein Ser/Thr phosphatase-1 isoforms PP1alpha, PP1beta and PP1gamma1 are dynamically targeted to distinct, but overlapping cellular compartments by associated proteins. Within the nucleus of HeLa cells, EGFP-tagged PP1gamma1 and PP1beta were predominantly targeted to the nucleoli, while PP1alpha showed a more diffuse distribution. Using PP1 chimaeras and point mutants we show here that a single N-terminal residue, i.e., Gln20 for PP1alpha, Arg19 for PP1beta and Arg20 for PP1gamma1 accounts for their distinct subnuclear distribution. Our data also suggest that the N-terminus of PP1beta and PP1gamma1 harbours an interaction site for one or more nucleolar interactors.

<ABSTRACT>
CD14, CD68 and/or mouse F4/80 or human epidermal growth factor module-containing mucin-like receptor 1 (EMR1) are widely used as macrophage-specific markers. Since macrophages infiltrate several tissues during inflammatory processes, CD14, CD68 and EMR1-F4/80 have been employed to discriminate between tissue-containing macrophages, like adipose tissue (AT), and other cells. Using real-time PCR experiments, we show that isolated adipocytes from humans and mice AT express high levels of CD14 and CD68 mRNA, whereas EMR1-F4/80 is mainly present in the macrophage-containing stroma-vascular fraction. Furthermore, fibroblasts-like cells (adipoblasts), preadipocytes and adipocytes from the murine cell lines, 3T3-F442A and BFC-1, express CD14 and CD68 mRNA and protein as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, but not F4/80 which, as expected, is strongly expressed in the macrophage cell line RAW264.7. These results reinforce the view that EMR1-F4/80 is the best macrophage marker to date and show that CD14 and CD68 are not macrophage-specific proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Processing of precursor proteins by the proprotein convertases is thought to occur mainly in the trans-Golgi network or post-Golgi compartments. Such cleavage is inhibited by the prosegment of the convertases. During our studies of the use of the inhibitory prosegment of PC1, we noticed that a construct containing the prosegment fused to the C-terminal secretory granule sorting domain was cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at a pair of basic residues, best recognized by furin and PC7. This was further confirmed when this construct was fused at the C-terminus with a KDEL ER-retention signal. This suggests that the convertases could cleave some substrates within the ER, possibly by displacing the inhibitory prosegment associated with them.

<ABSTRACT>
Periodontitis, a common infectious disease, is initiated by various gram-negative bacteria and characterized by the destruction of the periodontal tissue. Here, we investigated the role of caspases, intracellular proteases that are the key mediators of apoptosis. We show that activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 is considerably enhanced in gingival tissue from patients with periodontitis. We also demonstrate in in vitro experiments that various periodontopathic bacteria exert a direct growth-suppressing effect and, moreover, can trigger a host-mediated cytotoxic activity involving the CD95 death receptor. Our data suggest that caspase activation is a prominent feature in periodontitis-associated tissue injury.

Members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family possess various numbers of ligand binding repeats that non-equally contribute to binding of minor group human rhinoviruses. Using an artificial concatemer of five copies of repeat 3 of the human very-low density lipoprotein receptor, we demonstrate protection of HRV2 against low-pH mediated uncoating and inhibition of penetration of an RNA-specific fluorescent dye into the intact virion. This indicates that the recombinant receptor inhibits viral breathing and irreversible conformational modifications of the capsid that precede RNA release, providing a new mechanism for rhinovirus neutralization by soluble receptor molecules.

<ABSTRACT>
Cytokines may provide signals for regulating human monocyte matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity. In this study, we investigated the roles of interferons (IFN) type I/II and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in MMP-9-mediated invasiveness. MMP-9 antibody and inhibitor, IFNs and TGF-beta1 inhibited monocyte transmigration through Matrigel. IFNs and TGF-beta1 downregulated MMP-9 mRNA, protein and activity levels. The inhibitory action of IFNs was associated with the STAT1/IRF-1 pathway since the JAK inhibitor AG490 blocked STAT1 phosphorylation, IRF-1 synthesis and counteracted the blockade of MMP-9 release. TGF-beta1-mediated MMP-9 inhibition appeared STAT1/IRF-1-independent but reversed by the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin 25. Our data point out the importance of IFNs and TGF-beta1 in the control of monocyte MMP-9-mediated extravasation.

<ABSTRACT>
Adaptation to cold and warm conditions requires dramatic change in gene expression. The acclimatization process of the common carp Cyprinus carpio L. in its natural habitat has been used to study how organisms respond to natural environmental changes. At the cellular level, adaptation to cold condition is accompanied by a dramatic alteration in nucleolar structure and a down regulation of the expression of ribosomal genes. We show that the enrichment of condensed chromatin in winter adapted cells is not correlated with an increase of the heterochromatin marker trimethyl and monomethyl K20H4. However, the expression of the tri methyl K4 H3 and of the variant histone macroH2A is significantly increased during the winter season together with a hypermethylation of CpG residues. Taking into account the properties of macroH2A toward chromatin structure and dynamics and its role in gene repression our data suggest that the increased expression of macroH2A and the hypermethylation of DNA which occurs upon winter-acclimatization plays a major role for the reorganization of chromatin structure and the regulation of gene expression during the physiological adaptation to a colder environment.

How can elongation factors EF-G and EF-Tu discriminate the functional
state of the ribosome using the same binding site?

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Elongation factors EF-G and EF-Tu are structural homologues and share near-identical binding sites on the ribosome, which encompass the GTPase-associated centre (GAC) and the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL). The SRL is fixed structure in the ribosome and contacts elongation factors in the vicinity of their GTP-binding site. In contrast, the GAC is mobile and we hypothesize that it interacts with the alpha helix D of the EF-Tu G-domain in the same way as with the alpha helix A of the G'-domain of EF-G. The mutual locations of these helices and GTP-binding sites in the structures of EF-Tu and EF-G are different. Thus, the orientation of the GAC relative to the SRL determines whether EF-G or EF-Tu will bind to the ribosome.

A single glutamine synthetase gene produces tissue-specific subcellular
localization by alternative splicing.

<ABSTRACT>
Glutamine synthetase (GS) plays a key role in two major biochemical pathways: In liver GS catalyzes ammonia detoxification, whereas in neural tissues it also functions in recycling of the neurotransmitter glutamate. In most species the GS gene gives rise to a cytoplasmic protein in both liver and neural tissues. However, in species that utilize the ureosmotic or uricotelic system for ammonia detoxification, the enzyme is cytoplasmic in neural tissues, but mitochondrial in liver cells. Since most vertebrates have a single copy of the GS gene, it is not clear how tissue-specific subcellular localization is achieved. Here we show that in the ureosmotic elasmobranch, Squalus acanthias (spiny dogfish), two different GS transcripts are generated by tissue-specific alternative splicing. The liver transcript contains an alternative exon that is not present in the neural one. This exon leads to acquisition of an upstream in-frame start codon and formation of a mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS). Therefore, the liver product is targeted to the mitochondria while the neural one is retained in the cytoplasm. These findings present a mechanism in which alternative splicing of an MTS-encoding exon is used to generate tissue-specific subcellular localization.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Here, we describe the biological activity of ME1, a mouse single chain Fv fragment (scFv) against the common epitope of mutant p53, which is efficiently expressed in mammalian cells. We found that in vivo interaction of the conformational p53 mutant R175H protein with the scFv resulted in the acquisition of wild-type p53 characteristics, manifested in trans-activation of p21, as well as induction of apoptosis. Moreover, antibody binding leads to abrogation of the mutant p53 mediated "gain of function" as estimated by downregulation of EGR-1, a transcriptional target of mutant p53. These findings suggest that the scFv restores wild-type properties to mutant p53.

Activation of phospholipase D by 8-Br-cAMP occurs through novel pathway
involving Src, Ras, and ERK in human endometrial stromal cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 24;579(25):5635-42. Epub 2005 Sep 29.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We investigated the mechanism of 8-Br-cAMP-mediated phospholipase D (PLD) activation using a primary cell culture system of human endometrial stromal cells (ES cells). PLD activity was increased by the treatment of ES cells with 8-Br-cAMP, maximally at 5 min. To determine whether the effects of 8-Br-cAMP on PLD occurred as a consequence of PKC activation, ES cells were preincubated for 15 min with RO320432 (1 microM) and GF109203X (1 microM), the PKC inhibitors, or they were pretreated for 24h with phorbol myristate acetate (100 nM) to downregulate PKC. However, these treatments had no effects on PLD activation induced by 8-Br-cAMP. Furthermore, 8-Br-cAMP had no effects on the subcellular distribution of PKC alpha and PKC betaI, confirming no involvement of PKC. 8-Br-cAMP activated ERK1/2, maximally at 5 min, and PD98059 (MEK inhibitor: 50 microM) and transfection of ES cells with dominant negative (DN)-MEK completely inhibited 8-Br-cAMP-induced PLD activation, suggesting that ERK1/2 mediates the PLD activation. To investigate the involvement of protein kinase A (PKA), Src, and Ras in 8-Br-cAMP-induced PLD activation, we used PKA inhibitor, H89 and Rp-cAMPs, and transfections of DN-Src and DN-Ras. H-89 and Rp-cAMPs completely blocked 8-Br-cAMP-mediated PLD and ERK activation, implying the involvement of PKA in this PLD activation. In addition, transfection of ES cells with DN-Src, or DN-Ras partially inhibited 8-Br-cAMP-induced ERK1/2 and consequently PLD activation, whereas cotransfection of DN-Src and DN-Ras completely inhibited ERK1/2 and PLD activation, suggesting that Src and Ras independently regulate ERK/PLD activation. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel pathway in ES cells that 8-Br-cAMP activate PLD through PKA and ERK1/2 and this ERK/PLD activation by 8-Br-cAMP is mediated by Src and Ras, separately.

Inhibition of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase by phosphorylation at

<ABSTRACT>
We demonstrate that neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) is directly inhibited through the phosphorylation of Thr(1296) in NG108-15 neuronal cells. Treatment of NG108-15 cells expressing nNOS with calyculin A, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A, revealed a dose-dependent inhibition of nNOS enzyme activity with concomitant phosphorylation of Thr(1296) residue. Cells expressing a phosphorylation-deficient mutant in which Thr(1296) was changed to Ala proved resistant to phosphorylation and suppression of NOS activity. Mimicking phosphorylation mutant of nNOS in which Thr(1296) is changed to Asp showed a significant decrease in nNOS enzyme activity, being competitive with NADPH, relative to the wild-type enzyme. These data suggest that phosphorylation of nNOS at Thr(1296) may involve the attenuation of nitric oxide production in neuronal cells through the decrease of NADPH-binding to the enzyme.

<ABSTRACT>
In the model P450 BM3 system, the P450 is fused to its diflavin reductase partner in a single polypeptide. BM3 dimerizes in solution, but the catalytic relevance of the phenomenon was hitherto unknown. We show that BM3 fatty acid hydroxylase specific activity decreases sharply at low enzyme concentrations, consistent with separation of active dimer into inactive monomer. Reductase-dependent specific activities are maintained or enhanced at low concentration, suggesting inter-flavin electron transfer is unaffected. Fatty acid oxidation is reconstituted by mixing inactive oxygenase (A264H) and FMN-depleted (G570D) mutants, demonstrating that inter-monomer (FMN(1)-to-heme(2)) electron transfer supports oxygenase activity in the BM3 dimer.

<ABSTRACT>
We hypothesized that catecholamines through beta-adrenoceptor might modulate macrophage function. We showed that isoproterenol concentration-dependently induced HO-1 production through beta(1)-but not beta(2)-adrenoceptor. Production was increased by forskolin and inhibited by pretreatment with the PKA inhibitor, H-89. Furthermore, induction of HO-1 by isoproterenol effectively protected RAW264.7 cells from effects of glucose oxidase treatment, which was abrogated either by HO-1 inhibitor, ZnPP IX and beta-adenoceptor antagonist, propranolol. Thus, stimulation of HO-1 production through beta(1)-adenoceptors, and via the PKA pathways by isoproterenol, can enable RAW264.7 cells to resist oxidant stress, suggesting that catecholamine hormones may be necessary, at least, to maximize defending role of macrophages.

<ABSTRACT>
We have employed NMR to investigate the structure of SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein dimer. We found that the secondary structure of the dimerization domain consists of five alpha helices and a beta-hairpin. The dimer interface consists of a continuous four-stranded beta-sheet superposed by two long alpha helices, reminiscent of that found in the nucleocapsid protein of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus. Extensive hydrogen bond formation between the two hairpins and hydrophobic interactions between the beta-sheet and the alpha helices render the interface highly stable. Sequence alignment suggests that other coronavirus may share the same structural topology.

<ABSTRACT>
RNA interference (RNAi) is broadly defined as a gene silencing pathway that is triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Many variations have been described on this theme. The dsRNA trigger can be supplied exogenously, as an experimental tool, or can derive from the genome in the form of microRNAs. Gene silencing can be the result of nucleolytic degradation of the mRNA, or by translational suppression. At the heart of the pathway are two ribonuclease machines. The ribonuclease III enzyme Dicer initiates the RNAi pathway by generating the active short interfering RNA trigger. Silencing is effected by the RNA-induced silencing complex and its RNaseH core enzyme Argonaute. This review describes the discovery of these machines and discusses future lines of work on this amazing biochemical pathway.

<ABSTRACT>
Yeast Golgi ecto-ATPase Ynd1p is an unusual type III membrane protein with the longest translocated N-terminus reported. Sequential deletion analysis reveals that translocation of this 500-residue-long hydrophilic domain across the membranes requires the C-terminal transmembrane domain of Ynd1p and its flanking regions. Additional studies indicate that the topogenic sequence of Ynd1p overrides the effect of a reverse signal-anchor sequence present at the N-terminus of Ynd1p, while it is not affected by a classic signal sequence at the N-terminus. When placed at the C-terminal end, the sequence can translocate large extracellular domains of two membrane proteins across the membranes. The data demonstrate the existence of a true eukaryotic C-terminal signal sequence.

The effects of partial thiamin deficiency and oxidative stress (i.e.,

protein adducts in Fischer 344 rats.

<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 24;579(25):5596-602. Epub 2005 Sep 28.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We hypothesized that in marginal thiamin deficiency intracellular alpha-oxoaldehydes form macromolecular adducts that could possibly be genotoxic in colon cells; and that in the presence of oxidative stress these effects are augmented because of decreased detoxification of these aldehydes. We have demonstrated that reduced dietary thiamin in F344 rats decreased transketolase activity and increased alpha-oxoaldehyde adduct levels. The methylglyoxal protein adduct level was not affected by oral glyoxal or methylglyoxal in the animals receiving thiamin at the control levels but was markedly increased in the animals on a thiamin-reduced diet. These observations are consistent with our suggestion that the induction of aberrant crypt foci with marginally thiamin-deficient diets may be a consequence of the formation of methylglyoxal adducts.

<ABSTRACT>
The effects of progesterone derivatives on breast cancer development are still controversial, probably accounting for their biphasic, opposed effects on mammary cell-cycle regulation. Here, we demonstrate in vitro that the growth-inhibitory effects of progesterone on breast cancer T-47D cells require the transcriptional upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) (p27) gene. A statistical analysis of human tumor biopsies further indicates that p27 mRNA levels correlate to progesterone receptor (PR) levels. Moreover, p27 gene expression is inversely associated with tumor aggressiveness, and is a prognostic factor of favorable disease outcome. Thus, progesterone derivatives selectively activating the p27 gene promoter could be promising drugs against breast cancer progression.

Metabolic regulation at the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles of
the lignin-degrading basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium against
exogenous addition of vanillin.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Oct;5(15):3919-31.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A proteomic differential display technique was utilized to study cellular responses of Phanerochaete chrysosporium exposed to vanillin, one of the key intermediates found during lignin biodegradation. Intracellular proteins were resolved by 2-DE and target protein spots were identified using MALDI-MS after in-gel tryptic digestions. Upon addition of vanillin to P. chrysosporium, up-regulation of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, 1,4-benzoquinone reductases, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase, which seem to play roles in vanillin metabolism, was observed. Furthermore, enzymes involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the pentose-phosphate cycle, and heme biosynthesis were also activated. Up-regulation of extracellular peroxidase was also observed. One of the most unique phenomena against exogenous vanillin was a switch from the glyoxylate cycle to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, where a drastic increase in isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was observed. The exogenous addition of other aromatic compounds also caused an increase in its activity, which in turn triggered NAD(P)H production via the action of dehydrogenases in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, heme biosynthesis via the action of aminolevulinic acid synthase on succinyl-CoA, and energy production via activation of the mitochondrial electron transfer system. These metabolic shifts seem to be required for activating a metabolic system for aromatic compounds.

Transgenic mice expressing mutant (N279K) human tau show mutation

FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 24;579(25):5704-12. Epub 2005 Oct 5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Mutations in the tau gene, which is located on chromosome 17, were found causative for autosomal dominantly inherited frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). To determine if cognitive deficits could be caused by tau mutations, two transgenic mouse lines were generated expressing a four-repeat isoform of human tau or its mutant, containing one of the FTDP-17 mutations (WILD mice and N279K mice). In open field test, N279K mice showed hyperactivity in locomotion and rearing. In prepulse inhibition test, N279K mice but not Wild mice showed significant deficits. Both transgenic mice, especially N279K mice, showed impairment in acquisition of spatial learning in Morris water maze. Although both N279K mice and Wild mice acquired passive avoidance as well as non-transgenic mice, N279K mice but not Wild mice showed severe deficits in acquisition of active avoidance. Histological analysis of the present mutant mice did not show any signs of neurofibrillary tangle formations in the brain, and cognitive dysfunction seemed to precede such neuropathological changes or occur independently from them. The behavioral phenotype of N279K mice mimics features of human FTDP-17 and provides a basic model for elucidating mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in not only FTDP-17, but also diverse tauopathies.

Intracellular processing of the Sendai virus C' protein leads to the

FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 24;579(25):5685-90. Epub 2005 Oct 5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Sendai virus "C-proteins" (C', C, Y1 and Y2) are a nested set of non-structural proteins. The shorter Y proteins arise in vivo both by de novo translation initiation and by proteolytic processing of C'. In this paper, we demonstrate that C' but not C (differing only by 11 N-terminal amino acid) serves as an efficient substrate for intracellular processing. However, processing can be mimicked in vitro by the addition of endopeptidases. Under conditions of limited proteolysis we observed that in a fraction of the C' protein the Y region exists as a proteinase resistant core. This core was conserved in the C protein. We propose that C' functions as a Pro-protein delivering the Y module to a specific intracellular location.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
To examine whether cold-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression in brown adipose tissue involved generation of hypoxic oxygen levels by thermogenic processes, we cold-exposed wild-type mice, as well as uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1)-ablated mice in which no thermogenesis in brown adipocytes can be induced. Cold exposure stimulated VEGF expression in both wild-type and UCP1-ablated mice. Unexpectedly, the effect was 3-fold higher in UCP1-ablated animals, whereas cultured brown adipocytes from both genotypes responded identically to norepinephrine stimulation. These results demonstrate that generation of low oxygen levels does not contribute to cold-induced VEGF expression in brown adipose tissue, but the results are consistent with an adrenergic regulation of expression.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Antifungal lipodepsipeptide syringomycin E (SRE) forms two major conductive states in lipid bilayers: "small" and "large". Large SRE channels are cluster of several small ones, demonstrating synchronous opening and closure. To get insight into the mechanism of such synchronization we investigated how transmembrane potential, membrane surface charge, and ionic strength affect the number of small SRE channels synchronously functioning in the cluster. Here, we report that the large SRE channels can be presented as 3-8 simultaneously gating small channels. The increase in the absolute value of the transmembrane potential (from 50 to 200 mV) decreases the number of synchronously gated channels in the clusters. Voltage-dependence of channel synchronization was influenced by the ionic strength of the bathing solution, but not by membrane surface charge. We propose a mechanism for the voltage-dependent cluster behavior that involves a voltage-induced reorientation of lipid dipoles associated with the channel pores.

<ABSTRACT>
Hic-5/ARA55 is a LIM-only member of the paxillin superfamily. Conflicting reports have suggested that Hic-5/ARA55 can both repress and enhance a number of biological processes, including myogenesis and tumorigenesis. With two Hic-5 isoforms documented, we hypothesized that multiple Hic-5 isoforms may exist that have both overlapping and isoform-specific functions. To test this hypothesis, we performed an extensive analysis of Hic-5 transcripts in both cell lines and mouse tissues and found 12 distinct isoforms that fall into two sub-families. These isoforms are derived from both alternative splicing and alternative transcriptional start sites (TSS). Hic-5 expression is regulated in a temporally and spatially controlled manner in vivo. The identification of numerous Hic-5 isoforms suggests that Hic-5 subsumes a number of distinct roles in cells and may explain the range of biological responses attributed to Hic-5.

The refinement of protein structures determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy against database potentials of mean force allows for the exclusion of unfavourable conformations of the protein backbone during a structure calculation, resulting in protein structures with a marked improvement in Ramachandran statistics. In this communication, we use multiple sets of residual dipolar couplings as quality assessment criteria for several proteins and show that not only do the Ramachandran and structural quality statistics improve, but a significant improvement in the accuracy of structures is achieved upon refinement.

Pomiferin, a prenylated isoflavonoid from Derris malaccensis with strong anti-fungal and anti-oxidant activities, showed cytotoxic activity towards human cholangiocarcinoma cells (HuCCA-1), with IC(50) of 0.9 microg/mL. Pomiferin caused apoptosis, detectable by DNA fragmentation. Two-dimensional PAGE showed increased expression of 12 proteins, namely glucose-regulated protein 75 (grp 75), calcyclin (S100A6), degraded cytokeratin 19, ATP synthase D, ribosomal protein P0, degraded cytokeratin 18 (two spots pI/MW 6.03/29.9 and pI/MW 4.66/21.5), cofilin, annexin A1, triose phosphate isomerase, peroxiredoxin-1, calgizzarin, and profilin. In contrast, cytokeratins (CK) 7, 18 and 19 were down-regulated, and were shown by 1-DE immunodetection to be degraded.

Derivatization with a 1:1 mixture of acetic anhydride and deuterated acetic anhydride incorporates a stable isotope label into the analyzed molecule. This approach has been initially applied to FAB. Using MS/MS, the technique provides a fast, highly sensitive and reliable determination of the primary structure of unknown peptides. This procedure labels N-terminal fragments formed during MS/MS analysis, resulting in a simplification and faster interpretation of the spectra. The performance of the method has been tested with several synthetic peptides and applied to an efficient sequencing of the peptide map, using a nano-scale LC coupled on-line to a tandem mass spectrometer.

<ABSTRACT>
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death among women. Due to the asymptomatic nature and poor survival characteristic of the disease, screening for specific biomarkers for ovarian cancer is a major health priority. Differentially expressed proteins in the serum of ovarian cancer patients have the potential to be used as cancer-specific biomarkers. In this study, proteomic methods were used to screen 24 serum samples from women with high-grade ovarian cancer and compared to a control group of 11 healthy women. Affigel-Blue treated serum samples were processed either by linear (pH 4-7) or narrow range (pH 5.5-6.7) IEF strips for the first dimension. Proteins separated in first dimension were resolved by 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE. Protein spots were visualized by SYPRO Ruby staining, imaged by FX-imager and compared and analyzed by PDQuest software. Twenty-two protein spots were consistently differentially expressed between normal and ovarian cancer patients by resolving proteins in a linear pH strip of 4-7 for the first dimension. Six of the protein spots, significantly up-regulated in grade 3 ovarian cancer patients (p < 0.05), were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and Western blotting as the isoforms of haptoglobin precursor. When serum proteins were resolved on narrow pH range strips (5.5-6.7), 23 spots were consistently differentially expressed between normal and grade 3 ovarian cancer patients. Of these, 4 protein spots significantly down regulated in grade 3 ovarian cancer patients (p < 0.05) were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and Western blotting, as isoforms of transferrin precursor. Increased expression of serum haptoglobin and transferrin was also identified in peritoneal tumor fluid obtained from women diagnosed with grade 2/3 ovarian cancer (n = 7). Changes in the expression of haptoglobin and transferrin in the serum of women with different pathological grades of ovarian cancer was examined by one-dimensional Western blotting method. Serum samples collected from women suffering from benign, borderline, grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3 cancer (n = 4 for haptoglobin and n = 5 for transferrin in each group) were analyzed and compared to the serum of normal healthy women. The mean serum haptoglobin expression in grade 3 ovarian cancer patients was fourfold higher than in the control subjects (p < 0.05). On the other hand, transferrin expression in grade 3 ovarian cancer patients was decreased by twofold than in normal healthy women (p < 0.05). Haptoglobin expression in the serum of cancer patients (n = 7) decreased following chemotherapy (six cycles of taxol/carboplatin). Concomitant with the decrease of haptoglobin, transferrin expression remained constant in four patients, but increased in three out of seven patients included in the study. Changes in serum expression of haptoglobin correlated with the change of CA 125 levels before and after chemotherapy. In conclusion, proteomic profiling of differentially expressed proteins in the sera of normal women compared to women with ovarian cancer can greatly facilitate the discovery of a panel of biomarkers that may aid in the detection of ovarian cancer with greater specificity.

Proteome of endothelial cell-derived procoagulant microparticles.

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4443-55.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Microparticles (MP) are small membrane vesicles that are released from cells upon activation or during apoptosis. Cellular MP in body fluids constitute a heterogeneous population, differing in cellular origin, numbers, size, antigenic composition and functional properties. MP support coagulation by exposure of tissue factor (TF), the initiator of coagulation in vivo. Moreover, MP may transfer bioactive molecules to other cells, thereby stimulating them to produce cytokines, cell-adhesion molecules, growth factors and TF, and modulate endothelial functions. However, a comprehensive characterization of the antigenic composition of MP has been poorly defined. This study describes the protein composition of endothelial cell (EC)-derived MP (EMP) using a proteomic approach. MS analysis indicated the presence of newly described protein such as metabolic enzymes, proteins involved in adhesion and fusion processes, members of protein folding event, cytoskeleton associated proteins and nucleosome. In conclusion, circulating EMP behave as an actual storage pool, able to disseminate blood-borne TF activity and other bioactive effectors, as confirmed by our experiments showing an increased procoagulant activity of EC exposed to EMP.

Proteomic analysis of the excretory-secretory proteins of the Trichinella
spiralis L1 larva, a nematode parasite of skeletal muscle.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4525-32.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Trichinella spiralis is an intracellular nematode parasite of mammalian skeletal muscle. Infection of the muscle cell leads to the formation of a host-parasite complex that results in profound alterations to the host cell and a re-alignment of muscle-specific gene expression. The role of parasite excretory-secretory (ES) proteins in mediating these effects is currently unknown, largely due to the difficulty in identifying and assigning function to individual proteins. In this study, a global proteomics approach was used to analyse the ES proteins from T. spiralis muscle larvae. Following 2-DE of ES proteins,MALDI-TOF-MS and LC-MS/MS were used to identify the peptide spots. Specific Trichinella EST databases were assembled and used to analyse the data. Despite the current absence of a Trichinella genome-sequencing project, 43 out of 52 protein spots analysed were identified and included the major secreted glycoproteins. Other novel proteins were identified from matches with sequences in the T. spiralis database. Our results demonstrate the value of proteomics as a tool for the identification of Trichinella ES proteins and in the study of the molecular mechanism underpinning the formation of the host-parasite complex during Trichinella infections.

Proteomics-based consensus prediction of protein retention in a bacterial
membrane.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4472-82.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The availability of complete bacterial genome sequences allows proteome-wide predictions of exported proteins that are potentially retained in the cytoplasmic membranes of the corresponding organisms. In practice, however, major problems are encountered with the computer-assisted distinction between (Sec-type) signal peptides that direct exported proteins into the growth medium and lipoprotein signal peptides or amino-terminal membrane anchors that cause protein retention in the membrane. In the present studies, which were aimed at improving methods to predict protein retention in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, we have compared sets of membrane-attached and extracellular proteins of Bacillus subtilis that were recently identified through proteomics approaches. The results showed that three classes of membrane-attached proteins can be distinguished. Two classes include 43 lipoproteins and 48 proteins with an amino-terminal transmembrane segment, respectively. Remarkably, a third class includes 31 proteins that remain membrane-retained despite the presence of typical Sec-type signal peptides with consensus signal peptidase recognition sites. This unprecedented finding indicates that unknown mechanisms are involved in membrane retention of this class of proteins. A further novelty is a consensus sequence indicative for release of certain lipoproteins from the membrane by proteolytic shaving. Finally, using non-overlapping sets of secreted and membrane-retained proteins, the accuracy of different signal peptide prediction algorithms was assessed. Accuracy for the prediction of protein retention in the membrane was increased to 82% using a majority-vote approach. Our findings provide important leads for future identification of surface proteins from pathogenic bacteria, which are attractive candidate infection markers and potential targets for drugs or vaccines.

Advantages and limitations of clear-native PAGE.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4338-46.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Clear-native PAGE (CN-PAGE) separates acidic water-soluble and membrane proteins (pI < 7) in an acrylamide gradient gel, and usually has lower resolution than blue-native PAGE (BN-PAGE). The migration distance depends on the protein intrinsic charge, and on the pore size of the gradient gel. This complicates estimation of native masses and oligomerization states when compared to BN-PAGE, which uses negatively charged protein-bound Coomassie-dye to impose a charge shift on the proteins. Therefore, BN-PAGE rather than CN-PAGE is commonly used for standard analyses. However, CN-PAGE offers advantages whenever Coomassie-dye interferes with techniques required to further analyze the native complexes, e.g., determination of catalytic activities, as shown here for mitochondrial ATP synthase, or efficient microscale separation of membrane protein complexes for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses. CN-PAGE is milder than BN-PAGE. Especially the combination of digitonin and CN-PAGE can retain labile supramolecular assemblies of membrane protein complexes that are dissociated under the conditions of BN-PAGE. Enzymatically active oligomeric states of mitochondrial ATP synthase previously not detected using BN-PAGE were identified by CN-PAGE.

<ABSTRACT>
The thermophilic bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus TLS33 was examined under cold-shock stress by a proteomic approach to gain a better understanding of the protein synthesis and complex regulatory pathways of bacterial adaptation. After downshift in the temperature from 65 degrees C, the optimal growth temperature for this bacterium, to 37 degrees C and 25 degrees C for 2 h, we used the high-throughput techniques of proteomic analysis combining 2-DE and MS to identify 53 individual proteins including differentially expressed proteins. The bioinformatics database was used to search the biological functions of proteins and correlate these with gene homology and metabolic pathways in cell protection and adaptation. Eight cold-shock-induced proteins were shown to have markedly different protein expression: glucosyltransferase, anti-sigma B (sigma(B)) factor, Mrp protein homolog, dihydroorthase, hypothetical transcriptional regulator in FeuA-SigW intergenic region, RibT protein, phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase and prespore-specific transcriptional activator RsfA. Interestingly, six of these cold-shock-induced proteins are correlated with the signal transduction pathway of bacterial sporulation. This study aims to provide a better understanding of the functional adaptation of this bacterium to environmental cold-shock stress.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can differentiate into different types of cells, and serve as a good model system to study human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We showed that mESCs differentiated into two types of neurons with different time courses. To determine the global protein expression changes after neural differentiation, we employed a proteomic strategy to analyze the differences between the proteomes of ES cells (E14) and neurons. Using 2-DE plus LC/MS/MS, we have generated proteome reference maps of E14 cells and derived dopaminergic neurons. Around 23 proteins with an increase or decrease in expression or phosphorylation after differentiation have been identified. We confirmed the downregulation of translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) and upregulation of alpha-tubulin by Western blotting. We also showed that TCTP was further downregulated in derived motor neurons than in dopaminergic neurons, and its expression level was independent of extracellular Ca(2+) concentration during neural differentiation. Potential roles of TCTP in modulating neural differentiation through binding to Ca(2+), tubulin and Na,K-ATPase, as well as the functional significance of regulation of other proteins such as actin-related protein 3 (Arp3) and Ran GTPase are discussed. This study demonstrates that proteomic tools are valuable in studying stem cell differentiation and elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms.

Grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance: a cell and protein microarray
platform.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4432-42.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance (GCSPR) is a method for the accurate assessment of analyte in a multiplexed format using small amounts of sample. In GCSPR, the analyte is flowed across specific receptors (e.g. antibodies or other proteins) that have been immobilized on a sensor chip. The chip surface is illuminated with p-polarized light that couples to the gold surface's electrons to form a surface plasmon. At a specific angle of incidence, the GCSPR angle, the maximum amount of coupling occurs, thus reducing the intensity of reflected light. Shifts in the GCSPR angle can be correlated with refractive index increases following analyte capture by chip-bound receptors. Because regions of the chip can be independently analyzed, this system can assess 400 interactions between analyte and receptor on a single chip. We have used this label-free system to assess a number of molecules of immunological interest. GCSPR can simultaneously detect an array of cytokines and other proteins using the same chip. Moreover, GCSPR is also compatible with assessments of antigen expression by intact cells, detecting cellular apoptosis and identifying T cells and B cells. This technology represents a powerful new approach to the analysis of cells and molecular constituents of biological samples.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Scab, caused by Fusarium graminearum, is a serious spike disease in wheat. To identify proteins in resistant wheat cultivar Wangshuibai induced by F. graminearum infection, proteins extracted from spikes 6, 12 and 24 h after inoculation were separated by 2-DE. Thirty protein spots showing 3-fold change in abundance when compared with treatment without inoculation were characterized by MALDI-TOF MS and matched to proteins by querying the mass spectra in protein databases or the Triticeae EST translation database. Based on their volume profiles, these proteins were classified into four categories. The first one fell off rapidly at the initial inoculation and then rose at 12 or 24 hai, the second one decreased considerably after inoculation and remained at low level, the third one rose at the initial inoculation and then declined at 12 or 24 hai, the forth one showed steady increase after inoculation and maintained at a high level. Many of the proteins identified in the first two categories are related to carbon metabolism and photosynthesis. While most of proteins identified in the last two categories are related to stress defense of plants, indicating that proteins associated with the defense reactions were activated or translated shortly after inoculation.

Proteomic analysis of mouse liver plasma membrane: use of differential

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4510-24.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
To comprehensively identify proteins of liver plasma membrane (PM), we isolated PMs from mouse liver by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. An optimized extraction method for whole PM proteins and several methods of differential extraction expected to enrich hydrophobic membrane proteins were tested. The extracted PM proteins were separated by 2-DE, and were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS, and ESI-quadrupole-TOF MS. As the complementary method, 1-DE-MS/MS was also used to identify PM proteins. The optimized lysis buffer containing urea, thiourea, CHAPS and NP-40 was able to extract more PM proteins, and treatment of PM samples with chloroform/methanol and sodium carbonate led to enrichment of more hydrophobic PM proteins. From the mouse liver PM fraction, 175 non-redundant gene products were identified, of which 88 (about 50%) were integral membrane proteins with one to seven transmembrane domains. The remaining products were probably membrane-associated and cytosolic proteins. The function distribution of all the identified liver PM proteins was analyzed; 40% represented enzymes, 12% receptors and 9% proteins with unknown function.

Monocrotaline pyrrole targets proteins with and without cysteine residues
in the cytosol and membranes of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4398-413.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A single injection of monocrotaline produces a pulmonary insult in rats with a phenotype similar to human primary pulmonary hypertension. Although extensively used as a model, the mechanism(s) by which this chemical insult mimics a condition with genetic and environmental links remains an enigma, although formation of protein adducts has been implicated. Monocrotaline (MCT) is non-toxic and must undergo hepatic dehydrogenation to the soft electrophile monocrotaline pyrrole as prerequisite to damaging endothelial cells lining arterioles at remote pulmonary sites. In this report we extend our earlier investigation (J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 29091-29099) by examining protein adducts to lower abundance adducts, a pI range not covered before, and subcellular localization of adduct-forming proteins associated with plasma membranes. Human pulmonary artery endothelial cells were exposed to [(14)C]MCT pyrrole (MCTP) and protein targets were identified using 2-DE with IPG 4-11. Adducted proteins were identified by pI, apparent molecular weight, and PMF using MALDI-TOF MS. Results of this study show that the majority of adducts form on proteins that contain reactive thiols in a CXXC motif, such as protein disulfide isomerase A(3) (ERp57), protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and endothelial PDI. These same proteins were the major adduct-forming proteins associated with the plasma membrane. Other proteins found to be targets were thioredoxin, galectin-1, reticulocalbin 1 and 3, cytoskeletal tropomyosin, mitochondrial ATP synthase beta-chain, annexin A2 and cofilin-1. For the first time, MCTP adducts were observed on proteins not known to contain cysteine residues. However, known reactive proteins including nucleophosmin did not form detectable adducts, potentially indicating that MCTP did not reach the interior of nucleus to the same extent as other cellular sites. These findings suggest that molecular events underlying MCTP toxicity are initiated at the plasma membrane or readily accessible subcellular regions including the cytosol and membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4389-97.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A novel method termed metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC) of enriching for phosphorylated proteins and peptides based on the affinity of the phosphate group for Al(OH)(3) is presented here. When compared to commercial phosphoprotein-enrichment kits, this method is more selective, more cost effective and easily applicable to method optimization. The use of glutamic and aspartic acid in the loading buffer significantly enhances selectivity. Standard protein mixtures and complex Arabidopsis thaliana leaf protein extracts were tested for efficacy of enrichment. The method can be applied to proteins extracted using either mild or denaturing conditions. The same Al(OH)(3) material is suitable for the enrichment of phosphopeptides out of a tryptic digest of alpha-casein. Peptide phosphorylation was revealed by beta-elimination of phosphate groups. Enrichment and in vivo phosphorylation of A. thaliana leaf proteins were confirmed with Pro-Q diamond stain. Several of the phosphoprotein candidates that were identified by MS are known to be phosphorylated in vivo in other plant species.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 31;579(26):5872-8. Epub 2005 Sep 27.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Heterochromatin is an epigenetically heritable and conserved feature of eukaryotic chromosomes with important roles in chromosome segregation, genome stability, and gene regulation. The formation of heterochromatin involves an ordered array of chromatin changes, including histone deacetylation, histone H3-lysine 9 methylation, and recruitment of histone binding proteins such as Swi6/HP1. Recent discoveries have uncovered a role for the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in heterochromatin assembly in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and other eukaryotes. Purification of two RNAi complexes, RITS and RDRC, from fission yeast has provided further insight into the mechanism of RNAi-mediated heterochromatin assembly. These discoveries have given rise to a model in which small interfering RNA molecules act as specificity factors that initiate epigenetic chromatin modifications and double strand RNA synthesis at specific chromosome regions.

<ABSTRACT>
We investigated the fourth subgroup of Arabidopsis aquaporin, small and basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs). When they were expressed in yeast, SIP1;1 and SIP1;2, but not SIP2;1, gave water-channel activity. The transient expression of SIPs linked with green fluorescent protein in Arabidopsis cells and the subcellular fractionation of the tissue homogenate showed their ER localization. The SIP proteins were detected in all of the tissues, except for dry seeds. Histochemical analysis of promoter-beta-glucuronidase fusions revealed the cell-specific expression of SIPs. SIP1;1 and SIP1;2 may function as water channels in the ER, while SIP2;1 might act as an ER channel for other small molecules or ions.

Differential selectivity of protein modification by the cyclopentenone
prostaglandins PGA1 and 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-PGJ2: role of glutathione.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 24;579(25):5803-8. Epub 2005 Oct 6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cyPG) with antiinflammatory and antiproliferative properties have been envisaged as leads for the development of therapeutic agents. Because cyPG effects are mediated in part by the formation of covalent adducts with critical signaling proteins, it is important to assess the specificity of this interaction. By using biotinylated derivatives of 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2) (15d-PGJ(2)-B) and PGA(1) (PGA(1)-B) we herein provide novel evidence for the differential selectivity of protein modification by distinct cyPG. The marked quantitative and qualitative differences in the binding of 15d-PGJ(2)-B and PGA(1)-B to cellular proteins were related to a differential reactivity in the presence of glutathione (GSH), both in vitro and in intact cells. Therefore GSH levels may influence not only the intensity but also the specificity of cyPG action.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 24;579(25):5785-90. Epub 2005 Oct 6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The rat catalase gene carries a TATA-less promoter and its transcriptional mechanism is interesting because of downregulation in liver injury. We characterized the core element in the promoter and found that C/EBP-beta binding downstream of the transcription initiation site plays a crucial role for transcription. The multiple complexes binding to the promoter were composed of homodimers and heterodimers of C/EBP-beta isoforms. Transduction of the C/EBP-beta gene showed complete reconstitution of multiple binding complexes in HeLa cells, similar to normal liver. Furthermore, C/EBP-beta was observed to bind to the endogenous catalase promoter. These data suggest that multiple complex formation of C/EBP-beta regulates transcription in the TATA-less catalase promoter.

<ABSTRACT>
Respiration in all cells depends upon synthesis of ATP by the ATP synthase complex, a rotary motor enzyme. The structure of the catalytic moiety of ATP synthase, the so-called F(1) headpiece, is well established. F(1) is connected to the membrane-bound and ion translocating F(0) subcomplex by a central stalk. A peripheral stalk, or stator, prevents futile rotation of the headpiece during catalysis. Although the enzyme functions as a monomer, several lines of evidence have recently suggested that monomeric ATP synthase complexes might interact to form a dimeric supercomplex in mitochondria. However, due to its fragility, the structure of ATP synthase dimers has so far not been precisely defined for any organism. Here we report the purification of a stable dimeric ATP synthase supercomplex, using mitochondria of the alga Polytomella. Structural analysis by electron microscopy and single particle analysis revealed that dimer formation is based on specific interaction of the F(0) parts, not the F(1) headpieces which are not at all in close proximity. Remarkably, the angle between the two F(0) part is about 70 degrees, which induces a strong local bending of the membrane. Hence, the function of ATP synthase dimerisation is to control the unique architecture of the mitochondrial inner membrane.

Glucose transporter-2 (GLUT2) promoter mediated transgenic insulin
production reduces hyperglycemia in diabetic mice.

<ABSTRACT>
Insulin production afforded by hepatic gene therapy (HGT) retains promise as a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes, but successful approaches have been limited. We employed a novel and previously untested promoter for this purpose, glucose transporter-2 (GLUT2) to drive insulin production via delivery by recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). In vitro, the GLUT2 promoter was capable of robust glucose-responsive expression in transduced HepG2 human hepatoma cells. Therefore, rAAV constructs were designed to express the furin-cleavable human preproinsulin B10 gene, under the control of the murine GLUT2 promoter and packaged for delivery with rAAV expressing the type 5 capsid. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were subjected to hepatic portal vein injection immediately followed by implantation of a sustained-release insulin pellet to allow time for transgenic expression. All mice injected with the rAAV5-GLUT2-fHPIB10 virus remained euglycemic for up to 35 days post-injection, with 50% euglycemic after 77 days post-injection. In contrast, mock-injected mice became hyperglycemic within 15 days post-injection following dissolution of the insulin pellet. Serum levels of both human insulin and C-peptide further confirmed successful transgenic delivery by the rAAV5-GLUT2-fHPIB10 virus. These findings indicate that the GLUT2 promoter may be a potential candidate for regulating transgenic insulin production for hepatic insulin gene therapy in the treatment of type I diabetes.

<ABSTRACT>
Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) is a fundamental mechanism for controlling a wide range of cellular functions. The Drosophila protein Rhomboid-1 (Rho-1) is an intramembrane serine protease that cleaves epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands to release active growth factors. Despite differences in the primary structure of Rhomboid proteins, the proteolytic activity and substrate specificity of these enzymes has been conserved in diverse organisms. Here, we show that an Arabidopsis Rhomboid protein AtRBL2 has proteolytic activity and substrate specificity. AtRBL2 cleaved the Drosophila ligands Spitz and Keren, but not similar proteins like TGFalpha, when expressed in mammalian cells, leading to the release of soluble ligands into the medium. These studies provide the first evidence that the determinants of RIP are present in plants.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ca2+ channel Cch1pMid1p is essential for
tolerance to cold stress and iron toxicity.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 24;579(25):5697-703. Epub 2005 Oct 5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cch1p and Mid1p are components of a high-affinity Ca(2+)-permeable channel in the yeast plasma membrane. Here, we show that growth of mutants in the Cch1pMid1p channel is markedly hypersensitive to low temperature and to high iron concentration in the medium. Both phenotypes were suppressed by high Ca(2+) concentration. Iron stress elicited an increased Ca(2+) influx into both wild type and cch1Deltamid1Delta yeast. Inhibition of calcineurin strongly depressed growth of iron-stressed wild type yeast, indicating that calcineurin is a downstream element of the iron stress response. Iron hypersensitivity of the cch1Deltamid1Delta mutant was not associated with an increased iron uptake. An involvement of oxidative stress in the iron-hypersensitive phenotype was indicated by the findings that the antioxidants tocopheryl acetate and (ethyl)glutathione improved growth and viability of the iron-stressed mutant. Further, the degree of glutathione oxidation was increased in the presence of iron. The results indicate that iron stress leads to an increased oxidative poise and that Cch1pMid1p is essential to tolerate this condition.

Revised structure of the AbrB N-terminal domain unifies a diverse
superfamily of putative DNA-binding proteins.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 24;579(25):5669-74. Epub 2005 Oct 4.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
New relationships found in the process of updating the structural classification of proteins (SCOP) database resulted in the revision of the structure of the N-terminal, DNA-binding domain of the transition state regulator AbrB. The dimeric AbrB domain shares a common fold with the addiction antidote MazE and the subunit of uncharacterized protein MraZ implicated in cell division and cell envelope formation. It has a detectable sequence similarity to both MazE and MraZ thus providing an evolutionary link between the two proteins. The putative DNA-binding site of AbrB is found on the same face as the DNA-binding site of MazE and appears similar, both in structure and sequence, to the exposed conserved region of MraZ. This strongly suggests that MraZ also binds DNA and allows for a consensus model of DNA recognition by the members of this novel protein superfamily.

Proteomic identification of activin receptor-like kinase-1 as a

<ABSTRACT>
The hyaloid vascular system (HVS) is a transient network of capillaries that nourishes the embryonic lens and the primary vitreous of the developing eye. We used proteomic analysis and immunohistochemical staining to identify activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ALK1), a type I receptor for transforming growth factor-beta1, during the HVS regression phase. In addition, we overexpressed ALK1 in corneas implanted with bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) pellets and observed that ALK1 overexpression resulted in inhibition of bFGF-induced corneal neovascularization in vivo. Our data suggest that ALK1 may play a role in HVS regression during ocular development.

<ABSTRACT>
Previously, we found that safrole oxide could trigger vascular endothelial cell (VEC) apoptosis. In this study, to investigate its mechanism to induce apoptosis in VECs, the activities of nitric oxide synthetase and phosphatidylcholine specific phospholipase C, the level of reactive oxygen species and the expressions of Fas, integrin beta4 and P53 were analyzed. The data showed that safrole oxide induced apoptosis by increasing the expressions of Fas, integrin beta4 and P53, and depressing the activity of Ca(2+)-independent phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels in VECs.

The intracellular domain of Notch ligand Delta1 induces cell growth
arrest.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 24;579(25):5798-5802.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Notch signaling involves proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane Notch receptor after binding to its transmembrane ligands, Delta or Jagged; and the resultant soluble intracellular domain of Notch stimulates a cascade of transcriptional events. The Delta1 ligand also undergoes proteolytic cleavage upon Notch binding, resulting in the production of a free intracellular domain. We demonstrate that the expression of the intracellular domain of Delta1 results in a non-proliferating senescent-like cell phenotype which is dependent on the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor, p21, and is abolished by co-expression of constitutively active Notch1. These data suggest a new intracellular role for Delta1.

Osmotic regulation of STAT3 stability in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 24;579(25):5791-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Little is known about the regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) stability. Here the osmolarity-dependence of STAT3 stability, ubiquitination, Tyr(705) phosphorylation, STAT3 transactivation and gamma-fibrinogen (gamma-FBG) expression was studied in hepatoma cells. Hyper-osmolarity accelerated STAT3 degradation which was prevented by proteasome inhibitors. Hypo-osmolarity stabilized STAT3, most likely due to a decrease in STAT3 ubiquitination. Accordingly, STAT3 Tyr(705) phosphorylation, alpha(2)-macroglobulin promoter activity and gamma-FBG expression were osmosensitive. Modulation of STAT3 stability may contribute to a hydration dependence of acute phase protein expression.

Molecular basis for the glyphosate-insensitivity of the reaction of
5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase with shikimate.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 24;579(25):5773-80.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The shikimate pathway enzyme 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSP synthase) has received attention in the past because it is the target of the broad-spectrum herbicide glyphosate. The natural substrate of EPSP synthase is shikimate-3-phosphate. However, this enzyme can also utilize shikimate as substrate. Remarkably, this reaction is insensitive to inhibition by glyphosate. Crystallographic analysis of EPSP synthase from Escherichia coli, in complex with shikimate/glyphosate at 1.5 Angstroms resolution, revealed that binding of shikimate induces changes around the backbone of the active site, which in turn impact the efficient binding of glyphosate. The implications from these findings with respect to the design of novel glyphosate-insensitive EPSP synthase enzymes are discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
The osmotically regulated OpuA uptake system from Bacillus subtilis is a member of the SBP-dependent subfamily of ABC-transporters. The functional complex, OpuA(A(2)B(2)C), catalyzes the osmotically controlled import of the compatible solutes glycine betaine and proline betaine. Here, we describe the purification of the isolated TMS, OpuAB. Stimulated ATPase activity of OpuAA by OpuAB demonstrated that OpuAB adopts a functional fold. An interaction between all subunits could be verified in detergent solution with the highest ATPase stimulation determined for the dimeric NBS in the re-associated complex in the presence of all transport components plus substrate.

NAD-, NMN-, and NADP-dependent modification of dinitrogenase reductases
from Rhodospirillum rubrum and Azotobacter vinelandii.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Oct 24;579(25):5751-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Nitrogenase activity in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum is reversibly regulated by ADP-ribosylation of a specific arginine residue of dinitrogenase reductase based on the cellular nitrogen or energy status. In this paper, we have investigated the ability of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NAD (the physiological ADP-ribose donor), and its analogs to support covalent modification of dinitrogenase reductase in vitro. R. rubrum dinitrogenase reductase can be modified by DRAT in the presence of 2 mM NAD, but not with 2 mM nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). We also found that the apo- and the all-ferrous forms of R. rubrum dinitrogenase reductase are not substrates for covalent modification. In contrast, Azotobacter vinelandii dinitrogenase reductase can be modified by the dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyl transferase (DRAT) in vitro in the presence of either 2 mM NAD, NMN or NADP as nucleotide donors. We found that: (1) a simple ribose sugar in the modification site of the A. vinelandii dinitrogenase reductase is sufficient to inactivate the enzyme, (2) phosphoADP-ribose is the modifying unit in the NADP-modified enzyme, and (3) the NMN-modified enzyme carries two ribose-phosphate units in one modification site. This is the first report of NADP- or NMN-dependent modification of a target protein by an ADP-ribosyl transferase.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Signaling via G-protein coupled receptors is initiated by receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange on Galpha subunits normally bound to GDP and Gbetagamma. Activated Galpha . GTP then regulates effectors such as adenylyl cyclase. Except for Gbetagamma, no known regulators bind the adenylyl cyclase-stimulatory subunit Galphas in its GDP-bound state. We recently described a peptide, KB-752, that binds and enhances the nucleotide exchange rate of the adenylyl cyclase-inhibitory subunit Galpha(i). Herein, we report that KB-752 binds Galpha(s) . GDP yet slows its rate of nucleotide exchange. KB-752 inhibits GTPgammaS-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in cell membranes, reflecting its opposing effects on nucleotide exchange by Galpha(i) and Galpha(s).

<ABSTRACT>
Carnivorous plants usually grow in nutrient-deficient habitats, and thus they partly depend on insects for nitrogen and phosphate needed for amino acid and nucleotide synthesis. We report that a sticky digestive liquid from a sundew, Drosera adelae, contains an abundant amount of an S-like ribonuclease (RNase) that shows high amino acid-sequence similarity to S-like RNases induced by phosphate starvation or wounding in normal plants. By giving leaves an RNase "coat", D. adelae seems to achieve two requirements simultaneously to adapt itself to its specific surroundings: it obtains phosphates from insects, and defends itself against pathogen attack.

<ABSTRACT>
The rate of evolution-related mutation varies widely among proteins while the unity of the organism implies an integrated evolution of its protein network. Focusing on the yeast interactome, we monitored the structural impact of amino acid substitution on yeast proteins with reported structure. The impact of mutation in creating or deleting structural markers for interactivity varies across proteins and modulates the evolutionary rates, yielding a unified kinetic law of accumulation of connectivities consistent with an integrated evolution of the interactome.

Balance of ATPase stimulation and nucleotide exchange is not required for
efficient refolding activity of the DnaK chaperone.

<ABSTRACT>
The DnaK system from Thermus thermophilus (DnaK(Tth)) exhibits pronounced differences in organisation and regulation to its mesophile counterpart from Escherichia coli (DnaK(Eco)). While the ATPase cycle of DnaK(Eco) is tightly regulated by the concerted action of the two cofactors DnaJ(Eco) and GrpE(Eco), the DnaK(Tth) system features an imbalance in this cochaperone mediated regulation. GrpE(Tth) considerably accelerates the ATP/ADP exchange, but DnaJ(Tth) only slightly stimulates ATPase activity, believed to be a key step for chaperone activity of DnaK(Eco). By in vitro complementation assays, we could not detect significant ATPase-stimulation of orthologous DnaJ(Tth) . DnaKEco or DnaJ(Eco). DnaK(Tth)-complexes as compared to the DnaK(Eco) system, although they were nevertheless active in luciferase refolding experiments. Assistance of protein recovery by DnaK thus seems to be uncoupled of the magnitude of DnaJ mediated ATPase-stimulation.

The relation between sphingomyelinase activity, lipid peroxide oxidation
and NO-releasing in mice liver and brain.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We used animal models to study connection between oxidating system and sphingomyelin signaling cascade, because this models are more close related to people disease. Activation of n-sphingomyelinase (n-SMase) in mice liver and brain is coincided in time with increased level of peroxide products (conjugated dienes) after injection of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). We found that ceramide can induce peroxide oxidation and lead to accumulation of TNF-alpha in animal organs. Nitric oxide (NO) donors (S-nitrosoglutathione and dinitrosyl iron complex) reversibly inhibited activity of n-SMase and decreased level of lipid peroxidation products. This data proposed that both SMase and messengers of oxidative systems could be targets for NO-derived oxidants.

<ABSTRACT>
Molecular dynamics simulations were performed for four members of the aquaporin family (AQP1, AQPZ, AQP0, and GlpF) in the explicit membrane environment. The single-channel water permeability, pf, was evaluated to be GlpF approximately AQPZ > AQP1 >> AQP0, while their relative pore sizes were GlpF >> AQP1 > AQPZ >> AQP0. This relation between pf and pore size indicates that water permeability was determined not only by the channel radius, but also another competing factor. Analysis of water dynamics revealed that this factor was the single-file nature of water transport.

<ABSTRACT>
The oligomerization state of the ADP/ATP carrier is an important issue in understanding the mechanism underlying nucleotide exchange across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The first high resolution structure obtained in the presence of carboxyatractyloside revealed a large cavity formed within a monomer in which the inhibitor is strongly bound. Whereas the protein-protein interactions implicated in the first crystal form are not biologically relevant, the new crystal form described herein, highlights favorable protein-protein interactions. The interactions are mediated by endogenous cardiolipins, which are tightly bound to the protein, two cardiolipins being sandwiched between the monomers on the matrix side. The putative dimerization interface evidenced here is consistent with other structural, biochemical or functional data published so far.

Differential CCR1-mediated chemotaxis signaling induced by human CC

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Human CC chemokine-4 (HCC-4)/CCL16 is a chemoattractant for monocytes and lymphocytes. Although HCC-4 binds to multiple CC chemokine receptors, the receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway induced by HCC-4 has not been characterized. Human osteogenic sarcoma cells stably expressing CCR1 were used to investigate HCC-4-mediated chemotaxis signaling events via CCR1. The chemotactic activity of HCC-4 as well as those of other CCR1-dependent chemokines including MIP-1alpha/CCL3, RANTES/CCL5, and Lkn-1/CCL15 was inhibited by the treatment of pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gi/Go protein, U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC), and rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta). These results indicate that HCC-4-induced chemotaxis signaling is mediated through Gi/Go protein, PLC, and PKCdelta. SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase, only blocked the chemotactic activity of HCC-4, but not those of other CCR1-dependent chemokines. SB202190 inhibited HCC-4-induced chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.01). HCC-4 induces p38 activation in both a time and dose-dependent manner. However, such p38 activation was not induced by other CCR1-dependent chemokines. To further investigate the differential effect of HCC-4, the Ca2+ mobilization was examined. HCC-4 induced no intracellular Ca2+ flux in contrast to other CCR1-dependent chemokines. These results indicate that HCC-4 transduces signals differently from other CCR1-dependent chemokines and may play different roles in the immune response.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In p53-dependent apoptosis in response to genotoxic and hypoxic stress, a fraction of induced wild-type p53 rapidly translocates to mitochondria, triggering a rapid first wave of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and apoptosis that is later fortified by the transcriptional program of p53. However, whether this direct mitochondrial program also occurs upon oncogenic stress is unknown. In normal cells, oncogenic signals can induce a p53-dependent fail-safe mechanism to counter uncontrolled proliferation by engaging p53-dependent apoptosis. To address whether mitochondrial p53 contributes to oncogene-induced fail-safe apoptosis, p53 translocation was determined in primary human epithelial and endothelial cells overexpressing c-Myc, E1A or E2F1. Serum starvation of these cells, but not of control cells, triggered rapid p53 accumulation at mitochondria, accompanied by cytochrome c and SMAC release and followed by apoptosis. Our data establishes the contribution of the transcription-independent mitochondrial p53 pathway to apoptosis of primary cells in response to deregulated oncogenes.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 7;579(27):6017-22. Epub 2005 Oct 5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Archaeal prolyl-tRNA synthetases differ from their bacterial counterparts: they contain an additional domain (about 70 amino acids) appended to the carboxy-terminus and lack an editing domain inserted into the class II catalytic core. Biochemical and structural approaches have generated a wealth of information on amino acid and tRNA specificities for both types of ProRSs, but have left a number of aspects unexplored. We report here that the carboxy-terminal domain of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii ProRS is not involved in tRNA binding since its deletion only mildly affects the kinetic parameters for the enzyme. We also demonstrate that M. jannaschii ProRS is a homodimeric enzyme that is functionally asymmetric; only one of the two active sites at a time is able to form prolyl-adenylate, and only one tRNA molecule binds per dimer. Together with previous reports our results show that asymmetry might be a general feature of the aminoacylation reaction catalyzed by dimeric aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases from both classes.

<ABSTRACT>
Progenitor cells may contribute to cardiac regeneration. Here, we investigated the role of cadherins and integrins for differentiation of human adult circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into cardiomyocytes (CM) in a co-culture system. N- and E-cadherin were expressed in EPCs and were localized at the interface between EPCs and CM. Incubation of a blocking antibody against E-cadherin reduced the expression of CM marker protein in EPCs. Blocking antibodies against N- or P-cadherin or the beta1- and beta2-integrins were not effective. These data suggested that cell-to-cell communication mediated by E-cadherin contributes to the acquirement of a cardiomyogenic phenotype of human endothelial progenitor cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Triacylglycerol (TAG) lipases have been thoroughly characterized in mammals and microorganisms. By contrast, very little is known on plant TAG lipases. An Arabidopsis cDNA called AtLip1 (At2g15230), which exhibits strong homology to lysosomal acid lipase, was found to drive the synthesis of an active TAG lipase when expressed in the baculovirus system. The lipase had a maximal activity at pH 6 and the specific activity was estimated to be about 45 micromol min(-1) mg(-1) protein using triolein as a substrate. Knock-out mutant analysis showed no phenotype during germination indicating that this enzyme is fully dispensable for TAG storage breakdown during germination. Northern blot analyses indicated that the transcript is present in all tissues tested.

<ABSTRACT>
The proteolysis of beta-amyloid (Abeta) requires neprylisin, an enzyme that has been shown as reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated whether a decrease in neprilysin levels contributes to the accumulation of amyloid deposits not only in AD but also in the normal aging. We analyzed neprilysin mRNA and protein levels in cerebral cortex from 10 cognitively normal elderly subjects with amyloid plaques (NA), 10 cases of AD, and 10 control cases free of amyloid plaques. We found a significant decrease in neprilysin mRNA levels in both AD and NA compared to control cases. Thereby, the defect of neprilysin appears to correlate with Abeta deposition but not with degeneration and dementia.

CHI-suppression by RNA interference (RNAi) showed reduced pigmentation and change of flavonoid components in flower petals. The plants also accumulated high levels of chalcone in pollen, showing a yellow coloration. Our results first demonstrated that suppression of CHI by genetic transformation is possible in higher plants. This suggests that CHI plays a major part in the cyclization reaction from chalcone to flavanone, and that spontaneous reactions are few, if any, in tobacco plants.

<ABSTRACT>
The polyamine synthesis enzyme spermidine synthase (SPDS) has been cloned from the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Biochemical characterisation of the recombinantly expressed protein revealed a high degree of similarity to other eukaryotic SPDS with the exception of a low affinity towards the substrate decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (Km = 110 microM) and a less pronounced feedback inhibition by the second reaction product 5'-methylthioadenosine (IC50 = 430 microM). The C. elegans protein that carries a nematode-specific insertion of 27 amino acids close to its N-terminus was crystallized, leading to the first X-ray structure of a dimeric eukaryotic SPDS.

Protein S attenuates the invasive potential of THP-1 cells by interfering

<ABSTRACT>
Protein S, a cofactor for activated protein C (aPC) to inactivate coagulation factors, also plays a pivotal role in inflammation. Based on our recent findings that aPC and protein S modifies tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-catalyzed activation of Glu-plasminogen (Glu-plg), we analyzed possible role of protein S in cell-associated plasminogen activation and invasive potential of inflammatory cells. Monocyte-like THP-1 cells, to which both plasminogen and tPA bind, enhanced tPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation, which was partially abolished by protein S but not by aPC. Protein S attenuated both the plasminogen binding to THP-1 cells and associated their invasive potential through Matrigel.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The effect of a synthetic cyclic disulfide compound, SA3443, on neovascularization was investigated. In vitro, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and RT-PCR demonstrated that SA3443 suppressed the expression of the hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at both protein and mRNA levels in ARPE-19 cells. In vivo, the administration of SA3443 to mice with laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) suppressed the leakage from the lesions and reduced their size. Furthermore, the expression level of VEGF protein was significantly reduced by the administration of SA3443. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SA3443 suppresses VEGF production and reduces vascular leakage and the growth of mouse experimental CNV.

<ABSTRACT>
Eukaryotic valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS) and the heavy form of elongation factor 1 (EF-1H) are isolated as a stable high molecular mass complex that catalyzes consecutive steps in protein biosynthesis--aminoacylation of tRNA and its transfer to elongation factor. Herein is the first three-dimensional structure of the particle as calculated from electron microscopic images of negatively stained samples of the human ValRS/EF-1H complex. The ca. 12 x 8 nm particle has two distinct domains and each appears to have twofold symmetry. Bound antibodies place two delta subunits near the particle's center. These data support a dimeric head-to-head arrangement of particle components.

<ABSTRACT>
In order to investigate the role of water network in collagen structure, measurement of dielectric permittivity was performed on bovine Achilles' tendon as a function of water content. The data show a sudden decrease of the permittivity at each measured frequency value when the tendon humidity decreases. A similar behaviour is shown by the total number of photons emitted in delayed luminescence (DL) experiments. The comparison of the two results is in agreement with the hypothesis that DL is connected to the excitation and subsequent decay of collective electronic states, whose properties depend on the organized structure of the system.

<ABSTRACT>
The mechanisms controlling fat depot-specific metabolism are poorly understood. During starvation of mice, downregulation of lipogenic genes, suppression of fatty acid synthesis, and increases in lipid oxidation were all more pronounced in epididymal than in subcutaneous fat. In epididymal fat, relatively strong upregulation of uncoupling protein 2 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase genes was found. In mice maintained both at 20 and 30 degrees C, AMP-activated protein kinase was activated in epididymal but did not change in subcutaneous fat. Our results suggest that AMPK may have a role in the different response of various fat depots to starvation.

Novel sites of cytosolic glutathione peroxidase expression in colon.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 7;579(27):6135-9. Epub 2005 Oct 11.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Glutathione peroxidases (Gpx) are important moderators of oxidative stress that is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases including colon cancer. Previous studies report limited examinations of cytosolic glutathione peroxidase location of expression in colon tissue. This study reports evidence of both common sites of Gpx1 and Gpx2 expression in rat colon and sites that are exclusive to each isoform. Semi-quantitative PCR performed previously demonstrated RNA expression of Gpx1 and Gpx2 in proximal, transverse and distal colon. Mapping the distribution throughout the entire colon has revealed specific, novel sites of glutathione peroxidase expression in colon lymphatic tissue. In situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry confirmed micro-anatomical location of Gpx1 within lymphatic tissue and the lamina propria, sub-mucosa, muscularis and serosa, but not the lumenal epithelium. In situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry were consistent with reports of microanatomical location of Gpx2 in the lumenal epithelium. Novel sites of Gpx2 expression were also observed in lymphatic tissue. Immunolocalisation in the vicinity of aberrant crypt foci was also examined to further investigate the link between glutathione peroxidases and colon cancer. This did not reveal significant abnormalities, nor did measurement of cytosolic glutathione peroxidase activity or gene expression in colon tissue from rats treated with the colontropic chemical, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. These results support the potential for Gpx1 and Gpx2 redundancy in lymphatic tissue, but not in epithelial cells of the colon crypt or in the lamina propria, sub-mucosa, muscularis or serosa.

<ABSTRACT>
HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) is a complex between alpha-lactalbumin and oleic acid that induces apoptosis in tumor cells, but not in healthy cells. Heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to determine the structure of 13C-oleic acid in HAMLET, and to study the 15N-labeled protein. Nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy shows that the two ends of the fatty acid are in close proximity and close to the double bond, indicating that the oleic acid is bound to HAMLET in a compact conformation. The data further show that HAMLET is a partly unfolded/molten globule-like complex under physiological conditions.

<ABSTRACT>
Hemozoin (Hz) is a heme crystal produced upon the digestion of hemoglobin (Hb) by blood-feeding organisms as a main mechanism of heme disposal. The structure of Hz consists of heme dimers bound by reciprocal iron-carboxylate interactions and stabilized by hydrogen bonds. We have recently described heme crystals in the blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, and in the kissing bug, Rhodnius prolixus. Here, we characterized the structures and morphologies of the heme crystals from those two organisms and compared them to synthetic beta-hematin (betaH). Synchrotron radiation X-ray powder diffraction showed that all heme crystals share the same unit cell and structure. The heme crystals isolated from S. mansoni and R. prolixus consisted of very regular units assembled in multicrystalline spherical structures exhibiting remarkably distinct surface morphologies compared to betaH. In both organisms, Hz formation occurs inside lipid droplet-like particles or in close association to phospholipid membranes. These results show, for the first time, the structural and morphological characterization of natural Hz samples obtained from these two blood-feeding organisms. Moreover, Hz formation occurring in close association to a hydrophobic environment seems to be a common trend for these organisms and may be crucial to produce very regular shaped phases, allowing the formation of multicrystalline assemblies in the guts of S. mansoni and R. prolixus.

Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4936-45.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Estrogen deficiency results in a reduced bone mass, which can be prevented by treatment with estrogens. This study used a proteomic approach for the first time to obtain a global perspective of estrogens' effects on whole-bone proteins. Bone proteome profiles were examined in three groups of mice: (1) sham-operated with normal ovarian functions, (2) ovariectomised and (3) ovariectomised with estrogen replacement therapy. Bone proteins extracted from the humerus were separated by 2-DE and visualised by CBB colloidal staining. Spot detection and quantification was done by image analysis. Differentially expressed proteins were identified by MS and database search, using peptide mass fingerprint and peptide sequence analysis. Differential expression analysis in the three experimental groups showed significant changes for 14 proteins. These included proteins related to bone metabolism, cytoskeleton components and energy metabolic pathways. Our data suggest that some proteins related to cytoskeleton and to energy pathways, such as tropomyosins, aconitase 2 and enolase beta, might be new molecular targets responsive to the effects of estrogen. Differentially expressed proteins identified in this model may offer a useful starting point for elucidating novel aspects of the pleiotropic effects of estrogens on bone.

Proteomic characterization of the acid tolerance response in Lactococcus

</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4794-807.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Exponentially growing cells of Lactococcus lactis MG1363 are able to develop an Acid Tolerance Response (ATR) when incubated at pH 5, in both rich (M17)--and chemically defined (SA)--culture media. Physiological and proteomic characterization of this adaptive response indicated that L. lactis reorganizes its metabolism in response to acid stress to a great extent and quite differently in the two media. The development of ATR was fully dependent on protein de novo synthesis in SA and only partly dependent in M17. 2D gel electrophoresis revealed a total of 90 spots induced by acidity, 80 of which were identified by mass spectrometry. Only 10 proteins (BglA, PycA, GlmS, HasC, ArgS, GatA, AtpA, ArcB, Cfa, and SodA) were overproduced in the two media. A transcriptional analysis of the corresponding genes suggested that for half of them the mode of regulation may differ in the two media. Among the protein spots upregulated during the ATR in SA but not in M17, 13 already displayed an elevated rate of synthesis in M17 at neutral pH. These proteins could play an important role in the development of the protein de novo synthesis-independent ATR observed in M17.

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4327-37.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A great need exists for the systematic generation of specific antibodies to explore the human proteome. Here, we show that antibodies specific to human proteins can be generated in a high-throughput manner involving stringent affinity purification using recombinant protein epitope signature tags (PrESTs) as immunogens and affinity-ligands. The specificity of the generated affinity reagents, here called mono-specific antibodies (msAb), were validated with a novel protein microarray assay. The success rate for 464 antibodies generated towards human proteins was more than 90% as judged by the protein array assay. The antibodies were used for parallel profiling of patient biopsies using tissue microarrays generated from 48 human tissues. Comparative analysis with well-characterized monoclonal antibodies showed identical or similar specificity and expression patterns. The results suggest that a comprehensive atlas containing extensive protein expression and subcellular localization data of the human proteome can be generated in an efficient manner with mono-specific antibodies.

Characterization of serum biomarkers for detection of early stage ovarian

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4589-96.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have previously reported the identification of three ovarian cancer biomarker panels comprised of SELDI-TOF-MS peaks representing 14 differentially expressed serum proteins for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Using micro-LC-MS/MS, we identified five m/z peaks as transthyretin (TTR 13.9 kDa, TTR fragment 12.9 kDa), beta-hemoglobin (Hb, 15.9 kDa), apolipoprotein AI (ApoAI, 28 kDa) and transferrin (TF, 79 kDa). Western and/or ELISA methods confirmed the differential expression of TTR, Hb, and TF, and multivariate analyses resulted in improving the detection of early stage ovarian tumors (low malignant potential and malignant; receiver operating characteristic, ROC 0.933) as compared to cancer antigen CA125 alone (ROC 0.833). Interestingly, when CA125 was included with our markers in the multivariate analysis, the ROC increased to 0.959. Furthermore, multivariate analysis with only the mucinous subtype of early stage ovarian tumors, showed our markers to greatly improve the detection of disease (ROC 0.959) as compared to CA125 alone (ROC 0.613). Interestingly, the combination of CA125 with our markers did not seem to further improve the detection of mucinous tumors (ROC 0.955). We conclude that TTR, Hb, ApoAI and TF, when combined with CA125 should significantly improve the detection of early stage ovarian cancer.

Heat-shock protein 27: a potential biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and ranks second in China. The prognosis of HCC remains dismal mainly because of its late diagnosis, especially in patients with coexisting chronic liver diseases. To identify serum biomarkers for HCC, sera from 20 healthy volunteers, 20 hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patients and 20 HCC patients were selected for screening study and same number of sera into the same three groups were used for validation study. A strategy including sonication, albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) depletion and desalting was optimized for screening differentially expressed proteins of low abundance in serum. By 2-DE image analysis and MALDI-TOF-MS/MS identification, eight proteins including heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alpha-1 antitrypsin, clusterin, caeruloplasmin, haptoglobin alpha2 chain, tranferrin and transthyretin were found significantly changed among the healthy, HBV and HCC groups. Further validation study by Western blot showed the detection of HSP27 in 90% HCC sera and two HBV sera, but in none of normal sera. Thus, 2-DE based serum proteome analysis can be useful in the screening of serum biomarkers for HCC and HSP27 could aid in the diagnosis of HCC though further validation is needed.

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4568-80.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The industrial use of uranium and particularly of depleted uranium, has pinpointed the need to review its chemical impact on human health. A proteomic approach was used to evaluate the response of a human lung cell line (A549) to uranium. We established the first 2-D reference map of the A549 cell line, identifying 87 spots corresponding to 81 major proteins. Uranium treatment triggered differential expression of 18 spots, of which 14 corresponded to fragments of cytokeratin 8 (CK8) and cytokeratin (CK18) and 1 to peroxiredoxin 1. We probed several hypotheses regarding CK cleavage, and observed that it did not result from caspase or calpain activity. Furthermore, we showed that the fragments are recognised by an anti-ubiquitin antibody (KM691). These results suggest a regulatory pathway involving CK ubiquitinylation or dysfunction in the proteasome-ubiquitin system in response to uranium exposure in human lung cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) can differentiate into endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which participate in vascular angiogenesis. In this study, we differentiated mouse ES cells into Sca-1(+) cells, which have the potential to serve as vascular progenitor cells, and mapped their proteome by 2-DE using a pH 3-10 non-linear gradient and 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. A subset of 300 protein spots was analysed and mapped, with 241 protein spots being identified by their PMF using MALDI-TOF MS or by partial amino acid sequencing using MS/MS. Our protein map is the first of Sca-1(+) progenitor cells and will facilitate the identification of proteins differentially expressed during stem cell differentiation. The proteome of adult arterial SMCs is described in an accompanying paper (in this issue, DOI 10.1002/pmic.200402045). All data are made accessible on our website http://www.vascular-proteomics.com.

<ABSTRACT>
In an accompanying study (in this issue, DOI 10.1002/pmic.200402044), we have characterised the proteome of Sca-1(+) progenitor cells, which may function as precursors of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In the present study, we have analysed and mapped protein expression in aortic SMCs of mice, using 2-DE, MALDI-TOF MS and MS/MS. The 2-D system comprised a non-linear immobilised pH 3-10 gradient in the first dimension (separating proteins with pI values of pH 3-10), and 12%T SDS-PAGE in the second dimension (separating proteins in the range 15,000-150,000 Da). Of the 2400 spots visualised, a subset of 267 protein spots was analysed, with 235 protein spots being identified corresponding to 154 unique proteins. The data presented here are the first map of aortic SMCs and the most extensive analysis of SMC proteins published so far. This valuable tool should provide a basis for comparative studies of protein expression in vascular smooth muscle of transgenic mice and is available on our website hhtp://www.vascular-proteomics.com.

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is a complex mixture of proteins, which represents a unique clinically useful sampling of the lower respiratory tract. Many proteomic technologies can be used to characterize complex biological mixtures; however, it is not yet clear which technology(s) provide more information regarding the number of proteins identified and sequence coverage. In this study, we initially compared two common proteomic approaches, 2-D LC microESI MS/MS and 1-DE followed by gel slice digestion, peptide extraction and peptide identification by MS in characterization of the mouse BALF proteome; secondly, we identified 297 unique proteins from the mouse BALF proteome, greatly expanded the BALF proteome by about threefold regardless of species.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) is responsible for the metabolism of acetaldehyde and other toxic lipid aldehydes. Despite many reports about the inhibition of ALDH2 by toxic chemicals, it is unknown whether nitric oxide (NO) can alter the ALDH2 activity in intact cells or in vivo animals. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of NO on ALDH2 activity in H4IIE-C3 rat hepatoma cells. NO donors such as S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, and 3-morpholinosydnonimine significantly increased the nitrite concentration while they inhibited the ALDH2 activity. Addition of GSH-ethylester (GSH-EE) completely blocked the GSNO-mediated ALDH2 inhibition and increased nitrite concentration. To directly demonstrate the NO-mediated S-nitrosylation and inactivation, ALDH2 was immunopurified from control or GSNO-treated cells and subjected to immunoblot analysis. The anti-nitrosocysteine antibody recognized the immunopurified ALDH2 only from the GSNO-treated samples. All these results indicate that S-nitrosylation of ALDH2 in intact cells leads to reversible inhibition of ALDH2 activity.

<ABSTRACT>
The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis was investigated in cell-free extracts of neurones and astrocytes at various stages of maturation. Neuronal extracts were activated 65-fold after 3 days, 9-fold after 7 days, and were not activated after 10 days in culture. In contrast, astrocyte extracts were activated to a similar extent at all stages, up to 60 days in culture. The co-incubation of neuronal and astrocyte extracts followed by addition of cytochrome c/2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate led to a 40-fold activation, suggesting that the development-associated neuronal shift does not involve the appearance of a dominant inhibitor, but rather downregulation of some key component(s) involved in caspase activation.

<ABSTRACT>
Two beta-carotene ketolases, CrtW and CrtO, are widely distributed in bacteria, although they show no significant sequence homology with each other. The cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 was found to have two homologous genes. In the crtW deleted mutant, myxol 2'-fucoside was present, but ketomyxol 2'-fucoside was absent. In the crtO deleted mutant, beta-carotene was accumulated, and the amount of echinenone was decreased. Therefore, CrtW catalyzed myxol 2'-fucoside to ketomyxol 2'-fucoside, and CrtO catalyzed beta-carotene to echinenone. This cyanobacterium was the first species found to have both enzymes, which functioned in two distinct biosynthetic pathways.

In plants and in some animals, the effects of post-transcriptional RNA silencing can extend beyond its sites of initiation, owing to the movement of signal molecules. Although the mechanisms and channels involved are different, plant and animal silencing signals must have RNA components that account for the nucleotide sequence-specificity of their effects. Studies carried out in plants and Caenorhabditis elegans have revealed that non-cell autonomous silencing is operated through specialized, remarkably sophisticated pathways and serves important biological functions, including antiviral immunity and, perhaps, developmental patterning. Recent intriguing observations suggest that systemic RNA silencing pathways may also exist in higher vertebrates.

The "resurrection method" for modification of specific proteins in higher

<ABSTRACT>
We describe a new method designated "the resurrection method" by which a modified protein is expressed in higher plants in place of the original protein. The modified gene constructed by introducing synonymous codon substitutions throughout the original gene to prevent the sequence-specific degradation of its mRNA during RNA silencing is expressed while the expression of the original gene is suppressed. Here, we report the successful alteration of the biochemical properties of green fluorescent protein expressed in transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana, suggesting that this method could be useful for gene control in living plants.

SNARE-mediated membrane traffic modulates RhoA-regulated focal adhesion
formation.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 7;579(27):6169-78. Epub 2005 Oct 13.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In the present study, we examined the role of soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-mediated membrane traffic in the formation of focal adhesions during cell spreading. CHO-K1 cells expressing a dominant-negative form of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (E329Q-NSF) were unable to spread as well as control cells and they formed focal adhesions (FAs) that were larger than those in control cells. FA formation was impaired in cells transfected with a dominant-negative form of RhoA, but, significantly, not in cells simultaneously expressing dominant-negative NSF. Treatment of E329Q-NSF-expressing cells with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 did inhibit FA formation. The results are consistent with a model of cell adhesion in which SNARE-mediated membrane traffic is required for both the elaboration of lamellipodia and the modulation of biochemical signals that control RhoA-mediated FA assembly.

Cell integrity signaling activation in response to hyperosmotic shock in
yeast.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 7;579(27):6186-90. Epub 2005 Oct 13.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Current progress highlights the role of the yeast cell wall as a highly dynamic structure that responds to many environmental stresses. Here, we show that hyperosmotic shock transiently activates the PKC signaling pathway, a response that requires previous activation of the HOG pathway. Phosphorylation of Slt2p under such conditions is related to changes in the glycerol turnover and is mostly Mid2p dependent, suggesting that changes in cell turgor, mediated by intracellular accumulation of glycerol, are sensed by PKC sensors to promote the cell integrity response. These observations, together with previous results, suggest that yeast cells respond to changes in cellular turgor by remodeling their cell walls.

Low and high molecular weight poly(L-lysine)s/poly(L-lysine)-DNA complexes
initiate mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis differently.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 7;579(27):6191-8. Epub 2005 Oct 13.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Poly(L-lysine)s, PLLs, are commonly used for DNA compaction and cell transfection. We report that, although PLLs of low (2.9 kDa), L-PLL, and high (27.4 kDa), H-PLL, Mw in free form and DNA-complexed cannot only cause rapid plasma membrane damage in human cell lines, phosphatidylserine "scrambling" and loss of membrane integrity, but later (24 h) initiate stress-induced cell death via mitochondrial permeabilization without the involvement of processed caspase-2. Mitochondrially mediated apoptosis was confirmed by detection of cytochrome c (Cyt c) release, activation of caspases-9 and -3, and subsequent changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Plasma membrane damage and apoptosis were most prominent with H-PLL. Cytoplasmic level of Cyt c was more elevated following H-PLL treatment, but unlike L-PLL case, inhibition of Bax channel-forming activity reduced the extent of Cyt c release from mitochondria by half. Inhibition of Bax channel-forming activity had no modulatory effect on L-PLL-mediated Cyt c release. Further, functional studies of isolated mitochondria indicate that H-PLL, but not L-PLL, can directly induce Cyt c release, membrane depolarization, and a progressive decline in the rate of uncoupled respiration. Combined, our data suggest that H-PLL and L-PLL are capable of initiating mitochondrially mediated apoptosis differently. The observed PLL-mediated late-phase apoptosis may provide an explanation for previously reported transient gene expression associated with PLL-based transfection vectors. The importance of our data in relation to design of novel and safer cationic non-viral vectors for human gene therapy is discussed.

Functional zinc finger/sleeping beauty transposase chimeras exhibit
attenuated overproduction inhibition.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 7;579(27):6205-9. Epub 2005 Oct 17.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The sleeping beauty (SB) transposon system has potential utility in gene transfer applications but lacks specificity for genomic integration and exhibits overproduction inhibition which limits in vivo activity. Targeting transposition may be possible by coupling a specific DNA binding domain to the SB transposase, but it is not known if this strategy will preserve or disrupt activity of the system. We engineered and tested chimeric SB transposases with two different human zinc finger DNA binding domain elements, Sp1 and zinc finger 202 (ZNF202). Addition of Sp1 to the C-terminus abolished transposase activity whereas N-terminal addition of either Sp1 or ZNF202 did not. Transposition activity exhibited by N-terminal chimeras was increased to levels similar to native SB through the use of a hyperactive transposase (SB12) and activating transposon mutations. Importantly, addition of DNA binding domains to the transposase N-terminus resulted in attenuation of overproduction inhibition, a major limitation of this system. These findings suggest that SB transposase chimeras may have specific advantages over the native enzyme.

<ABSTRACT>
Prolidases are dipeptidases specific for cleavage of Xaa-Pro dipeptides. Pyrococcus furiosus prolidase is a homodimer having one Co-bound dinuclear metal cluster per monomer with one tightly bound Co(II) site and the other loosely bound (Kd 0.24 mM). To identify which Co site is tight-binding and which is loose-binding, site-directed mutagenesis was used to modify amino acid residues that participate in binding the Co1 (E-313 and H-284), the Co2 site (D-209) or the bidentate ligand (E-327). Metal-content, enzyme activity and CD-spectra analyses of D209A-, H284L-, and E327L-prolidase mutants show that Co1 is the tight-binding and Co2 the loose-binding metal center.

Apo2L/TRAIL is an indirect mediator of apoptosis induced by

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 7;579(27):6217-22. Epub 2005 Oct 17.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is currently used for the therapy of multiple myeloma (MM) though it is only effective in some patients. IFN-alpha induces apoptosis in some MM cell lines and it has been proposed to occur through an autocrine loop involving Apo2L/TRAIL. We have analysed the sensitivity to IFN-alpha and Apo2L/TRAIL of five MM cell lines and found no correlation between the apoptosis inducing ability of both cytokines. IFN-alpha-induced apoptosis in MM cells was not prevented by a caspase-8 selective inhibitor (Z-IETD-fmk) or blocking Apo2L/TRAIL. However, human monocytes treated with IFN-alpha release bioactive Apo2L/TRAIL to culture media which was cytotoxic for MM cells resistant to IFN-alpha. We propose that Apo2L/TRAIL released from IFN-alpha-stimulated blood monocytes would be a major mediator of the anti-myeloma effect of IFN-alpha in vivo.

Malaria parasite-infected erythrocytes inhibit glucose utilization in

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite depend on anaerobic glycolysis for energy. Using [2-13C]glucose and nuclear magnetic resonance, the glucose utilization rate and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) level produced in normal RBCs and Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood cell populations (IRBCs, with <4% parasite infected red cells), were measured. The glucose flux in IRBCs was several-folds greater, was proportional to parasitemia, and maximal at trophozoite stage. The 2,3-DPG levels were disproportionately lower in IRBCs, indicating a downregulation of 2,3-DPG flux in non-parasitized RBCs. This may be due to lowered pH leading to selective differential inhibition of the regulatory glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase. This downregulation of the glucose utilization rate in the majority (>96%) of uninfected RBCs in an IRBC population may have physiological implications in malaria patients.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The male gametophyte of Arabidopsis is a three-celled pollen grain that is thought to contain almost all the mRNAs needed for germination and rapid pollen tube growth. We generated a reference map of the Arabidopsis mature pollen proteome by using multiple protein extraction techniques followed by 2-DE and ESI-MS/MS. We identified 135 distinct proteins from a total of 179 protein spots. We found that half of the identified proteins are involved in metabolism (20%), energy generation (17%), or cell structure (12%); these percentages are similar to those determined for the pollen transcriptome and this similarity is consistent with the idea that in addition to the mRNAs, the mature pollen grain contains proteins necessary for germination and rapid pollen tube growth. We identified ten proteins of unknown function, three of which are flower- or pollen-specific, and we identified nine proteins whose RNAs were absent from the transcriptome, seven of which are involved in metabolism, energy generation, or cell wall structure. Our work complements and extends recent analyses of the pollen transcriptome.

<ABSTRACT>
T helper cells (Th) are divided into Th1 and Th2 subsets based upon their cytokine profiles and function. Naive Th cells differentiate into Th1 and Th2 subsets depending on the antigens, costimulatory molecules, and cytokines they encounter. Cytokine interleukin (IL)-12 enhances the generation of Th1 lymphocytes and inhibits the production of Th2 subset. Many genes involved in Th cell differentiation have already been identified at transcriptomic level in microarray studies. In this study, isotope coded affinity tag labeling combined with chromatographic techniques and tandem mass spectrometry was used to find IL-12 regulated proteins in the microsomal fraction of Th cells. A total of 380 and 275 proteins were initially identified and quantitated in two experiments. After the high-confidence protein identifications were restricted to those where at least two different peptides were identified per protein, and these confirmed by manual inspection of the tandem mass spectra, 147 proteins remained. Of these high-confidence protein identifications 41 had at least 1.5-fold change in expression between IL-12 treated and nontreated cells. Among the differentially regulated proteins were galectin-1 (gal-1) and CD7, and their down-regulation was further corroborated with Western blotting and flow cytometry, respectively. Gal-1 and CD7 are known to interact with each other, and regulate immunity through influencing apoptosis and cytokine production. Our data indicate that IL-12 down-regulates the expression of both gal-1 and CD7 in the microsomal fraction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cord blood CD4(+) cells. The down-regulation of these proteins is likely to have a role in specific Th cell selection and cytokine environment creation.

A reference database of the major soluble proteins of the primary root of the maize inbred line B73 was generated 5 days after germination (DAG) using a combination of 2-DE and MALDI-TOF MS. A total of 302 protein spots were detected with CBB in a pH 4-7 range and 81 proteins representing 74 distinct Genbank accessions were identified. Only 28% of the major proteins identified in 5 DAG primary roots were identified in similarly analyzed 9 DAG primary roots documenting remarkable changes in the accumulation of abundant soluble proteins early in primary root development.

<ABSTRACT>
The differentially expressed proteins in pollen tubes indicate their specific roles in this stage of male gametophyte development. To isolate these proteins, 2-DE was done using ungerminated pollen and 2-day-old pollen tubes of Pinus strobus. Results show that 645 and 647 protein spots were clearly resolved from pollen grains and pollen tubes, respectively. Thirty-eight protein spots were expressed only in pollen tubes, while 19 increased in intensity. MALDI-TOF MS was used to generate tryptic peptide masses that were submitted to Mascot for identification. Of the differentially expressed proteins, 12% matched with hypothetical proteins, 33% did not hit any protein, and for the 55%, a putative function was assigned based on similarity of sequences with previously characterized proteins. Therefore, pollen tube development can be characterized by the cellular activities that involve metabolism, stress/defense response, gene regulation, signal transduction, and cell wall formation. This study expands our understanding of the changes in protein expression associated with pollen tube development and provides insights into the molecular programs that separate the development of the pollen tubes from pollen grains. This is the first report that describes a global analysis of differentially expressed proteins from the pollen tube of any seed plant.

<ABSTRACT>
The folding, transport and modification of recombinant proteins in the constitutive secretory pathway of eukaryotic cell expression systems are reported to be a bottleneck in their production. We have utilised a proteomic approach to investigate the processes catalysed by proteins constituting the secretory pathway to further our understanding of those processes involved in high-level antibody secretion. We used GS-NS0 cell populations differing in qmAb to prepare enriched microsome fractions from each cell population at mid-exponential growth phase. These were analysed by 2-D PAGE to characterise the microsome protein component and test the hypothesis that bottlenecks in recombinant protein synthesis exist in these compartments, which are alleviated in high producers by the up-regulation of key secretory pathway proteins. Proteins whose abundance changed in a statistically significant manner with increasing qmAb were involved in a range of cellular functions: energy metabolism, mAb folding/assembly, cytoskeletal organisation and protein turnover. Amongst these were BiP and PDI, chaperones resident in the ER that interact with nascent immunoglobulins during their folding/assembly. However, our results suggest that there are diverse mechanisms by which these cells achieve qmAb. The results imply that cell-engineering strategies for improving qmAb should target proteins associated with altered functional phenotype identified in this study.

Proteomic analysis of organ-specific post-translational lysine-acetylation

mouse monoclonal antibodies.

Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4653-64.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Post-translational lysine-acetylation and -methylation are two major PTMs of lysine residues in proteins. Recently, we established pan-reactive anti-acetyllysine mouse mAbs, which can bind to Nepsilon-acetylated lysine residues in various contexts of amino acid sequences. In the present study, we established pan-reactive anti-methyllysine mouse mAbs comparable to the anti-acetyllysine ones. By using these anti-acetyllysine and -methyllysine antibodies, we found that the pattern of lysine-acetylated and -methylated proteins in mouse organs showed extreme variation from organ to organ. We selected brain and skeletal muscle as model cases to be further analyzed by 2-DE followed by Western blotting. In brain, alpha-tubulin at its basal level was found to be extremely acetylated; and alpha-enolase was shown to be a newly recognized possibly acetylated protein. NF-L protein, Hsc70, alpha-tubulin fragments, beta-actin, and brain-type creatine kinase were identified as putative lysine-methylated proteins in mouse brain. In skeletal muscle, lysine-methylation of alpha-actin and both lysine-acetylation and -methylation of muscle-type creatine kinase were found as novel putative lysine-modified proteins. The approach presented here might be useful to find novel disease markers and/or drug target molecules that would not be noticed by use of the traditional proteomic approach only.

haemolytica virulence factor expression.

Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4852-63.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Here we identify, using nonelectrophoretic proteomics, effects of subminimum inhibitory concentrations (subMIC) of two antibiotic preparations, chlortetracycline (CTC), and chlortetracycline-sulfamethazine (CTC + SMZ), on protein expression in the bovine respiratory pathogen Mannheimia haemolytica. The M. haemolytica genome is currently in draft form, and annotation is incomplete. Relying on the principle of gene sequence conservation across species, we used annotated genomes from closely related species to identify, confirm, and functionally annotate 495 M. haemolytica proteins. To conduct quantitative comparative proteomics, we developed a protein quantitation method based on the cross correlation function of the SEQUEST algorithm. When M. haemolytica was cultivated in the presence of 1/4 MIC of CTC and CTC + SMZ, expression of proteins involved in energy production, nucleotide metabolism, translation, and the bacterial stress response (chaperones) were affected. The most notable subMIC effect was a significant decrease in the expression of leukotoxin A, which is an important M. haemolytica virulence factor. Reduction in leukotoxin expression could be one of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the efficacy of these antibiotics against bovine respiratory disease.

Identification of substrates of the Listeria monocytogenes sortases A and

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4808-17.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Sortases are enzymes that anchor surface proteins to the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria by cleaving a sorting motif located in the C-terminus of the protein substrate. The best-characterized motif is LPXTG, which is cleaved between the T and G residues. In this study, a non-gel proteomic approach was used to identify surface proteins recognized by the two sortases of Listeria monocytogenes, SrtA and SrtB. Material containing peptidoglycan and strongly associated proteins was purified from sortase-defective mutants, digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptide mixture analysed by two-dimensional nano-liquid chromatography coupled to ion-trap mass spectrometry. Unlike enzymes involved in peptidoglycan metabolism, other surface proteins displayed uneven distribution in the mutants. A total of 13 LPXTG-containing proteins were identified exclusively in strains having a functional SrtA. In contrast, two surface proteins, Lmo2185 and Lmo2186, were identified only when SrtB was active. The analysis of the peptides identified in these proteins suggests that SrtB of L. monocytogenes may recognize two different sorting motifs, NXZTN and NPKXZ. Taken together, these data demonstrate that non-gel proteomics is a powerful technique to rapidly identify sortase substrates and to gain insights on potential sorting motifs.

<ABSTRACT>
The search for novel molecular markers of tumor invasion is vital if strategies are to become more effective in the diagnostic and prognostic management of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Up to 50% of tumors detected at stage 1 (pT1) progress to a higher grade even after endoscopic surgical resection, and there are currently no protein markers of this aggressive, invasive phenotype. We have combined SELDI-TOF-MS, ClinProt magnetic bead enrichment, Nano-LC-ESI-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry and immunohistochemical analysis to the study of 12 invasive bladder cancer tissue biopsies paired with normal bladder tissue samples obtained from the same patients for the definition and identification of proteins up-regulated in the tumors. We report the inflammation-associated calcium binding protein S100A8 (MRP-8, calgranulin A) to be highly expressed in tumor cells in contrast to normal urothelium in 50% of the samples, as well as two unidentified protein markers at 5.75 and 6.89 kDa that were differentially detected in 9/12 and 10/12 tumor samples, respectively. These new markers, when fully characterized, may contribute to new target proteins for the prediction of aggressive, invasive bladder tumors.

<ABSTRACT>
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common neoplasm with more than 500 000 new cases diagnosed yearly. Although major risk factors of HCC are currently known, the identification of biological targets leading to an early diagnosis of the disease is considered one of the priorities of clinical hepatology. In this work we have used a proteomic approach to identify markers of hepatocarcinogenesis in the serum of a knockout mice deficient in hepatic AdoMet synthesis (MAT1A(-/-)), as well as in patients with HCC. Three isoforms of apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) with different pI were identified in murine serum. Isoform 1 is up-regulated in the serum of MAT1A(-/-) mice much earlier than any histological manifestation of liver disease. Further characterization of the differential isoform by electrospray MS/MS revealed specific oxidation of methionine 85 and 216 to methionine sulfoxide while the sequence of the analogous peptides on isoforms 2 and 3 showed the nonoxidized methionine residues. Enrichment of an acidic isoform of Apo A-I was also assessed in the serum of hepatitis B virus patients who developed HCC. Specific oxidation of methionine 112 to methionine sulfoxide and tryptophans 50 and 108 to formylkinurenine were identified selectively in the up-regulated isoform. Although it is not clear at present whether the occurrence of these modifications has a causal role or simply reflects secondary epiphenomena, this selectively oxidized Apo A-I isoform may be considered as a pathological hallmark that may help to the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HCC.

<ABSTRACT>
Studying endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms induced by preconditioning may provide drug leads to reduce ischemic neuronal death. In this study, we used 2-DE to examine protein expression following cycloheximide, heat stress, and MK801 preconditioning in rat cortical neuronal cultures. Of 150 differentially expressed protein spots selected for identification the protein or tentative protein(s) were identified in 84 cases, representing 50 different proteins. Different protein spots representing the same protein or closely related protein(s) occurred for 21 of the identified proteins and are likely to represent PTMs or proteolytic fragments of the protein. Six protein spots (actin, elongation factor 1-alpha 1, peptidyl-prolyl cis-transisomerase A, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, stathmin, tropomyosin) were differentially expressed in all three preconditioning treatments. Twenty-seven protein spots were differentially expressed in two preconditioning treatments, while 51 spots were differentially expressed in one treatment. Three proteins heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2/B1, mitochondrial stress-70 protein, and tropomyosin were detected in control neuronal cultures, but not following one or more preconditioning treatments, while a posttranslational modified form of the voltage dependent anion channel 1 was only detected following cycloheximide preconditioning. In summary, this study has revealed multiple protein changes potentially involved in neuroprotective and neurodamaging pathways, which require further characterization.

<ABSTRACT>
Imaging the proteome is a term that is used in many different contexts. The term implies that the entire cohort of proteins and their modifications are visualized. This unfortunately is not the case. In this mini-review, a concise overview is provided on different imaging technologies that are currently used to investigate the structure, function and dynamics of proteins and their organization. These techniques have been selected for review based on the unique insights they provide in subsets of the proteome. These techniques have been illustrated with practical examples of their merits. Mass spectrometry-based imaging technologies are playing a key role in proteome research and have been reviewed in more detail. They hold the promise of detailed molecular insight in the spatial organization of living system.

<ABSTRACT>
We have investigated the cytoprotective effect of eckol, which was isolated from Ecklonia cava, against oxidative stress induced cell damage in Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (V79-4) cells. Eckol was found to scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), hydroxy radical, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and thus prevented lipid peroxidation. As a result, eckol reduced H(2)O(2) induced cell death in V79-4 cells. In addition, eckol inhibited cell damage induced by serum starvation and radiation by scavenging ROS. Eckol was found to increase the activity of catalase and its protein expression. Further, molecular mechanistic study revealed that eckol increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and activity of nuclear factor kappa B. Taken together, the results suggest that eckol protects V79-4 cells against oxidative damage by enhancing the cellular antioxidant activity and modulating cellular signal pathway.

ET-18-O-CH3-induced apoptosis is causally linked to COX-2 upregulation in
H-ras transformed human breast epithelial cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Abnormally elevated expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been frequently observed in transformed or malignant cells, and certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with COX-2 inhibitory activity exert anti-neoplastic or chemopreventive effects. Contrary to this notion, we have found that a novel alkylphospholipid type antitumor agent ET-18-O-CH3 (1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine) induces COX-2 expression in H-ras transformed human breast epithelial cells (MCF10A-ras) while it causes apoptosis at the same concentration range. The addition of a selective COX-2 inhibitor SC-58635 and COX-2 gene knock down with the siRNA blocked ET-18-O-CH3-induced apoptosis, suggesting that COX-2 induction by this drug is causally linked to its apoptosis inducing activity. ET-18-O-CH3 enhanced the transcriptional activities of cyclic AMP response element which is a key regulator of COX-2 expression. 15-Deoxy-Delta(12,14) prostaglandin J2 is, an endogenous ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), has been known to possess proapoptotic potential in diverse cell types. ET-18-O-CH3 treatment resulted in elevated release of 15d-PGJ2 and DNA binding and transcriptional activity of PPARgamma. Based on these findings, it is likely that ET-18-O-CH3 induces COX-2 expression and production of 15d-PGJ2 which may mediate the ET-18-O-CH3-induced apoptosis in MCF10A-ras cells.

Desumoylation of homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) through
the cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of the SUMO-specific protease SENP1.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 7;579(27):6272-8. Epub 2005 Oct 19.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The modification of homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) by small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1) plays an important role in its targeting into the promyelocytic leukemia body, as well as in its differential interaction with binding partner, but the desumoylation of HIPK2 by SUMO-specific proteases is largely unknown. In this study, we show that HIPK2 is a desumoylation target for the SUMO-specific protease SENP1 that shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Mutation analyses reveal that SENP1 contains the nuclear export sequence (NES) within the extreme carboxyl-terminal region, and SENP1 is exported to the cytoplasm in a NES-dependent manner. Sumoylated HIPK2 are deconjugated by SENP1 both in vitro and in cultured cells, and the desumoylation is enhanced either by the forced translocation of SENP1 into the nucleus or by the SENP1 NES mutant. Concomitantly, desumoylation induces dissociation of HIPK2 from nuclear bodies. These results demonstrate that HIPK2 is a target for SENP1 desumoylation, and suggest that the desumoylation of HIPK2 may be regulated by the cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of SENP1.

Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing glyoxalase enzymes resist an
increase in methylglyoxal and maintain higher reduced glutathione levels
under salinity stress.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 7;579(27):6265-71. Epub 2005 Oct 17.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The mechanism behind enhanced salt tolerance conferred by the overexpression of glyoxalase pathway enzymes was studied in transgenic vis-a-vis wild-type (WT) plants. We have recently documented that salinity stress induces higher level accumulation of methylglyoxal (MG), a potent cytotoxin and primary substrate for glyoxalase pathway, in various plant species [Yadav, S.K., Singla-Pareek, S.L., Ray, M., Reddy, M.K. and Sopory, S.K. (2005) MG levels in plants under salinity stress are dependent on glyoxalase I and glutathione. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 337, 61-67]. The transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing glyoxalase pathway enzymes, resist an increase in the level of MG that increased to over 70% in WT plants under salinity stress. These plants showed enhanced basal activity of various glutathione related antioxidative enzymes that increased further upon salinity stress. These plants suffered minimal salinity stress induced oxidative damage measured in terms of the lipid peroxidation. The reduced glutathione (GSH) content was high in these transgenic plants and also maintained a higher reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH:GSSG) ratio under salinity. Manipulation of glutathione ratio by exogenous application of GSSG retarded the growth of non-transgenic plants whereas transgenic plants sustained their growth. These results suggest that resisting an increase in MG together with maintaining higher reduced glutathione levels can be efficiently achieved by the overexpression of glyoxalase pathway enzymes towards developing salinity stress tolerant plants.

B7-H1 (CD274) inhibits the development of herpetic stromal keratitis
(HSK).
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 7;579(27):6259-64. Epub 2005 Oct 19.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The co-signaling molecule B7-H1 (CD274) functions as both a co-inhibitor through programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and a co-stimulator via an as-yet-unidentified receptor on T cells. We investigated the physiological role of endogenous B7-H1 in the pathogenesis of herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Following HSV-1 infection of the cornea of mice, B7-H1 expression was up-regulated in the CD11b+ macrophage population in the draining lymph nodes (dLN) and in the inflamed cornea. In addition, HSV-1 infection significantly increased PD-1 expression on CD4+ T cells in the dLN and inflamed cornea. The administration of antagonistic B7-H1 monoclonal antibody resulted in the proliferation of HSV-specific CD4+ T cells that secreted interferon (INF)-gamma, and inhibited the apoptosis of HSV-specific CD4+ T cells, which exaggerated HSK. These results strongly suggest that the B7-H1 may be involved in suppression of the development of HSK.

<ABSTRACT>
In this study, we investigated the influence of inorganic lead (Pb(II)), an environmental pollutant having nephrotoxic action, on the focal adhesion (FA) organization of a rat kidney epithelial cell line (NRK-52E). In particular, we evaluated the effects of the metal on the recruitment of paxillin, focal adhesion kinase, vinculin and cytoskeleton proteins at the FAs complexes. We provided evidences that, in proliferating NRK-52E cell cultures, low concentrations of Pb(II) affect the cell adhesive ability and stimulate the disassembly of FAs, thus inhibiting the integrin-activated signalling. These effects appeared to be strictly associated to the Pb-induced arrest of cell cycle at G0/G1 phase also proved in this cell line.

<ABSTRACT>
The mushroom Agrocybe aegerita secretes a peroxidase (AaP) that catalyzes halogenations and hydroxylations. Phenol was brominated to 2- and 4-bromophenol (ratio 1:4) and chlorinated to a lesser extent to 2-chlorophenol. The purified enzyme was found to oxidize toluene via benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde into benzoic acid. A second fraction of toluene was hydroxylated to give p-cresol as well as o-cresol and methyl-p-benzoquinone. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of purified AaP showed high similarity to a resting state cytochrome P450 with the Soret band at 420 nm and additional maxima at 278, 358, 541 and 571 nm; the AaP CO-complex had a distinct absorption maximum at 445 nm that is characteristic for heme-thiolate proteins. AaP regioselectively hydroxylated naphthalene to 1-naphthol and traces of 2-naphthol (ratio 36:1). H2O2 was necessarily required for AaP function and hence the hydroxylations catalyzed by AaP can be designated as peroxygenation and the enzyme as an extracellular peroxygenase.

Transgenic mice expressing bovine PrP with a four extra repeat octapeptide
insert mutation show a spontaneous, non-transmissible, neurodegenerative

<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 7;579(27):6237-46. Epub 2005 Oct 19.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Transgenic (Tg) mice carrying four extra octapeptide repeats (OR) in the bovine PrP gene (10OR instead of 6) have been generated. In these mice, neuropathological changes were observed depending upon the level of transgene expression. These changes primarily involved a slowly advancing neurological disorder, characterized clinically by ataxia, and neuropathologically, by vacuolization in different brain areas, gliosis, and loss of cerebellar granule cells. Accumulation of insoluble bovine 10OR-PrP (bo10OR-PrP) was observed depending on the level of expression but no infectivity was found associated with this insoluble form. We also compared the behavior of bo6OR-PrP and bo10OR-PrP Tg mouse lines in response to BSE infection. BSE-inoculated bo10ORTg mice showed an altered course of BSE infection, reflected by reduced incubation times when compared to bo6ORTg mice expressing similar levels of the wild type 6OR-PrP. In BSE-inoculated mice, it was possible to detect PrP(res) in 100% of the animals. While insoluble bo10OR-PrP from non-inoculated bo10ORTg mice was non-infectious, brain homogenates from BSE-inoculated bo10ORTg mice were highly infectious in all the Tg mouse lines tested. This Tg mouse model constitutes a new way of understanding the pathobiology of bovine transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. Its potential applications include the assessment of new therapies against prion diseases.

Nitric oxide induces tau hyperphosphorylation via glycogen synthase

FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 7;579(27):6230-6. Epub 2005 Oct 17.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Nitric oxide is associated with neurofibrillary tangle, which is composed mainly of hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of nitric oxide in tau hyperphosphorylation is unclear. Here we show that nitric oxide produced by sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a recognized donor of nitric oxide, induces tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser396/404 and Ser262 in HEK293/tau441 cells with a simultaneous activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). Pretreatment of the cells with 10 mM lithium chloride (LiCl), an inhibitor of GSK-3, 1 h before SNP administration inhibits GSK-3beta activation and prevents tau from hyperphosphorylation. This is the first direct evidence demonstrating that nitric oxide induces AD-like tau hyperphosphorylation in vitro, and GSK-3beta activation is partially responsible for the nitric oxide-induced tau hyperphosphorylation. It is suggested that nitric oxide may be an upstream element of tau abnormal hyperphosphorylation in AD.

<ABSTRACT>
Silencing of the transcriptional repressor REST is required for terminal differentiation of neuronal and beta-cells. In this study, we hypothesized that REST expression is controlled by hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES-1), a transcriptional repressor that plays an important role in brain and pancreas development. We identified several N elements (CTNGTG) within the promoter of REST and confirmed that HES-1 associates with the endogenous promoter of REST. Moreover, using a cells model that overexpress HES-1 and a combination of experimental approaches, we demonstrated that HES-1 reduces endogenous REST expression. Taken together, these results indicate that HES-1 is an upstream negative regulator of REST expression.

<ABSTRACT>
In colorectal cancer tight junction molecular and morphological alterations are poorly understood. In this study, adenocarcinoma tissues and their paired normal mucosa (n = 12) were analyzed for tight junction alterations molecular. The expression of claudin-1, -3 and -4 was upregulated 5.7-, 1.5- and 2.4-fold, respectively, in colorectal tumor tissues in comparison to the normal ones. Although tight junction remains in the cancerous epithelium, its barrier function was altered. Despite claudins overexpression, paracellular permeability to ruthenium red was increased and a significant disorganization of tight junction strands was observed in freeze fracture replicas. Whereas the functional significance of claudin overexpression in colorectal cancer is unclear, these proteins can become potential markers and targets in colorectal cancer.

<ABSTRACT>
Comparative proteomic analysis was used to search for characteristic alterations in the sera of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who had undergone curative radiofrequency ablation treatment. Serum samples collected from eight patients before and after treatment were subjected to 2-DE. Eighty-eight protein spots differentially expressed with the treatment were selected by clustering analysis, and the proteins were identified by MS based on MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis and public database searches. The statistical analysis suggested that four proteins decreased after treatment (pro-apolipoprotein, alpha2-HS glycoprotein, apolipoprotein A-IV precursor, and PRO1708/PRO2044, which is the carboxy terminal fragment of albumin) and that seven proteins were increased after treatment, including leucine-rich alpha2-glycoprotein and alpha1-antitrypsin. These data facilitate the identification of differentially expressed proteins that are involved in HCC carcinogenesis and provide candidate biomarkers for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

<ABSTRACT>
Recent advances in proteomics research underscore the increasing need for high-affinity monoclonal antibodies, which are still generated with lengthy, low-throughput antibody production techniques. Here we present a semi-automated, high-throughput method of hybridoma generation and identification. Monoclonal antibodies were raised to different targets in single batch runs of 6-10 wk using multiplexed immunisations, automated fusion and cell-culture, and a novel antigen-coated microarray-screening assay. In a large-scale experiment, where eight mice were immunized with ten antigens each, we generated monoclonal antibodies against 68 of the targets (85%), within 6 wk of the primary immunization.

<ABSTRACT>
Mass spectrometry is being used to find disease-related patterns in mixtures of proteins derived from biological fluids. Questions have been raised about the reproducibility and reliability of peak quantifications using this technology. We collected nipple aspirate fluid from breast cancer patients and healthy women, pooled them into a quality control sample, and produced 24 replicate SELDI spectra. We developed a novel algorithm to process the spectra, denoising with the undecimated discrete wavelet transform (UDWT), and evaluated it for consistency and reproducibility. UDWT efficiently decomposes spectra into noise and signal. The noise is consistent and uncorrelated. Baseline correction produces isolated peak clusters separated by flat regions. Our method reproducibly detects more peaks than the method implemented in Ciphergen software. After normalization and log transformation, the mean coefficient of variation of peak heights is 10.6%. Our method to process spectra provides improvements over existing methods. Denoising using the UDWT appears to be an important step toward obtaining results that are more accurate. It improves the reproducibility of quantifications and supplies tools for investigation of the variations in the technology more carefully. Further study will be required, because we do not have a gold standard providing an objective assessment of which peaks are present in the samples.

Global protein expression pattern of Bradyrhizobium japonicum bacteroids:
a prelude to functional proteomics.

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(16):4170-84.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
As a prelude to using functional proteomics towards understanding the process of symbiotic nitrogen fixation between the legume soybean and the soil bacteria Bradyrhizobium japonicum, we examined the total protein expression pattern of the nodule bacteria, often referred to as bacteroids. A partial proteome map was constructed by separating the total bacteroid proteins using high-resolution 2-DE. Of the several hundred protein spots analyzed using PMF, 180 spots were tentatively identified by searching the available database for B. japonicum, (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/index.html). The data showed that the bacteroid expressed a dominant and elaborate protein network for nitrogen and carbon metabolism, which is closely dependent on the plant supplied metabolites, and seems aptly supported by a selective group of bacteroid transporter proteins. However, they seem to lack a defined fatty acid and nucleic acid metabolism. Interestingly, the proteins related to protein synthesis, scaffolding and degradation were among the most predominant spots of the bacteroid proteome. In addition, several proteins, which showed fairly good expression, were identified to be involved with cellular detoxification, stress regulation and signaling communication components. This preliminary proteomic data matches very well with several biochemical and genetic reports, and clearly shows the inter-connection between several metabolic pathways that meet the needs of the bacteroid. It is expected that in the future this will allow us to develop testable hypotheses about the roles of several of these proteins in context to the metabolic pathway connections and metabolite fluxes.

<ABSTRACT>
Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension cultures have been used to investigate the effects of salinity and hyperosmotic stress on plant cellular proteins. We show that 200 mM NaCl and 400 mM sorbitol treatments induce extracellular medium acidification in Arabidopsis cell cultures, a typical response of plant cells to salt and hyperosmotic stress. Using (35)S-labelled amino acids, we demonstrated that NaCl causes a transient suppression of de novo protein synthesis, from which the cells recover within 4 h. Changes in the abundance of cellular proteins 6 h post NaCl and sorbitol treatments were analysed by 2-DE. Of a total of 2,949 protein spots detected on the gels, 266 showed significant changes in abundance across five independent experiments. Using MALDI-TOF MS, we identified 75 salt and sorbitol responsive spots. These fall into 10 functional categories that include H(+) transporting ATPases, signal transduction related proteins, transcription/translation related proteins, detoxifying enzymes, amino acid and purine biosynthesis related proteins, proteolytic enzymes, heat-shock proteins, carbohydrate metabolism-associated proteins and proteins with no known biological functions.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Phosphorylation of histone H2AX (termed gamma-H2AX) was recently identified as an early event after induction of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). We have previously shown that co-exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a wide-spread environmental carcinogen, and ultraviolet A (UVA), a major component of solar UV radiation, induced DSBs in mammalian cells. In the present study, we examined whether co-exposure to BaP and UVA generates gamma-H2AX in CHO-K1 cells. Single treatment with BaP (10(-9)-10(-7)M) or UVA ( approximately 2.4 J/cm(2)) did not result in gamma-H2AX, however, co-exposure drastically induced foci of gamma-H2AX in a dose-dependent manner. gamma-H2AX could be detected even at very low concentration of BaP (10(-9)M) plus UVA (0.6J/cm(2)), which did not change cell survival rates. NaN(3) effectively inhibited the formation of gamma-H2AX induced by co-exposure, indicating the contribution of singlet oxygen. This is the first evidence that co-exposure to BaP and UVA induced DSBs, involving gamma-H2AX.

<ABSTRACT>
Previous work from this laboratory had shown that ligases may catalyze the synthesis of (di)nucleoside polyphosphates. Here, we show that one of the enzymes of the proteasome system (E1 or the ubiquitin (Ub) activating enzyme, EC 6.3.2.19) catalyzes very effectively (k(cat) = 0.29+/-0.05 s(-1)) the transfer of AMP from the E-AMP-ubiquitin complex to tripolyphosphate or tetrapolyphosphate with formation of adenosine tetra- or pentaphosphate (p4A or p5A), respectively. Whereas the concomitant formation of AMP is stimulated by the presence of dithiothreitol in a concentration dependent manner, the synthesis of p4A is only slightly inhibited by this compound. Previous treatment of the enzyme (E1) with iodoacetamide inhibited only partially the synthesis of p4A. p4A can substitute for ATP as substrate of the reaction to generate the ubiquityl adenylate complex. A small amount of diadenosine pentaphosphate (Ap5A) was also synthesized in the presence of p4A.

<ABSTRACT>
The spatial and temporal targeting of proteins or protein assemblies to appropriate sites is crucial to regulate the specificity and efficiency of protein-protein interactions, thus dictating the timing and intensity of cell signaling and responses. The resultant dynamic mass redistribution could be manifested by label free optical biosensor, and lead to a novel and functional optical signature for studying cell signaling. Here we applied this technology, termed as mass redistribution cell assay technology (MRCAT), to study the signaling networks of bradykinin B(2) receptor in A431 cells. Using MRCAT, the spatial and temporal relocation of proteins and protein assemblies mediated by bradykinin was quantitatively monitored in microplate format and in live cells. The saturability to bradykinin, together with the specific and dose-dependent inhibition by a B(2) specific antagonist HOE140, suggested that the optical signature is a direct result of B(2) receptor activation. The sensitivity of the optical signature to cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin argued that B(2) receptor signaling is dependent on the integrity of lipid rafts; disruption of these microdomains hinders the B(2) signaling. Modulations of several important intracellular targets with specific inhibitors suggested that B(2) receptor activation results in signaling via at least dual pathways - G(s)- and G(q)-mediated signaling. Remarkably, the two signaling pathways counter-regulate each other. Several critical downstream targets including protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and epidermal growth factor receptor had been identified to involve in B(2) signaling. The roles of endocytosis and cytoskeleton modulation in B(2) signaling were also demonstrated.

<ABSTRACT>
Human brain cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) is cleaved within its highly conserved domain at amino acid 110/111/112. This cleavage generates a highly stable C-terminal fragment (C1). We examined the relative abundance of holo- and truncated PrP(c) in human cerebral cortex and we found important inter-individual variations in the proportion of C1. Neither age nor postmortem interval explain the large variability observed in C1 amount. Interestingly, our results show that high levels of C1 are associated with the presence of the active ADAM 10 suggesting this zinc metalloprotease as a candidate for the cleavage of PrP(c) in the human brain.

Epigenetic and classical activation of Entamoeba histolytica heat shock
protein 100 (EHsp100) expression.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica expresses a cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferase (Ehmeth) that belongs to the DNMT2 protein family. The biological function of members of this DNMT2 family is unknown. In the present study, the 5' region of E. histolytica heat shock protein 100 (5'EHsp100) was isolated by affinity chromatography with 5-methylcytosine antibodies as ligand. The methylation status of 5'EHsp100 was confirmed by sodium bisulfite sequencing. We showed that the expression of EHsp100 was induced by heat shock, 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase and Trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase. The effect of TSA on EHsp100 expression was rapidly reversed by removing the drug from the culture. In contrast, EHsp100 expression was still detectable one month after removing 5-AzaC from the media. Whereas 5-AzaC and TSA caused demethylation in the promoter region of EHsp100, no demethylation was observed following heat shock. Remarkably, DNA that includes three putative heat shock elements identified in the promoter region of EHsp100 bound to a protein of 37kDa present in the nuclear fraction of heat-shocked trophozoites but absent in the nuclear fraction of 5-AzaC and TSA treated trophozoites. Our data suggest that EHsp100 expression can be regulated by both a classical and an epigenetic mechanism.

Plasma membrane and lysosomal localization of CB1 cannabinoid receptor are
dependent on lipid rafts and regulated by anandamide in human breast
cancer cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 21;579(28):6343-9. Epub 2005 Oct 24.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In this report we show, by confocal analysis of indirect immunofluorescence, that the type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R), which belongs to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors, is expressed on the plasma membrane in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. However, a substantial proportion of the receptor is present in lysosomes. We found that CB1R is associated with cholesterol- and sphyngolipid-enriched membrane domains (rafts). Cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MCD) treatment strongly reduces the flotation of the protein on the raft-fractions (DRM) of sucrose density gradients suggesting that CB1 raft-association is cholesterol dependent. Interestingly binding of the agonist, anandamide (AEA) also impairs DRM-association of the receptor suggesting that the membrane distribution of the receptor is dependent on rafts and is possibly regulated by the agonist binding. Indeed MCD completely blocked the clustering of CB1R at the plasma membrane. On the contrary the lysosomal localization of CB1R was impaired by this treatment only after AEA binding.

Sensitivity of the Drosophila para sodium channel to DDT is not lowered by
the super-kdr mutation M918T on the IIS4-S5 linker that profoundly reduces
sensitivity to permethrin and deltamethrin.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 21;579(28):6317-25. Epub 2005 Oct 21.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
DDT inhibits Na channel inactivation and deactivation, promotes Na channel activation and reduces the resting potential of Xenopus oocytes expressing the Drosophila para Na channel. These changes are only marginally influenced by the single mutation M918T (super-kdr) but are reduced approximately 10-fold by either the single mutation L1014F (kdr) or the double mutation L1014F+M918T, both of which confer resistance to the pyrethroids permethrin and deltamethrin. We conclude that DDT binds either to or in the region of L1014 on IIS6 but only weakly to M918 on the IIS4-S5 linker, which is part of a high-affinity binding site for permethrin and deltamethrin.

<ABSTRACT>
The structural properties of a key transient oxygen intermediate of cytochrome c oxidase, P(R), remain an enigma, although inferences have been drawn from its equilibrium analogues, [Pco/o(2)] , P(H) and P(M). With resonance Raman spectroscopy, an oxygen isotope-sensitive band at 806 cm(-1) was observed in [Pco/o(2)] produced by adding CO and O(2) to the resting enzyme. The vibrational band shifted to 771 cm(-1) upon isotopic substitution of (16)O(2) with (18)O(2). The same modes at 806 and 771 cm(-1) were present simultaneously when the mixed isotope, (18)O(16)O, was employed, indicating that in [Pco/o(2)] the O-O bond is cleaved, resulting in a Fe(4+)O(2-) structure. This result unifies the nature of the three equilibrium analogues of the P(R) intermediate.

CD45 expression on rat acinar cells: involvement in pro-inflammatory
cytokine production.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 21;579(28):6355-60. Epub 2005 Oct 24.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
CD45 transduces activation signals in inflammatory cells. We investigate CD45 expression on pancreatic acinar cells and examine its role in the inflammatory response which these cells have also shown under certain circumstances. Similar CD45 mRNA levels were found in acinar cells and leukocytes (positive control). Flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analysis showed a heterogeneous CD45 distribution on acinar cells. Activation of acinar cells by incubation with pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid as evidencied by TNF-alpha production resulted in a decreased CD45 expression, suggesting that CD45 acts as a negative regulator of cytokine production. As a validation of this finding in vivo, a decrease in the acinar CD45 expression in parallel with an increased ability to produce TNF-alpha was found in rats with acute pancreatitis. Our data show that CD45 is constitutively expressed in acinar cells and suggest that it plays an important role in negatively regulating cytokine production.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Replicatively and oxidatively senescent human fibroblasts demonstrate an impaired response to mitogens. To investigate whether this is due to downregulation of growth factor receptors we examined their expression in these two types of senescence. mRNA and protein levels of the insulin receptor and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) alpha-receptor decreased in replicatively senescent cells. The PDGF beta-receptor and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor at the protein level also decreased but remained readily detectable. However, these major growth factor receptors remained unchanged in oxidatively premature senescent cells. This suggests that mechanisms underlying diminished responsiveness to mitogens might be different in replicative senescence and oxidatively premature senescence.

<ABSTRACT>
To process large numbers of samples in parallel is one potential of protein microarrays for research and diagnostics. However, the application of protein arrays is currently hampered by the lack of comprehensive technological knowledge about the suitability of 2-D and 3-D slide surface coatings. We have performed a systematic study to analyze how both surface types perform in combination with different fluorescent dyes to generate significant and reproducible data. In total, we analyzed more than 100 slides containing 1152 spots each. Slides were probed against different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and recombinant fusion proteins. We found two surface coatings to be most suitable for protein and antibody (Ab) immobilization. These were further subjected to quantitative analyses by evaluating intraslide and slide-to-slide reproducibilities, and the linear range of target detection. In summary, we demonstrate that only suitable combinations of surface and fluorescent dyes allow the generation of highly reproducible data.

<ABSTRACT>
The discharge of chemicals such as oil associated or not with derived products constitutes a real threat for the environment. We report here the differential expression of the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) gill proteins corresponding to two contaminated environmental conditions: crude oil and offshore produced water. In order to evaluate and understand contaminants, effects and adaptive response of these organisms, we identified proteins using MS. The latter can be grouped into three main classes: proteins involved in the cellular structure, in metabolism, and in defence proteins.

Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4973-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
HSA has been shown to react with many organic toxicants to form adducts that are useful biomarkers for exposure. Albumin isolation is an important first step for the analysis of these protein-toxicant adducts. We tested several approaches to isolate albumin from serum treated with an electrophilic organic toxicant known to form adducts with albumin, i.e., sulfur mustard agent (HD) (2,2'-dichloroethyl sulfide), in order to evaluate these techniques as purification methods. To select the most efficient isolation strategy, methods were evaluated using gel electrophoresis, total protein quantitation, and peptide-adduct identification by MS. Results suggest that the albumin-rich fractions obtained can be used to identify exposure by quantitating the albumin adducts to electrophilic organic toxicants such as HD. The HiTrap Blue HP albumin isolation system appears to display the most promising results for purifying albumin to detect HD-adducts, exhibiting high purification efficiency, satisfactory albumin recovery, promising specificity, and a higher loading capacity for serum.

<ABSTRACT>
Pro-Q Diamond (Pro-Q DPS) is a commercially available stain that binds the phosphate moiety of phosphoproteins with high sensitivity and linearity. To conserve consumable costs we demonstrate that threefold diluted Pro-Q DPS offers the same sensitivity and linearity of signal to that obtained with undiluted Pro-Q DPS. The optimal conditions for Pro-Q DPS indicate that fixation, staining, and destaining of gels longer than 1 h, 2 h, and four 30-min incubations, respectively, are not required. The fixation and destaining solutions, but not the threefold diluted Pro-Q DPS, can be re-used without compromising the signal intensity or linear dynamic range. This modified protocol of Pro-Q DPS reduces the cost at least by fourfold, making the stain economically attractive for large-scale analysis of phosphoproteins.

A quantitative proteomic analysis of growth factor-induced compositional
changes in lipid rafts of human smooth muscle cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4733-42.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Signals that promote proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells (SMC) have been implicated in pathologic growth of hollow organs. Members of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family, potent mitogens and motility factors for SMC, have been shown to signal through cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts. We recently demonstrated that PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis in urinary tract SMC was dependent on the integrity of lipid rafts. Despite its known ability to rapidly alter discrete proteins within rafts, the effect of PDGF on overall raft protein composition is unknown. In this study, we employed isotope coded affinity tag (ICAT) analysis to evaluate PDGF-induced protein changes in lipid rafts of primary culture human SMC. Following acute (i.e., 15 min) exposure of SMC to PDGF, 23 proteins increased in rafts >20%. In contrast, raft localization of only three proteins increased after 12 h of PDGF treatment. Among the proteins that increased at 15 min were the glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins Thy-1, 5'-nucleotidase, and CD55, the cytoskeletal proteins actin, actinin, tropomyosin-3 and -4, and the endocytosis-related proteins clathrin and beta-adaptin. In addition, eight Rho family members were localized to rafts by ICAT analysis. Collectively, these observations suggest a role for lipid rafts in regulation of PDGF-stimulated changes in the cytoskeleton.

Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4927-35.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Adipose tissue plays an active role in the development of obesity, and thus characterization of the molecular changes related to obesity in this tissue is a priority. Recently, we identified tungstate as a potent body weight reducing agent in obese animals, adipose tissue being one of the targets of its action. In this study a proteomics approach combining 2-DE and MS was used to identify proteins associated with obesity and targets of tungstate in white adipose tissue. Twenty-nine proteins were found differentially expressed between lean and diet-induced obese rats. Expression changes in transferrin, vimentin, vinculin, peroxiredoxins, Rho-GTP dissociation inhibitor, grifin, guanine deaminase and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase were associated here for the first time with obesity. Furthermore, tungstate treatment of obese rats reverted expression changes of 70% of the proteins modulated by obesity and another ten proteins were regulated by tungstate independently of the body weight reduction. The results suggest that the tungstate antiobesity effect can be mediated by the modulation of cellular structure, metabolism, redox state and signalling processes in adipose tissue. These findings open new avenues for the study of the aetiology of obesity and its treatment.

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4673-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The development of a sensitive fluorescence-based assay for the quantitative determination of protein concentration is described. The assay is based on the natural product epicocconone, which produces a large increase in fluorescence quantum yield upon binding to detergent-coated proteins in solution. There is a concomitant shift in the emission maximum from 520 to 605 nm after binding, which results in low background signal allowing a linear dynamic range of 40 ng/mL to 200 microg/mL for most proteins. There is little protein-to-protein variation except for iron-containing proteins and the assay can be used so that it is tolerant of chemicals commonly used in 2-D sample buffers. The assay is more sensitive than standard absorption assays such as the Bradford and Lowry assays, and has a greater dynamic range and sensitivity than other fluorescent assays.

<ABSTRACT>
We present here the first proteomics analysis of uveal melanoma (UM) cells. These cells represent a good model for the identification of polypeptide markers, which could be developed as diagnostic tools. UM is the most common primary intraocular tumour in adults. In contrast to other cancers, the survival rate of patients with this malignancy has changed little over the past few decades; a better understanding of the molecular biology of UM oncogenesis and metastasis is needed to build the basis for the identification of novel drug targets. In the study presented here, proteins from a UM primary cell culture were separated by 2-DE using a pI 3-10 gradient; 270 spots were analysed by LC-MS/MS, identifying 683 proteins derived from 393 different genes. Of those, 69 (18%) are related to cancer processes involving cell division, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, oncogenesis, drug resistance and others. To our knowledge, 96% of the proteins identified, including 16 hypothetical proteins, have never been reported in UM before. This study represents the first step towards the establishment of a UM protein database as a valuable resource for the study of this malignancy.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 7;579(27):6128-34. Epub 2005 Oct 11.

<ABSTRACT>
The NK-lysin derived peptide NK-2 is a potent antibacterial, but non-toxic to a human keratinocyte cell line and of low hemolytic activity. Its target selectivity is based upon a strong binding preference to membranes containing anionic phospholipids, which are normally not found on the surface of human cells. Here, we analyzed the interaction of NK-2 with normal human lymphocytes and seven different human cancer cell lines and demonstrate that some of these cells expose negatively charged surface phosphatidylserine (PS), which presumably facilitates killing of the cells by NK-2. This is underlined by the specific intercalation of the peptide into PS-containing liposomes analyzed by fluorescence-resonance energy transfer spectroscopy.

<ABSTRACT>
Glu-tRNA is either bound to elongation factor Tu to enter protein synthesis or is reduced by glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR) in the first step of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in most bacteria, archaea and in chloroplasts. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, a bacterium that synthesizes a vast amount of heme, contains three genes encoding tRNA(Glu). All tRNA(Glu) species are substrates in vitro of GluRS1 from A. ferrooxidans.Glu-tRNA(3)(Glu), that fulfills the requirements for protein synthesis, is not substrate of GluTR. Therefore, aminoacylation of tRNA(3)(Glu) might contribute to ensure protein synthesis upon high heme demand by an uncoupling of protein and heme biosynthesis.

<ABSTRACT>
All medically useful antibiotics should have the potential to distinguish between target microbes (bacteria) and host cells. Although many antibiotics that target bacterial protein synthesis show little effect on the translation machinery of the eukaryotic cytoplasm, it is unclear whether these antibiotics target or not the mitochondrial translation machinery. We employed an in vitro translation system from bovine mitochondria, which consists of mitochondrial ribosomes and mitochondrial elongation factors, to estimate the effect of antibiotics on mitichondrial protein synthesis. Tetracycline and thiostrepton showed similar inhibitory effects on both Escherichia coli and mitochondrial protein synthesis. The mitochondrial system was more resistant to tiamulin, macrolides, virginiamycin, fusidic acid and kirromycin than the E. coli system. The present results, taken together with atomic structure of the ribosome, may provide useful information for the rational design of new antibiotics having less adverse effects in humans and animals.

Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4839-51.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The green alga Haematococcus pluvialis has a plant-like cell wall consisting of glycoproteins and cellulose that is modified during the cell cycle and under various conditions. These features allow Haematococcus to be used as a model organism for studying cell wall biology. Development of the Haematococcus model is hampered by the absence of mutants that could provide insight into the biosynthesis and assembly of wall components. Haematococcus mutants (WM#537 and WM#2978) (WM--wall mutant) with defective cell walls were obtained by chemical mutagenesis. WM#537 features a secondary wall of considerably reduced thickness, whereas WM#2978 possesses a somewhat reduced secondary wall with little intervening space between the wall and plasmalemma. 2-DE revealed that a majority of the cell wall proteins were present in the wild-type and mutant cell walls throughout the cell cycle. PMF identified 55 wall protein orthologs from these strains, including a subset of induced proteins known to be involved in wall construction, remodeling, and defense. Down-regulation of certain wall proteins in the two mutants was associated with the wall defects, whereas overexpression of other proteins may have compensated for the defective walls in the two mutants.

<ABSTRACT>
Shigella flexneri 2a is an important pathogen causing bacillary dysentery in humans. In order to investigate any potential vaccine candidate proteins present in outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and extracellular proteins of S. flexneri 2a 2457T, we use the proteome mapping and database analyzing techniques. A subproteome map and database of OMPs were established first. One hundred and nine of the total 126 marked spots were cut out and processed to MALDI-TOF-MS and PMF. Eighty-seven spots were identified and they represented 55 OMP entries. Furthermore, immunoproteomics analysis of OMPs and extracellular proteins were performed. Total of 34 immunoreactive spots were identified, in which 22 and 12 were from OMPs and extracellular proteins, respectively. Eight novel antigens were found and some of these antigens may be potential vaccine candidate proteins. These results are useful for future studying of pathogenicity, vaccine, and novel antibacterial drugs. Maps and tables of all identified proteins are available on the Internet at www.proteomics.com.cn.

Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4665-72.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The alteration of glycosyltransferase expression and the subsequent changes in oligosaccharide structures are reported in several diseases. The analysis of glycan structural alteration in glycoproteins is becoming increasingly important in the discovery of therapies and diagnostic markers. In this study, we propose a strategy for glycomic/glycoproteomic analysis based on oligosaccharide profiling by LC/MS followed by proteomic approaches, including 2-DE and 2-D lectin blot. As a model of aberrant cells, we used Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III), which catalyzes the addition of a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to beta-mannose of the mannosyl core of N-linked oligosaccharides. LC/MS equipped with a graphitized carbon column (GCC) enabled us to elucidate the structural alteration induced by the GnT-III expression. Using 2-D lectin blot followed by LC/MS/MS, the protein carrying an extra N-acetylhexosamine in cells transfected with GnT-III was successfully identified as integrin alpha3. Thus, oligosaccharide profiling by GCC-LC/MS followed by proteomic methods can be a powerful tool for glycomic/glycoproteomic analysis.

Albumin depletion of human plasma also removes low abundance proteins

Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4713-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The use of proteomics for efficient, accurate, and complete analysis of clinical samples poses a variety of technical challenges. The presence of higher abundance proteins in the plasma, such as albumin, may mask the detection of lower abundance proteins such as the cytokines. Methods have been proposed to deplete the sample of these higher abundance proteins to facilitate detection of those with lower abundance. In this study, a commercially available albumin depletion kit was used to determine if removal of albumin would measurably reduce detection of lower abundance cytokine proteins in human plasma. The Montage Albumin Deplete Kit (Millipore) was used to deplete albumin from LPS-stimulated whole blood from 15 normal human donors. Albumin depletion was measured using the BCG reagent and SDS-PAGE, and cytokine recovery was determined by a microassay immunoassay that measures both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Average albumin depletion from the samples was 72%. However, several cytokines were also significantly reduced when the albumin was removed from the plasma. Additionally, there was a variable reduction in cytokine recovery from a known mixture of cytokines in a minimal amount of plasma that were loaded onto the columns. These data demonstrate that there may be a non-specific loss of cytokines following albumin depletion, which may confound subsequent proteomic analysis.

Human urine proteome analysis by three separation approaches.

Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4994-5001.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The urinary proteome is known to be a valuable field of study related to organ functions. There have been several extensive urine proteome studies. However, the overlapping rate among different studies is relatively low. Whether the low overlapping rate was caused by different sample sources, preparation, separation and identification methods is unknown. Moreover, low molecular mass (<10 kDa) proteins have not been studied extensively. In this report, male and female pooled urine samples were collected from healthy volunteers. The urinary proteins were acetone precipitated, separated and identified by three approaches, 1-DE plus 1-D LC/MS/MS, direct 1-D LC/MS/MS and 2-D LC/MS/MS. 1-D tricine gels were used to separate low molecular mass proteins. The tandem mass spectra of positive identifications were quality controlled both by manual validation and using advanced mass spectrum scanner software. A total of 226 urinary proteins were identified; 171 proteins were identified by proteomics approach for the first time, including 4 male-specific proteins. Twelve low molecular mass proteins were identified. Most urinary proteins had a molecular mass between 30 and 60 kDa and a pI between 4 and 10. The apparent molecular masses of many proteins were different from theoretical ones, which indicated their post-translational modification and degradation. The effects of sample preparation, separation and identification methods on the overlapping rate of different experiments are discussed.

Proteomics-based analysis of a counter-oxidative stress system in
Porphyromonas gingivalis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):251-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative anaerobic pathogen associated with chronic periodontitis. Although anaerobic, P. gingivalis exhibits a high degree of aerotolerance, which enables it to survive within periodontal pockets. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of oxidative stress on protein expression in P. gingivalis to obtain a better understanding of the mechanism underlying its aerotolerance. To accomplish this, P. gingivalis cells were grown under conditions of hemin limitation (0.01 microg/mL) to avoid the oxygen protective effect of hemin on oxidative stress. The proteins were then extracted from cultures either left untreated or subjected to oxidative stress and separated by 2-DE. The resultant protein expression profiles were examined by image scanning, and those found to differ depending on the presence or absence of aeration were subjected to MALDI-MS and then analyzed using the ORF database of P. gingivalis W83 from The Institute of Genomic Research. Oxidative stress was found to affect the expression of numerous proteins in P. gingivalis cells. In particular, the levels of HtpG, GroEL, DnaK, AhpC, TPR domain protein, and trigger factor were substantially increased.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):181-92.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Streptococcus thermophilus is a Gram-positive bacterium belonging to the group of lactic acid bacteria, among which several genera play an essential role in manufacture of food products. Recently, a genomic consortium sequenced and annotated its entire genome, which has been demonstrated to contain 1900 coding sequences. In this study, we have revealed the expression products of almost 200 different genes using a proteomic strategy combining 2-DE plus MALDI-TOF PMF and differential 1-DE plus muLC-ESI-IT-MS/MS. Thus, a number of cellular pathways related to important physiological processes were described at the proteomic level. Almost 50 genes were related to multiple electrophoretic species, whose heterogeneity was mainly due to variability in pI values. A 2-DE reference map obtained for lactose-grown cells was compared with those obtained after heat, cold, acid, oxidative and starvation stresses. Protein up/down-regulation measurements demonstrated that adaptation to different environmental challenges may involve the contribution of unique as well as combined physiological mechanisms. Common regulatory sites in the promoter region of genes whose expression was induced after stress were identified. These results provide a better comprehension of biochemical processes related to stress resistance in S. thermophilus, allowing defining the molecular bases of adaptative responses or markers for the identification of strains with potential industrial applications.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Due to their unique capability to attack lignified biopolymers, extracellular enzymes of white-rot fungi enjoy an increasing interest in various fields of white biotechnology. The edible fungus Pleurotus sapidus was selected as a model organism for the analysis of the secretome by means of 2-DE. For enzyme production, the fungus was grown in submerged cultures either on peanut shells or on glass wool as a carrier material. Identification of the secreted enzymes was performed by tryptic digestion, ESI-MS/MS ab initio sequencing, and homology searches against public databases. The spectrum of secreted enzymes comprised various types of hydrolases and lignolytic enzymes of the manganese peroxidase/versatile peroxidase family. While peptidases were secreted mainly by the cultures grown on peanut shells, versatile peroxidase type enzymes dominated in the cultures grown on glass wool.

Pathogen elicitor-induced changes in the maize extracellular matrix
proteome.

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4894-904.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The extracellular matrix is a vital compartment in plants with a prominent role in defence against pathogen attack. Using a maize cell suspension culture system and pathogen elicitors, responses to pathogen attack that are localised to the extracellular matrix were examined by a proteomic approach. Elicitor treatment of cell cultures induced a rapid change in the phosphorylation status of extracellular peroxidases, the apparent disappearance of a putative extracellular beta-N-acetylglucosamonidase, and accumulation of a secreted putative xylanase inhibitor protein. Onset of the defence response was attended by an accumulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and a fragment of a putative heat shock protein. Several distinct spots of both proteins, which preferentially accumulated in cell wall protein fractions, were identified. These three novel observations, viz. (i) secretion of a new class of putative enzyme inhibitor, (ii) the apparent recruitment of classical cytosolic proteins into the cell wall and (ii) the change in phosphorylation status of extracellular matrix proteins, suggest that the extracellular matrix plays a complex role in defence. We discuss the role of the extracellular matrix in signal modulation during pathogen-induced defence responses.

High-throughput MS-based protein phenotyping: application to haptoglobin.

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):5002-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A high-throughput affinity capture and reduction approach was developed for phenotype and post-translational modification analysis of a complexed globular protein, haptoglobin (Hp), directly from human plasma. Hp was selectively retrieved utilizing anti-Hp antibodies immobilized onto affinity pipette tips, eluted onto a formatted mass spectrometer target for reduction of Hp alpha-chains (Hpalpha1 and Hpalpha2) and subjected to subsequent MALDI-MS analysis. The affinity capture and reduction approach was originally developed from a pre-extraction reduction methodology that was optimized to an affinity capture post-reduction technique for intact Hp alpha-chain variant analysis, phenotype classification and ensuing post-translational variant detection. Three common Hp phenotypes (1-1, 2-1 and 2-2) were assigned according to detection of Hpalpha1 and/or Hpalpha2 reduced intact chain(s) average mass(es). The affinity capture post-reduction approach was scaled for high-throughput Hp alpha-chain phenotype analysis from a normal plasma cohort. The entire sample cohort was successfully analyzed and phenotyped using the developed approach. Additionally, Hp post-translational variants were detected and assigned via accurate MS analyses. The results of this study suggest use of the methodology in future analyses of other similarly complexed proteins and in normal versus disease cohort population proteomics studies.

Virtual identification of essential proteins within the protein
interaction network of yeast.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):35-40.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Topological analysis of large scale protein-protein interaction networks (PINs) is important for understanding the organizational and functional principles of individual proteins. The number of interactions that a protein has in a PIN has been observed to be correlated with its indispensability. Essential proteins generally have more interactions than the nonessential ones. We show here that the lethality associated with removal of a protein from the yeast proteome correlates with different centrality measures of the nodes in the PIN, such as the closeness of a protein to many other proteins, or the number of pairs of proteins which need a specific protein as an intermediary in their communications, or the participation of a protein in different protein clusters in the PIN. These measures are significantly better than random selection in identifying essential proteins in a PIN. Centrality measures based on graph spectral properties of the network, in particular the subgraph centrality, show the best performance in identifying essential proteins in the yeast PIN. Subgraph centrality gives important structural information about the role of individual proteins, and permits the selection of possible targets for rational drug discovery through the identification of essential proteins in the PIN.

Proteomic analysis of rat laryngeal muscle following denervation.

Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4764-76.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Laryngeal muscle atrophy induced by nerve injury is a major factor contributing to the disabling symptoms associated with laryngeal paralysis. Alterations of global proteins in rat laryngeal muscle following denervation were, therefore, studied using proteomic techniques. Twenty-eight adult Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into normal control and denervated groups. The thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle was excised 60 days after right recurrent laryngeal nerve was resected. Protein separation and identification were preformed using 2-DE and MALDI-MS with database search. Forty-four proteins were found to have significant alteration in expression level after denervation. The majority of these proteins (57%), most of them associated with energy metabolism, cellular proliferation and differentiation, signal transduction and stress reaction, were decreased levels of expression in denervated TA muscle. The remaining 43% of the proteins, most of them involved with protein degradation, immunoreactivity, injury repair, contraction, and microtubular formation, were found to have increased levels of expression. The protein modification sites by phosphorylation were detected in 22% of the identified proteins that presented multiple-spot patterns on 2-D gel. Significant changes in protein expression in denervated laryngeal muscle may provide potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of laryngeal paralysis.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):131-42.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
There has been increasing interest in the potential applications of gold (III) complexes as anticancer drugs with higher cytotoxicity and fewer side effects than existing metal anticancer drugs. Our previous findings demonstrated that gold (III) porphyrin 1a preferentially induced apoptosis in a cancer cell line (SUNE1). In this study, we identified differentially expressed proteins related to the drug's cytotoxic action by comparing the protein alterations induced by gold (III) porphyrin 1a and cisplatin treatments. Several clusters of altered proteins were identified, including cellular structure and stress-related chaperone proteins, proteins involved in reactive oxygen species and enzyme proteins, translation factors, proteins that mediate cell proliferation or differentiation, and proteins participating in the internal degradation systems. Our results indicated that multiple factors leading to apoptosis were involved in drug cytotoxicity in SUNE1 cells. The balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals determined the final fate of cancer cells.

<ABSTRACT>
The chicken (Gallus gallus) is one of the primary models for embryological and developmental studies. In order to begin to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the normal and abnormal development of the chicken, we used 2-DE to construct a whole-embryo proteome map. Proteins were separated by IEF on IPG strips, and by 11% SDS-PAGE) gels. Protein identification was performed by means of PMF with MALDI-TOF-MS. In all, 105 protein spots were identified, 35 of them implicated in embryo development, 10 related with some diseases, and 16, finally, being proteins that have never been identified, purified or characterized in the chicken before. This map will be updated continuously and will serve as a reference database for investigators, studying changes at the protein level under different physiological conditions.

Extending ribosomal protein identifications to unsequenced bacterial
strains using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass
spectrometry.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Dec;5(18):4818-31.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A protocol has been developed that allows protein identifications using available DNA-based or protein sequences from a reference strain of a bacterial species to be extended to bacterial strains for which no prior DNA-based or protein sequence information exists. The protocol is predicated on careful isolation of a specific sub-cellular group of proteins. In this study, ribosomal proteins were chosen due to their high relative abundance and similarity in copy number per cell. After isolation of ribosomal proteins, MALDI-MS is used to acquire accurate protein molecular weights. An iterative comparison of reference protein molecular weights and identities is made to the resulting data, allowing for the straightforward identification of ribosomal proteins from any non-reference strains. This approach can reveal differences between proteins at the amino acid or post-translational level. The protocol was developed, validated and applied to ribosomal proteins from three strains of the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus. This approach revealed that nearly 60% of the ribosomal proteins from all three strains are identical. The extension of protein identification to additional bacterial strains can be useful in phylogenetic studies as well as in biomarker identification.

Immobilization of diverse foreign proteins in viral polyhedra and
potential application for protein microarrays.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):54-66.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cypoviruses are insect viruses that produce a cytoplasmic crystalline particle called the polyhedron in which progeny virions are occluded. The virion structural protein, VP3, is implicated in the occlusion of viral particles into polyhedra. In this study, we determined the amino acid sequence of VP3 required for occlusion of viral particles into polyhedra and proposed that this sequence could be used as an immobilization signal to direct the stable incorporation of foreign proteins into polyhedra. A large-scale survey revealed that the immobilization signal could, in fact, direct the incorporation of a variety of human proteins into polyhedra. Immune reactivity and protein-protein interactions were detected on the surface of polyhedra containing immobilized foreign proteins, and these particles were shown to be highly stabilized against dehydration. We showed that these particles could be arrayed onto a glass slide by standard spotting and laser manipulation methods. Thus, this approach is well suited for protein expression, purification, and the development of protein microarrays.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
With the completion of the sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome and the recent advances in proteomic technology, the identification of proteins from highly complex mixtures is now possible. Rather than using gel electrophoresis and peptide mass fingerprinting, we have used multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) to analyse the "tightly-bound" proteome for purified cell walls from Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures. Using bioinformatics for the prediction of signal peptides for targeting to the secretory pathway and for the absence of ER retention signal, 89 proteins were selected as potential extracellular proteins. Only 33% of these were identified in previous proteomic analyses of Arabidopsis cell walls. A functional classification revealed that a large proportion of the proteins were enzymes, notably carbohydrate active enzymes, peroxidases and proteases. Comparison of all the published proteomic analyses for the Arabidopsis cell wall identified 268 non-redundant genes encoding wall proteins. Sixty of these (22%) were derived from our analysis of tightly-bound wall proteins.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):312-20.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
During early stages of embryo development, the brain cavity is filled with embryonic cerebrospinal fluid (E-CSF), a complex fluid containing different protein fractions that contributes to the regulation of the survival, proliferation and neurogenesis of the neuroectodermal stem cells. Using 2-DE, protein sequencing and database searches, we identified and analyzed the proteome of the E-CSF from chick embryos (Gallus gallus). We identified 26 different gene products, including proteins related to the extracellular matrix, proteins associated with the regulation of osmotic pressure and metal transport, proteins related to cell survival, MAP kinase activators, proteins involved in the transport of retinol and vitamin D, antioxidant and antimicrobial proteins, intracellular proteins and some unknown proteins. Most of these gene products are involved in the regulation of developmental processes during embryogenesis in systems other than E-CSF. Interestingly, 14 of them are also present in adult human CSF proteome, and it has been reported that they are altered in the CSF of patients suffering neurodegenerative diseases and/or neurological disorders. Understanding these molecules and the mechanisms they control during embryonic neurogenesis is a key contribution to the general understanding of CNS development, and may also contribute to greater knowledge of these human diseases.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Purified thylakoid membranes from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were used for the first time in proteomic studies. The membranes were prepared by a combination of sucrose density centrifugation and aqueous polymer two-phase partitioning. In total, 76 different proteins were identified from 2- and 1-D gels by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Twelve of the identified proteins have a predicted Sec/Tat signal peptide. Fourteen of the proteins were known, or predicted to be, integral membrane proteins. Among the proteins identified were subunits of the well-characterized thylakoid membrane constituents Photosystem I and II, ATP synthase, cytochrome b6f-complex, NADH dehydrogenase, and phycobilisome complex. In addition, novel thylakoid membrane proteins, both integral and peripheral were found, including enzymes involved in protein folding and pigment biosynthesis. The latter were the chlorophyll biosynthesis enzymes, light-dependent protochlorophyllide reductase and geranylgeranyl reductase as well as phytoene desaturase involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and a water-soluble carotenoid-binding protein. Interestingly, in view of the protein sorting mechanism in cyanobacteria, one of the two signal peptidases type I of Synechocystis was found in the thylakoid membrane, whereas the second one has been identified previously in the plasma membrane. Sixteen proteins are hypothetical proteins with unknown function.

Growth hormone (GH) receptor knockout mice reveal actions of GH in lung
development.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):341-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The presence of growth hormone (GH) and GH receptors (GHRs) in the lung suggests it is an autocrine/paracrine target site for pulmonary GH action and/or an endocrine site of pituitary GH action. Roles for GH in lung growth or pulmonary function are, however, uncertain. The possibility that pituitary and/or pulmonary GH have physiological roles in lung development has therefore been investigated in GHR knockout (KO or -/-) mice, using a proteomics approach to determine if an absence of GH-signaling affects the proteome of the developing lung. More than 600 proteins were detected by 2-DE in the lungs of control [GHR (+/+)] and GHR (-/-) mice at the end of the alveolarization period (at day 14 postnatally). Of these, 39 differed significantly in protein content at the p>0.05 level [6 were of higher abundance in the GHR (-/-) group, 33 were of lower abundance] and 17 differed at the p>0.02 level [5 of higher abundance in the GHR (-/-) group, 12 of lower abundance] and 7 were definitively identified by MS. Vimentin, a protein involved in cellular proliferation, was reduced in content by approximately 75% in the lungs of the GHR (-/-) mice. Three proteins involved in oxidative protection [SH3 domain-binding glutamic acid-rich-like protein, peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1] were also of lower content in the GHR (-/-) lungs (by approximately 88%, 81% and 70%, respectively). Prdx6 is also involved in lipid and surfactant metabolism, as is apolipoprotein A-IV, the lung content of which was reduced by approximately 73% in these mice. Proteasome 26S ATPase subunit 4, a protein involved in the non-lysosomal degradation of intracellular proteins, and electron flavoprotein alpha subunit , involved in intracellular metabolism, were also reduced in content in the lungs of the GHR (-/-) mice (by approximately 70% and 49%, respectively). These results therefore suggest that these proteins are normally dependent upon GH signaling, and that GH is normally involved in early lung growth, oxidative protection, lipid and energy metabolism and in proteasomal activity. These roles may reflect endocrine actions of pituitary GH and/or local autocrine/paracrine actions of GH produced within the lung.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):375-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In this study, the importance of different domains of the fibrinogen molecule in the binding and assembly of a surface plasminogen (plgn) activator has been analyzed. This was achieved using SELDI technology that enabled dissociation of bound fragments from intact bacteria and accurate distinction between fibrinogen fragments based on their molecular mass. These studies indicate that Streptococcus pyogenes binds directly to human fibrinogen fragment D but not fragment E. The predominant surface proteins binding to fragment D were associated with the mrp gene product. Surface-associated fibrinogen fragment D was capable of anchoring a functional surface plgn activator complex. Taken together, these data indicated that fragment D of fibrinogen is necessary and sufficient to anchor a plgn activator complex on the surface of Streptococcus pyogenes.

<ABSTRACT>
Bacterial lipoproteins are anchored to membranes through a lipid moiety attached to the N-terminal Cys. Escherichia coli possesses more than 90 species of lipoproteins, most of which are localized in the outer membrane and others in the inner membrane. Sorting of lipoproteins to the outer membrane requires the Lol system comprising five Lol proteins. An ATP-binding cassette transporter, LolCDE, initiates the lipoprotein sorting by mediating the detachment of outer membrane-specific lipoproteins from the inner membrane. LolCDE does not recognize lipoproteins possessing Asp at position 2, which therefore remain anchored to the inner membrane. We will discuss the mechanism of LolCDE based on data obtained through in vitro experiments.

<ABSTRACT>
We investigated topoisomerase II alpha promoter activity in epithelia. In confluent human keratinocytes the promoter (-557 to+90 bp) was upregulated by oncogenic Ras. In transgenic mice expressing GFP via the promoter, GFP expression in undamaged epidermis was confined to growing hair follicles. GFP was also expressed in intestinal crypts. GFP expression was upregulated in epidermis following wounding or phorbol ester treatment. In each situation GFP expression correlated with high endogenous topoisomerase II alpha expression and high proliferation. The mice therefore provide a useful model for non-invasive imaging of regions of high proliferation in normal or damaged epidermis.

<ABSTRACT>
2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), an endogenous cannabionoid receptor (CB1 and CB2) ligand, enhanced the adhesion of HL-60 cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells to fibronectin and the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. The CB2 receptor, Gi/Go, intracellular free Ca(2+) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase were shown to be involved in 2-AG-induced augmented cell adhesion. 2-AG also enhanced the adhesion of human monocytic leukemia U937 cells and peripheral blood monocytes. These results strongly suggest that 2-AG plays some essential role in inflammatory reactions and immune responses by inducing robust adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and adhesion molecules in several types of inflammatory cells and immune-competent cells.

Ha-Ras sensitizes transformed mouse skin cells to Anisomycin-induced
apoptosis.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Efforts have been made to develop a chemoprevention that selectively triggers apoptosis in malignant cancer cells. Here, we demonstrated that a mutated Ha-Ras activity is required in Anisomycin-induced apoptosis in transformed keratinocytes. Anisomycin stimulates JNK activity and apoptosis in oncogenic Ha-Ras positive cells, but not in normal keratinocytes. This effect was demonstrated in stably transfected cells with dominant negative Ha-Ras, that protected transformed cells, and oncogenic Ha-Ras that sensitized non-transformed cells to Anisomycin-induced apoptosis. Lastly, the treatment of cells with inhibitors of the JNK displayed resistance to Anisomycin induced apoptosis. These data suggests that the oncogenic Ha-Ras is important for Anisomycin-induced JNK activation and apoptosis in transformed keratinocytes.

<ABSTRACT>
Platelet-activating factor (PAF) augments angiogenesis by promoting the synthesis of a variety of angiogenic factors, via the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation. Recently, we reported that PAF upregulates MMP-9 expression in a NF-kappaB-dependent manner. In this study, we investigated the signaling pathway involved in PAF-induced MMP-9 expression in ECV304 cells. Our current data indicate that the Ca(2+)- or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling pathway is necessary for PAF-induced MMP-9 expression. Furthermore, PAF-induced NF-kappaB activation was blocked by selective inhibitors of Ca(2+), PI3K, or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Our results suggest that PAF-induced MMP-9 expression, in a NF-kappaB-dependent manner, is regulated by Ca(2+), PI3K and ERK signaling pathways.

A major ozonation product of cholesterol,

cardiomyoblasts.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cholesterol, a major neutral lipid component of biological membranes and the lung epithelial lining fluids, is susceptible to oxidation by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species including ozone. The oxidation by ozone in biological environments results in the formation of 3beta-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al (cholesterol secoaldehyde or CSeco, major product) along with some other minor products. Recently, CSeco has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. In this communication, we report that CSeco induces cytotoxicity in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts with an IC(50) of 8.9+/-1.29 microM (n=6). The observed effect of CSeco at low micromolar concentrations retained several key features of apoptosis, such as changes in nuclear morphology, phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA fragmentation, and caspase 3/7 activity. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with 5 microM CSeco for 24h, for instance, resulted in 30.8+/-3.28% apoptotic and 1.8+/-1.11% of necrotic cells as against DMSO controls that only showed 1.3+/-0.33% of apoptosis and 1.6+/-0.67% of necrosis. In general, the loss of cellular viability paralleled the increased occurrence of apoptotic cells in various CSeco treatments. This study, for the first time, demonstrates the induction of apoptotic cell death in cardiomyocytes by a cholesterol ozonation product, implying a role for ozone in myocardial injury.

Proinflammatory adipocytokines induce TIMP-1 expression in 3T3-L1

FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 21;579(28):6417-22. Epub 2005 Nov 2.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 is an adipocyte-secreted protein upregulated in obesity which promotes adipose tissue development. Furthermore, the proinflammatory adipocytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-6 induce insulin resistance, and plasma concentrations are increased during weight gain. In the current study, the impact of TNFalpha and IL-6 on TIMP-1 mRNA and protein expression was determined in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Interestingly, TNFalpha and IL-6 induced TIMP-1 protein secretion more than 3- and 2-fold, respectively. Furthermore, TIMP-1 mRNA was upregulated in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Inhibitor experiments suggested that nuclear factor kappaB and p 44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase are involved in both, basal and adipocytokine-induced TIMP-1 expression. Moreover, the thiazolidinedione troglitazone partly reversed TNFalpha- but not IL-6-induced TIMP-1 synthesis. Taken together, we demonstrate that TIMP-1 expression is selectively upregulated in fat cells by proinflammatory adipocytokines and might play a role in maintaining adipose tissue mass in obesity.

<ABSTRACT>
We analysed the effects of high cholesterol (HC) intake and reduced apolipoprotein E (apoE) activity on tau phosphorylation and on the activities of the major tau kinases and phosphatases in brains from wild-type and apoE-knockout (apoEKO) mice. We show that HC diet potently induced intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in apoEKO mice, as well as upregulation of several tau kinases, without affecting tau phosphatases. Our results suggest an interaction between dietary and genetic factors in the development of tauopathies, which can be relevant in humans, where the apoE4 isoform could have a lack of function as compared to other isoforms.

<ABSTRACT>
Trophinin mediates homophilic and apical cell adhesion between trophoblastic cells and endometrial epithelial cells, which is potentially the initial attachment step in human embryo implantation. Since trophinin is an atypical membrane protein without the signal sequence, it is possible that trophinin localizes to the cytoplasm. By treating trophinin-expressing trophoblastic cells with a series of detergents, we found significant levels of endogenous trophinin in the cytoplasm, particularly at the nuclear envelope (NE). Fluorescence photobleaching of GFP-trophinin expressed in COS-1 cells showed the stable association of trophinin with the NE, suggesting an additional role of trophinin besides apical cell adhesion.

<ABSTRACT>
Over the last decade, epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling has been used repeatedly as a test-bed for pioneering computational systems biology. Recent breakthroughs in our molecular understanding of EGF signaling pose new challenges for mathematical modeling strategies. Three key areas emerge as particularly relevant: the pervasive importance of compartmentalization and endosomal trafficking; the complexity of signalosome complexes; and the regulatory influence of diffusion and spatiality. Each one of them demands a drastic change in current computational approaches. We discuss recent developments in the field that address these emerging aspects in a new generation of more realistic - and potential more useful - models of EGF signaling.

<ABSTRACT>
The 1.7A resolution crystal structure of recombinant family G/11 beta-1,4-xylanase (rXynA) from Bacillus subtilis 1A1 shows a jellyroll fold in which two curved beta-sheets form the active-site and substrate-binding cleft. The onset of thermal denaturation of rXynA occurs at 328 K, in excellent agreement with the optimum catalytic temperature. Molecular dynamics simulations at temperatures of 298-328 K demonstrate that below the optimum temperature the thumb loop and palm domain adopt a closed conformation. However, at 328 K these two domains separate facilitating substrate access to the active-site pocket, thereby accounting for the optimum catalytic temperature of the rXynA.

<ABSTRACT>
Multivariate analyses are often used to identify major trends of variation in synonymous codon usage among genes. These analyses need to be performed on properly normalized codon usage data to avoid biases masking this synonymous variation, i.e., gene length, amino acid usage, and codon degeneracy; however, previous studies have failed to do so. In this paper, we demonstrate that the use of alternative normalized data (called 'relative adaptiveness' in the literature) can avoid all these biases and furthermore, can identify more trends of variation among genes, including GC-ending codon usage, GT-ending codon usage, and gene expression level.

<ABSTRACT>
Migration, proliferation and death of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are important events in vascular pathology regulated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans and hence potentially by cell surface HS 6-O-endosulfatase1 (sulf1). Sulf1 mRNA expression was increased in cultured VSMC compared to rat aorta. Furthermore, adenovirus mediated overexpression of quail sulf1 decreased adhesion, and increased proliferation and apoptosis of VSMC. Overexpression of a dominant negative variant also decreased adhesion of VSMC and increased proliferation, apoptosis, migration and chemotaxis of VSMC. Our results imply that only normal levels of 6-O-sulfation maintained by sulf1 are optimal for several functions of VSMC.

<ABSTRACT>
Exposure of biological material to high levels of free radicals causes extensive cellular damage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by mitochondria have been associated with a variety of diseases and aging. We investigated the effect of low-level mitochondrial ROS production on newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins which are potentially vulnerable to mitochondrial ROS due to their location and unfolded state. We show that elevated mitochondrial ROS increases the degradation of newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins with some proteins more sensitive than others. In the long term reduced assembly of mitochondrial complexes would affect mitochondrial function and may trigger a vicious cycle of mitochondrial ROS production.

Sulfite facilitates LDL lipid oxidation by transition metal ions: a
pro-oxidant in wine?

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Lipid oxidation in LDL may play a role in atherogenesis. It has been shown that sulfite - a compound in the aqueous fraction of wine - could inhibit free radical (AAPH) mediated oxidation of plasma. Thus, sulfite has been proposed as an antioxidant. In contrast, the aqueous phase of wine has recently been shown to contain not fully identified compounds promoting transition metal ion (Cu(2+)) initiated LDL oxidation. As transition metal ions can catalyse the auto-oxidation of sulfite, we studied the influence of sulfite on Cu(2+) initiated LDL oxidation. The results show that sulfite at concentrations found in vivo strongly facilitated LDL oxidation by Cu(2+). The LDL-oxidase activity of ceruloplasmin was also stimulated by sulfite. ROS formation by Cu(2+)/SO(3)(2-) was not inhibited by SOD but by catalase. We propose that formation of Cu(+), sulfite radicals (SO(3)*(-)) and hydroxyl radicals (OH(*)) is a mechanism by which sulfite could act as a pro-atherogenic agent in presence of transition metal ions.

FADD deficiency sensitises Jurkat T cells to TNF-alpha-dependent necrosis
during activation-induced cell death.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 21;579(28):6465-72. Epub 2005 Nov 2.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Activation-induced cell death (AICD) in activated T lymphocytes is largely mediated by Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) interaction. The cytoplasmic adaptor molecule Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) plays an essential role in the apoptotic signalling of the Fas death pathway. In the present study, we observed that FADD deficient (FADD(-/-)) Jurkat T cells undergo AICD to a similar extent as wild-type cells. AICD in wild-type Jurkat T cells is via apoptosis, whereas it is non-apoptotic in FADD(-/-) cells. The latter took up propidium iodide, exhibit a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential and have no detectable cleavage products of caspase-8 or -3 activation, suggesting that these cells die by necrosis. Wild-type Jurkat T cells undergo apoptosis when incubated with recombinant FasL and Trail but not with TNF-alpha. In contrast, FADD(-/-) Jurkat T cells are resistant to FasL and Trail but die of necrosis when incubated with TNF-alpha. We showed that neutralising anti-TNF-alpha blocked AICD as well as TNF-alpha-induced necrosis in FADD(-/-) Jurkat T cells. Furthermore, down regulating the receptor interacting protein, RIP, with geldanamycin treatment, which is essential for TNF-alpha signalling, markedly inhibited AICD in FADD(-/-) Jurkat T cells. In addition, caspase-8-deficient Jurkat T cells are resistant to Fas- and TNF-alpha-induced cell death. Taken together, our results suggest that a deficiency in FADD and not caspase-8 or the inhibition of the Fas signalling pathway sensitises Jurkat T cells to TNF-alpha-dependent necrosis during AICD.

<ABSTRACT>
In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum isoprenoid precursors are synthesised inside a plastid-like organelle (apicoplast) by the mevalonate independent 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) pathway. The last reaction step of the DOXP pathway is catalysed by the LytB enzyme which contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster. In this study, LytB of P. falciparum was shown to be catalytically active in the presence of an NADPH dependent electron transfer system comprising ferredoxin and ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase. LytB and ferredoxin were found to form a stable protein complex. These data suggest that the ferredoxin/ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase redox system serves as the physiological electron donor for LytB in the apicoplast of P. falciparum.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 21;579(28):6403-10. Epub 2005 Nov 2.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates toxicity of environmental pollutants such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The exposure to AhR agonists results in profound suppression of cellular and humoral immune responses and compromises host to infectious disease. Therefore, to define the role of AhR in the immune response, spleen cells from ovalbumin (OVA)-immunized and naive mice were removed and stimulated in vitro with either OVA or mitogen concanavalin-A (Con A), respectively. Proliferation, CD19+, F4/80+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expansion and cytokines production were measured in C57BL/6-AhR-/- mice (AhR-/-) and compared with immune response in similarly immunized age-matched wild type (AhR+/+) mice. In response to OVA immunization, AhR-/- mice had similar levels of serum OVA-specific IgG2a, IgG1, and IgG2b compared with AhR+/+ animals. However, AhR-/- mice showed splenomegalia and an increase in B cells. No changes were observed on proliferation and IL-4 secretion, although AhR-/- cells produced more IFN-gamma and IL-12 than AhR+/+ cells. Similar results were observed with Con A stimulation, a decrease on IL-5 and no change on IL-2 secretion were observed on AhR-/- cells compared with AhR+/+ cells in response to Con A stimulation. High levels of IFN-gamma mRNA were detected in AhR-/- lymphocytes, but IL-4 mRNA levels in AhR-/- cells were similar to those in AhR+/+ mice. These data suggest that AhR may play an important role in the normal development and function of immune system by down-regulating IFN-gamma and IL-12 expression.

<ABSTRACT>
We investigated the interaction of oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) with the ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) pathway in J774 macrophages. Cellular efflux to apolipoprotein AI (apo-AI) of OxLDL-derived cholesterol was lower than efflux of cholesterol derived from acetylated low density lipoprotein (AcLDL). ABCA1 upregulation by 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cpt-cAMP) or 22 (R)-hydroxycholesterol (22-OH) and 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA) increased the efflux to apo-AI of cellular sterols derived from AcLDL, but not of those from OxLDL. AcLDL, but not OxLDL, induced ABCA1 protein content and activity in J774. However, OxLDL did not influence J774 ABCA1 upregulation by cpt-cAMP or 22-OH/9cRA. We conclude that sterols released to cells by OxLDL are available neither as substrate nor as modulator of ABCA1.

We have used DNase I footprinting to examine DNA triple helix formation at a 12 base pair oligopurine.oligopyrimidine sequence, using oligonucleotides that contain combinations of 2'-aminoethoxy-5-(3-aminoprop-1-ynyl)uridine (bis-amino-U, BAU) and 3-methyl-2-aminopyridine (MeP) in place of T and C, respectively. This combination acts cooperatively to enable high affinity triple helix formation at physiological pH. The affinity depends on the number of substitutions and their arrangement; oligonucleotides in which these analogues are evenly distributed throughout the third strand bind much better than those in which they are clustered together.

<ABSTRACT>
We have explored the existence of fusion- and secretion-competent sites on the plasma membrane of peptide secreting rat pituitary melanotrophs at rest, and following stimulation with glutamate. We monitored changes in fluorescence of FM1-43, a styryl dye which labels plasma membrane. The results show spontaneous local increases in FM1-43 reporting changes in membrane surface area due to cumulative exocytosis. Addition of glutamate, further increased the occurrence of these events. Statistical analysis of local FM1-43 fluorescence changes suggests that this is due to the recruitment of inactive exocytotic domains and due to the stimulation of already active exocytotic domains.

<ABSTRACT>
We focused on the functional involvement of transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) in transcriptional regulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in T cells. Costimulation of Jurkat cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and A23187 leads to a rapid phosphorylation of TAK1 and TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1), critical for TAK1 activation. A specific inhibitor of TAK1 blocked production of IL-2. In addition, overexpression of TAK1 and TAB1 induced secretion of IL-2. CD28-responsive element/activator protein-1-binding site (RE/AP) within the IL-2 promoter was a functional target for TAK1. The RE/AP-driven transcription was regulated by TAK1-mediated activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, p38 and IkappaB kinase. These results indicate that TAK1 plays a critical role in T cell activation by controlling production of IL-2.

What factor drives the fibrillogenic association of beta-sheets?

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The identification of the driving factor for fibril formation is paramount to understand the molecular basis of amyloidogenic disease. Recently, an atomic-detail structure of a fibrillogenic aggregate was reported and revealed a tight packing of beta-sheets. However, there is not a single pair-wise interaction of significance between the beta-sheets, no hydrogen bond and no hydrophobic interaction. Instead, there is extensive burial of polar groups at the interface. These observations lead to the question: What factor drives the association of beta-sheets? This issue is addressed by combining all-atom molecular dynamics with an implicit-solvent analysis. The driving force for the association arises from the mechanical equivalent of the dehydration propensity of pre-formed intra-sheet hydrogen bonds and dipole-dipole interactions.

<ABSTRACT>
Nucleoside diphosphate kinase from the halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum was crystallized in a free state and a substrate-bound form with CDP. The structures were solved to a resolution of 2.35 and 2.2A, respectively. Crystals with the apo-form were obtained with His6-tagged enzyme, whereas the untagged form was used for co-crystallization with the nucleotide. Crosslinking under different salt and pH conditions revealed a stronger oligomerization tendency for the tagged protein at low and high salt concentrations. The influence of the His6-tag on the halophilic nature of the enzyme is discussed on the basis of the observed structural properties.

Chiral bias of amyloid fibrils revealed by the twisted conformation of
Thioflavin T: an induced circular dichroism/DFT study.

<ABSTRACT>
Since it was implicated in a number of neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer disease, formation of beta-sheet-rich protein fibrils (amyloids) has been drawing a lot of attention. One of elusive aspects of amyloidogenesis concerns the mechanisms of specific binding of molecules such as Congo red, or Thioflavin T by amyloid fibrils. A comprehensive understanding of these docking interactions is needed, however, for the sake of furthering biochemical studies and developing molecular, pharmacological strategies preventing proliferation of amyloids in vivo. Through the application of circular dichroism, here we show that upon binding to insulin fibrils, a twisted conformation is enforced in molecules of Thioflavin T, manifested in a strong negative Cotton effect around 450 nm, which is supported by density functional theory-based calculations. This finding may lead to circular dichroism of Thioflavin T becoming a new diagnostic technique for protein fibrils, complementary to fluorescence spectroscopy.

Proteomic analysis of chlorosome-depleted membranes of the green sulfur
bacterium Chlorobium tepidum.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):217-32.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Green sulfur bacteria are obligate anaerobic phototrophs, which in addition to outer and plasma membranes contain chlorosomes. The analysis of the membrane proteome of Chlorobium tepidum from chlorosome-depleted membranes is described in this study. The membranes were purified by sucrose density centrifugation and characterized by 1-DE and 2-DE coupled with MS, absorption spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. 1-DE and 2-DE were employed to analyze the membrane proteins and to characterize the capabilities of the methods. Solubilization of the membrane proteins prior to 2-DE was improved by using a series of zwitterionic detergents. Based on the resolved spots after 2-DE, the combination of amidosulfobetaine 14 with Triton X-100 is more efficient than the combination of CHAPS, N-decyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propane sulfonate, and Triton X-100. From the application of 1-DE and 2-DE, 167 and 202 unique proteins were identified, respectively, using PMF by MALDI-TOF MS. Both methods resulted in the detection of 291 different proteins of which only 88 were predicted membrane proteins, indicating the limitation of membrane protein detection after separation with electrophoresis methods. In addition, 53 of these proteins were identified as outer membrane proteins.

Disulfide proteome yields a detailed understanding of redox regulations: a
model study of thioredoxin-linked reactions in seed germination.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):294-300.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Accumulating evidence suggests that redox regulations play important roles in a broad spectrum of biological processes. Recently, Yano et al. developed a disulfide proteome technique that comprehensively visualizes redox change in proteins. In this paper, using the disulfide proteome, we examined rice bran and identified fragments of embryo-specific protein and dienelactone hydrolase as putative targets of thioredoxin. Also, monitoring of the endogenous and recombinant effects of thioredoxin on rice bran proteins and supporting in vivo observations propose a mechanism of redox regulation in seed germination, in which thioredoxin activates cysteine protease with a concurrent unfolding of its substrate, the embryo-specific protein. Our findings suggest that thioredoxin controls the lifetime of specific proteins effectively by regulating the redox reactions coordinately. The model study demonstrates that the disulfide proteome technique is useful not only for identifying targets of thioredoxin, but also for clarify the detailed mechanism of redox regulation.

Proteome analysis of mitochondrial outer membrane from Neurospora crassa.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):72-80.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The mitochondrial outer membrane mediates numerous interactions between the metabolic and genetic systems of mitochondria and the rest of the eukaryotic cell. We performed a proteomic study to discover novel functions of components of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Proteins of highly pure outer membrane vesicles (OMV) from Neurospora crassa were identified by a combination of LC-MS/MS of tryptic peptide digests and gel electrophoresis of solubilized OMV proteins, followed by their identification using MALDI-MS PMF. Among the 30 proteins found in at least three of four separate analyses were 23 proteins with known functions in the outer membrane. These included components of the import machinery (the TOM and TOB complexes), a pore-forming component (porin), and proteins that control fusion and fission of the organelle. In addition, proteins playing a role in various biosynthetic pathways, whose intracellular location had not been established previously, could be localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Thus, the proteome of the outer membrane can help in identifying new mitochondria-related functions.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):16-25.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Current protein identification techniques are largely based on MALDI-TOF mass fingerprinting and LC-ESI MS/MS sequence tag analysis. Here we describe an improved method for rapid protein identification that uses direct infusion nanoelectrospray quadrupole time-of-flight (nanoESI QTOF) MS. Protein digests were analyzed without LC separation using nanoESI on a QSTAR XL MS/MS system in information dependent data acquisition mode. The protein identification conditions and parameters were extensively evaluated with in-solution and in-gel digested protein samples. Rapid identification of proteins was achieved and compared directly to the results obtained on the same samples using nanoflow HPLC-MS/MS on the QSTAR system. The increased throughput, reproducibility, the high data quality, and the ease of use make the direct infusion system an efficient and affordable technique for protein identification analysis.

Proteome profile changes that are differentially regulated by lipid and
protein phosphatase activities of tumor suppressor PTEN in PTEN-expressing
U-87 MG human glioblastoma cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):81-93.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The phosphatase and tensin homolog tumor suppressor (PTEN) belongs to a class of "gatekeeper" tumor suppressors together with p53, retinoblastoma and adenomatous polyposis. It is considered one of the most important tumor suppressors in the post p53 era. Previously to identify the molecules involved in the signaling network regulated by PTEN using proteomic tools, we reported global proteome profiles at different time points using the PTEN inducible NIH3T3 cells (Kim, S.-y., Kim, Y. S., Bahk, Y. Y., Mol. Cells 2003, 15, 396-405). However, the system had a critical limitation that NIH3T3 cell has endogenous wild-type PTEN and, thus to be exact, the induced PTEN could not give the answer about the real physiological roles of this tumor suppressor. Here, to find out PTEN-related protein network we have established various PTEN (wild-type, an activity inert C124G, and a lipid phosphatase deficient G129E)-expressing cell clones in U-87 MG human glioblastoma cells lacking detectable PTEN as a result of genetic lesions. In this biological context, we compared their morphological and expression patterns, and proteome images of each PTEN-expressing cell clone by 2-DE followed by identification with MALDI-TOF MS. We obtained some pieces of evidence that morphological change by PTEN expression is mediated by its protein phosphatase activity and their growth rate by the lipid phosphatase activity. The proteomic approaches showed that 30 proteins possibly correlated with PTEN's protein phosphatase activity (13 down-regulated and 17 up-regulated) and 20 with the lipid phosphatase activity (14 down-regulated and 6 up-regulated) were identified. Taken together, we conclude that the comparative analysis of proteome from various PTEN-expressing cells has yielded interpretable data to elucidate the protein network directly and/or indirectly caused by individual phosphatase activities of PTEN in vivo.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):349-63.

<ABSTRACT>
Proteome analysis by 2-DE and PMF by MALDI-TOF MS was performed on human amnion and amniotic fluid at term. Ninety-two soluble and nineteen membrane proteins were identified from amnion. Thirty-five proteins were identified from amniotic fluid. Calgranulin A and B were found in all patients infected with Ureaplasma urealyticum, but not in any of the patients without infection, indicating that they are potential markers of intrauterine infection. Identity of calgranulin A and B was confirmed by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. This study represents the first extensive analysis of the human amnion and amniotic fluid proteome at term and demonstrates that 2-DE and MALDI-TOF MS is a useful tool for identifying clinically significant biomarkers of problematic pregnancies.

Towards the proteome of Burkholderia cenocepacia H111: setting up a 2-DE
reference map.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):207-16.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Polyphasic-taxonomic studies of the past decade have shown that the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) comprises at least nine species, which share a high degree of 16S rDNA (98-100%) sequence similarity but only moderate levels of DNA-DNA hybridization. Members of the Bcc are well known as opportunistic pathogens of plants, animals and humans but also as biocontrol and bioremediation agents. In this study intra-, surface-associated and extracellular proteins of B. cenocepacia H111, which was isolated from a cystic fibrosis patient, were examined by 2-DE coupled to MALDI-TOF MS. MS and MS/MS data were searched against a database comprising all currently available annotated proteins of genetically closely related strains. In total 642 proteins spots were successfully identified corresponding to 390 different protein species, which were classified into functional categories. The majority of these proteins could be linked to housekeeping functions in energy production, amino acid metabolism, protein folding, post-translational modification and turnover, and translation. Noteworthy is the fact that a significant number of truly secreted and membrane proteins were identified in the extracellular and surface-associated sub-proteomes. This indicates that the pre-fractionation protocol used in this study is a highly valuable strategy for unravelling the cellular location of the identified proteins.

Detergent-free caveolae proteome suggests an interaction with ER and

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):143-52.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Recent proteomic studies of detergent resistant membrane fractions have begun to characterize the protein composition of caveolae and lipid rafts. The methods used in most of these studies, however, are not able to distinguish between plasma membrane and internal membrane lipid domains. Here we used a non-detergent method for obtaining fractions enriched in caveolae derived from the plasma membrane of multiple cell types. Unexpectedly, the proteins in the caveolae proteome suggest these lipid domains may interact with elements of ER and mitochondria. A comparison of the partial proteome we obtained with other published reports identifies 26 proteins that are candidate marker proteins for identifying caveolae in multiple cell types.

Nanostructures and molecular force bases of a highly sensitive capacitive
immunosensor.

Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4347-53.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
While biosensors have been constructed using various strategies, there is no report describing nanostructures of antibody-immobilized electrode interface in an immunosensor. Here, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrochemistry analyses were employed to construct and characterize the nanostructures and electrochemistry of biosensing surface that was created by a sequential self-assembling of bioactive aminobenzenthiol oligomer (o-ABT), glutareldehyde and anti-transferrin (anti-Tf) antibody on the electrode gold surface. Under AFM, a complete coverage of bioactive o-ABT interface could be achieved by anti-Tf antibody at an optimal concentration. The anti-Tf antibody immobilized on electrode surface of the immunosensor exhibited globular-shape topography with some degree of aggregation. Extensive force-curve analysis allowed mapping the functional spots of the anti-Tf immunosensor. Surprisingly, although immunosensing surface was fully covered by anti-Tf antibodies at the optimal concentration, only about 52% of coated anti-Tf antibody molecules (spots) on the electrode surface were able to specifically capture or bind Tf antigen under AFM. Despite limited functional spots, however, the anti-Tf immunosensor was highly specific and sensitive for sensitizing Tf antigen in solution. The anti-Tf molecules on the immunosensor exhibited a greater molecular force bound to holo-Tf (iron-containing form of Tf) than that to apo-Tf (iron-absent form of Tf). Consistently, the anti-Tf immunosensor had a greater electrochemical capacity to sensitize apo-Tf than holo-Tf, supporting the molecular force-based finding by AFM. Thus, the present study elucidated the nanostructures and molecular force bases for the immunosensing capacity of a highly sensitive capacitive immunosensor.

Enhanced phosphopeptide isolation by Fe(III)-IMAC using
1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4376-88.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
IMAC can be used to selectively enrich phosphopeptides from complex peptide mixtures, but co-retention of acidic peptides together with the failure to retain some phosphopeptides restricts the general utility of the method. In this study Fe(III)-IMAC was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed using a panel of phosphopeptides, both synthetic and derived from proteolysis of known phosphoproteins, to identify the causes of success and failure in the application of this technique. Here we demonstrate that, as expected, peptides with a more acidic amino acid content are generally more efficiently purified and detected by MALDI-MS after Fe(III)-IMAC than those with a more basic content. Modulating the loading buffer used for Fe(III)-IMAC significantly affects phosphopeptide binding and suggests that conformational factors that lead to steric hindrance and reduced accessibility to the phosphate are important. The use of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol is shown here to significantly improve Fe(III)-IMAC enrichment and subsequent detection of phosphopeptides by MALDI-MS.

<ABSTRACT>
Bacillus anthracis has always been an important pathogen because it can cause lethal inhalational anthrax, and may be used as a bioweapon or by bioterrorists. In this study, a 2-DE reference map and database of B. anthracis A16R was constructed. In total, 534 spots were processed, and 406 spots representing 299 proteins were identified. Gel-estimated pIs and molecular masses mostly matched well with their theoretical predictions, but some discrepancies also existed. Spot and protein corresponding analysis revealed that post-translational modifications might be common in B. anthracis. Through the MASCOT search, the similarity of B. anthracis, B. cereus and B. thuringiensis was further verified by protein level and a possible annotation error in B. anthracis strain Ames 0581 genome was found. Proteins of energy metabolism, fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism, protein synthesis, and cellular processes represented a large part of the most abundant proteins. At the same time, 27 hypothetical proteins were experimentally proved. There were 28 proteins also identified as spore composition in recently spore-related research, which indicated that they might play some roles in different phases such as growth, sporulation and outgrowth. Maps and information about all identified proteins are available on the Internet at http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE and http://www.proteomics.com.cn.

MS characterization of multiple forms of alpha-amylase in human saliva.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2005 Nov;5(17):4597-607.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Alpha-amylase is a major and well-characterized component of human saliva. Recent proteomic studies suggested that this protein could be observed in more than twenty spots on 2-D gels of salivary proteins. The aim of this work was to investigate this unexpected redundancy. 2-D gel electrophoresis was combined with systematic MALDI-TOF MS analysis. More than 140 protein spots identifying the alpha-amylase were shown to constitute a stable but very complex pattern. Careful analysis of mass spectra and simultaneous hierarchical clustering of the observed peptides and of the electrophoretic features of spots allowed one to define three major groups. A main class grouping 90 spots was shown to correspond to full length alpha-amylases that can be assumed to include isoforms and post-translationally modified forms, a subset of this class being demonstrated to be N-glycosylated. A second group included short alpha-amylases that are differently truncated in a non-random manner, very likely in the oral cavity. The last class grouped alpha-amylase forms showing both the N- and C-terminal sequences of the enzyme but displaying a molecular weight that was up to 50% lower than that of the native protein. It is speculated that the last group of alpha-amylase spots could correspond to proteins submitted to internal deletions prior to the secretion.

<ABSTRACT>
The side population (SP) phenotype is shared by stem cells in various tissues and species. Here we demonstrate SP cells with Hoechst dye efflux were surprisingly collected from the epithelia of both the rat limbus and central cornea, unlike in human and rabbit eyes. Our results show that rat limbal SP cells have a significantly higher expression of the stem cell markers ABCG2, nestin, and notch 1, compared to central corneal SP cells. Immunohistochemistry also revealed that ABCG2 and the epithelial stem/progenitor cell marker p63 were expressed only in basal limbal epithelial cells. These results demonstrate that ABCG2 expression is closely linked to the stem cell phenotype of SP cells.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Dec 5;579(29):6621-34. Epub 2005 Nov 9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Nucleophosmin (NPM)/B23 is a multifunctional protein, involving in a wide variety of basic cellular processes, including ribosome assembly, DNA duplication, nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, and centrosome duplication. It has previously been shown that NPM/B23 localizes to centrosomes, and dissociate from centrosomes upon phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin E. However, detail characterization of centrosomal association of NPM/B23 has been hampered by the lack of appropriate antibodies that efficiently detects centrosomally localized NPM/B23, as well as by apparent loss of natural behavior of NPM/B23 when tagged with fluorescent proteins. Here, by the use of newly generated anti-NPM/B23 antibody, we conducted a careful analysis of centrosomal localization of NPM/B23. We found that NPM/B23 localizes between the paired centrioles of unduplicated centrosomes, suggesting the role of NPM/B23 in the centriole pairing. Upon initiation of centrosome duplication, some NPM/B23 proteins remain at mother centrioles of the parental centriole pairs. We further found that inhibition of Crm1 nuclear export receptor results in both accumulation of cyclin E at centrosomes and efficient dissociation of NPM/B23 from centrosomes.

Endotoxin recognition: in fish or not in fish?
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Dec 5;579(29):6519-28. Epub 2005 Nov 9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The interaction between pathogens and their multicellular hosts is initiated by activation of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). These receptors, that include most notably members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family, recognize specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLR4 is a central part of the receptor complex that is involved in the activation of the immune system by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through the specific recognition of its endotoxic moiety (Lipid A). This is a critical event that is essential for the immune response to Gram-negative bacteria as well as the etiology of endotoxic shock. Interestingly, compared to mammals, fish are resistant to endotoxic shock. This in vivo resistance concurs with in vitro studies demonstrating significantly lowered sensitivity of fish leukocytes to LPS activation. Further, our in vitro analyses demonstrate that in trout mononuclear phagocytes, LPS fails to induce antiviral genes, an event that occurs downstream of TLR4 and is required for the development of endotoxic shock. Finally, an in silico approach that includes mining of different piscine genomic and EST databases, reveals the presence in fish of all of the major TLR signaling elements except for the molecules specifically involved in TLR4-mediated endotoxin recognition and signaling in mammals. Collectively, our analysis questions the existence of TLR4-mediated cellular responses to LPS in fish. We further speculate that other receptors, in particular beta-2 integrins, may play a primary role in the activation of piscine leukocytes by LPS.

<ABSTRACT>
The beta-glucan-binding protein (GBP) of soybean (Glycine max L.) has been shown to contain two different activities. As part of the plasma membrane-localized pathogen receptor complex, it binds a microbial cell wall elicitor, triggering the activation of defence responses. Additionally, the GBP is able to hydrolyze beta-1,3-glucans, as present in the cell walls of potential pathogens. The substrate specificity, the mode of action, and the stereochemistry of the catalysis have been elucidated. This defines for the first time the inverting mode of the catalytic mechanism of glycoside hydrolases belonging to family 81.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Dec 5;579(29):6564-8. Epub 2005 Nov 10.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The key step of N-glycosylation of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum is catalyzed by the hetero-oligomeric protein complex oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). It transfers the lipid-linked core-oligosaccharide to selected Asn-X-Ser/Thr-sequences of nascent polypeptide chains. Biochemical and genetic approaches have revealed that OST from Saccharomyces cerevisiae consists of nine subunits: Wbp1p, Swp1p, Stt3p, Ost1p, Ost2p, Ost4p, Ost5p, Ostp3 and Ost6p. By blue native polyacrylamide electrophoresis we show that yeast OST consists of two isoforms with distinct functions differing only in the presence of the two related Ost3 and Ost6p proteins. The OST6-complex was found to be important for cell wall integrity and temperature stress. Ost3p and Ost6p are not essential for OST activity, and can in part displace each other in the complex when overexpressed, suggesting a dynamic regulation of the complex formation.

Escherichia coli verotoxin 1 mediates apoptosis in human HCT116 colon
cancer cells by inducing overexpression of the GADD family of genes and S

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Dec 5;579(29):6604-10. Epub 2005 Nov 9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Escherichia coli verotoxin 1 (VT1) inhibits protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and damages endothelial cell in the hemolytic uremic syndrome. VT1 can specifically bind and act on endothelial cells as well as on many tumor cells because these cells express its high affinity receptor, globotriaosylceramide. This indicates that VT1 may have both antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities. We investigated this potential of VT1 by incubating several colon cancer cell lines with VT1 for different time periods and found that HCT116 cells were especially sensitive to VT1. A combination of morphological studies, flow cytometry, DNA laddering and annexin V staining confirmed that VT1 irreversibly arrests these cells in S phase within 24 h and prolonged incubation triggers DNA fragmentation. Concomitant to the activation of the S phase checkpoint, increased levels of mRNA and proteins of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene family that include GADD34, GADD45alpha, and GADD45beta was observed. Interestingly, no significant changes in expression of key cell cycle related proteins such as cdk2, cdk4, p21, p27, and p53 was found during the S phase arrest and apoptosis. We therefore suggest that GADD proteins might play an important role in VT1 induced S phase arrest and programmed cell death in HCT116 cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Major sites for Rho-kinase on the myosin phosphatase target subunit (MYPT1) are Thr695 and Thr850. Phosphorylation of Thr695 inhibits phosphatase activity but the role of phosphorylation at Thr850 is not clear and is evaluated here. Phosphorylation of both Thr695 and Thr850 by Rho-kinase inhibited activity of the type 1 phosphatase catalytic subunit. Rates of phosphorylation of the two sites were similar and efficacy of inhibition following phosphorylation was equivalent for each site. Phosphorylation of each site on MYPT1 was detected in A7r5 cells, but Thr850 was preferred by Rho-kinase and Thr695 was phosphorylated by an unidentified kinase(s).

<ABSTRACT>
IL-4 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, such as the induction of IgE synthesis and the development of mast cells. To further understand the effect of IL-4 on mast cells in skin, we utilized a mast cell/fibroblast co-culture system as an in vitro model of dermal mast cells. IL-4 induced mast cell growth in the culture with fibroblasts. Immunoblot analysis revealed that IL-4 activated Stat6 in both mast cells and fibroblasts. The over-expression of dominant-negative Stat6 in fibroblasts in the presence of IL-4 decreased the histamine content per mast cell, but not the number of mast cells. In contrast, the over-expression of constitutively-active Stat6 in fibroblasts increased the histamine content per mast cell, indicating that the activation of Stat6 in fibroblasts supports the maturation of mast cells co-cultured with fibroblasts.

Crystal structure of Escherichia coli SufA involved in biosynthesis of
iron-sulfur clusters: implications for a functional dimer.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2005 Dec 5;579(29):6543-8. Epub 2005 Nov 15.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
IscA and SufA are paralogous proteins that play crucial roles in the biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters, perhaps through a mechanism involving transient Fe-S cluster formation. We have determined the crystal structure of E. coli SufA at 2.7A resolution. SufA exists as a homodimer, in contrast to the tetrameric organization of IscA. Furthermore, a C-terminal segment containing two essential cysteine residues (Cys-Gly-Cys), which is disordered in the IscA structure, is clearly visible in one molecule (the alpha1 subunit) of the SufA homodimer. Although this segment is disordered in the other molecule (the alpha2 subunit), computer modeling of this segment based on the well-defined conformation of alpha1 subunit suggests that the four cysteine residues (Cys114 and Cys116 in each subunit) in the Cys-Gly-Cys motif are positioned in close proximity at the dimer interface. The arrangement of these cysteines together with the nearby Glu118 in SufA dimer may allow coordination of an Fe-S cluster and/or an Fe atom.

<ABSTRACT>
A vector for preparation of mouse polyomavirus capsid-like particles for transfer of foreign peptides or proteins into cells was constructed. Model pseudocapsids carrying EGFP fused with the C-terminal part of the VP3 minor protein (EGFP-VLPs) have been prepared and analysed for their ability to be internalised and processed by mouse cells and to activate mouse and human dendritic cells (DC) in vitro. EGFP-VLPs entered mouse epithelial cells, fibroblasts and human and mouse DC efficiently and were processed by both, lysosomes and proteasomes. Surprisingly, they did not induce upregulation of DC co-stimulation molecules or maturation markers in vitro; however, they did induce interleukin 12 secretion.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Synapses mediate communication between neurons, thus playing a fundamental role in information processing in the CNS. Neuroligins form a family of heterophilic synaptic cell adhesion molecules, and neuroligin 1 (NL1) has been shown to be involved in the formation of excitatory synapses and have been suggested to associate indirectly with NMDA receptors by common binding to PSD95. A mutation in neuroligin 3 (Arg451Cys-NL3, human sequence numbering) identified in autistic patients is associated with altered spine density and has reduced binding capacity for its presynaptic partner beta-neurexin. Here, we investigated the role of NL1 and the homologous NL1 mutation Arg473Cys-NL1 (R473C-NL1) in excitatory synaptic transmission and NMDA receptor distribution. We demonstrate that R473C-NL1, when expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons, can induce a dramatic increase in NMDA current amplitude and that this change is accompanied by NMDA receptor clustering in the postsynaptic cell.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Dec 5;579(29):6581-6. Epub 2005 Nov 9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A role for cytosolic malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) as a regulator of fatty acid oxidation has been postulated. However, there is no direct evidence that MCD is present in the cytosol. To address this issue, we performed cell fractionation and electron microscopic colloidal gold studies of rat liver to determine the location and activity of MCD. By both methods, substantial amounts of MCD protein and activity were found in the cytosol, mitochondria and peroxisomes, the latter with the highest specific activity. MCD species with different electrophoretic mobility were observed in the three fractions. The data demonstrate that active MCD is present in the cytosol, mitochondria and peroxisomes of rat liver, consistent with the view that MCD participates in the regulation of cytosolic malonyl-CoA levels and of hepatic fatty acid oxidation.

Proteomic analysis of fibrillin-rich microfibrils.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
MS has been used to investigate the composition of fibrillin-rich microfibrils from non-elastic and elastic tissues, and to compare fibrillin-1 tryptic fingerprints derived from whole zonules, microfibrils and recombinant fibrillin-1. In all microfibril preparations, fibrillin-1 was abundant and the only fibrillin isoform. MAGP-1 was the only other microfibril-associated molecule. gamma-Crystallin co-purified with zonular microfibrils, so this association may contribute to ciliary zonule anchorage to lens. Recombinant fibrillin-1 tryptic peptides mapped throughout the molecule and included virtually all predicted peptides except for those larger than 4.5 kDa, smaller than 600 Da or post-translationally modified. In contrast, fewer microfibril tryptic fibrillin-1 peptides were detected, although they were derived from domains throughout the molecule and included two peptides after the C-terminal furin processing site. Several microfibril-derived N- and C-terminal domains never yielded any peptides, while tryptic peptides from other domains yielded numerous peptides, suggesting that some tissue microfibril features are retained after trypsinisation. This first MS analysis of a purified extracellular matrix assembly has provided new insights into microfibril composition and fibrillin-1 organisation within them.

Low temperature-induced systems failure in Escherichia coli: insights from
rescue by cold-adapted chaperones.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):193-206.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The growth of Escherichia coli cells is impaired at temperatures below 21 degrees C and stops at 7.5 degrees C; however, growth of a transgenic strain producing the cold-adapted chaperones Cpn60 and Cpn10 from the psychrophilic bacterium Oleispira antarctica is good at low temperatures. The E. coli cpn(+) transgene offers a novel opportunity for examining the essential protein for cell viability at low temperatures. By screening a large-scale protein map (proteome) of cells of K-12 and its Cpn(+) transgene incubated at 4 degrees C, we identified 22 housekeeping proteins involved in systems failure of E. coli when confronted with low temperature. Through co-immunoprecipitation of Cpn60, Northern blot, and in vitro refolding, we systematically identified that protein-chaperone interactions are key determinants of their protein functions at low temperatures. Furthermore, chromosomal gene deletion experiments suggest that the mechanism of cold-induced systems failure in E. coli is cold-induced inactivation of the GroELS chaperonins and the resulting failure to refold cold-inactivated Dps, ClpB, DnaK and RpsB proteins. These findings: (1) indicate the potential importance of chaperones in cold sensitivity, cold adaptation and cold tolerance in cellular systems, and (2) suggest the identity of a few key cold-sensitive chaperone-interacting proteins that get inactivated and ultimately cause systems failure in E. coli cells at low temperatures.

Proteomic investigation of the molecular pathophysiology of
dysferlinopathy.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):379-85.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Mutations in dysferlin gene cause several types of muscular dystrophy in humans, including the limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and the distal muscular dystrophy of Miyoshi. The dysferlin gene product is a membrane-associated protein belonging to the ferlins family of proteins. The function of the dysferlin protein and the cause of deterioration and regression of muscle fibres in its absence, are incompletely known. A functional clue may be the presence of six hydrophilic domains, C2, that bind calcium and mediate the interaction of proteins with cellular membranes. Dysferlin seems to be involved in the membrane fusion or repair. Molecular diagnosis of dysferlinopathies is now possible and the types of gene alterations that have been characterized so far include missense mutations, deletions and insertions.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have undertaken a large scale study of the proteins expressed in the procyclic form of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African sleeping sickness, using 2-DE and MS. The complete data set encompasses over 2000 identifications, of which 770 are distinct proteins. We have discovered that multiple protein isoforms appear to be common in T. brucei, as most proteins have been matched to more than one gel spot. We have developed visualisation software to investigate the differences between isoforms, based on the information from the results of database searches with MS data. We are able to highlight instances where PTMs are the most likely cause of variant forms. In other cases, spots that appear reproducibly across replicates contain fragments of proteins, arising either as experimental artefacts or as part of protein degradation. We are also able to classify clusters of gel spots into different groups based on the pattern of peptides that have been matched from MS data. The entire data set is stored within a relational database system that allows complex queries ( http://www.gla.ac.uk/functionalgenomics). Using specific proteins as examples, we demonstrate how the visualisation software and the database query facilities can be used.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):233-50.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Reference maps of the cytosolic, cell surface and extracellular proteome fractions of the amino acid-producing soil bacterium Corynebacterium efficiens YS-314 were established. The analysis window covers a pI range from 3 to 7 along with a molecular mass range from 10 to 130 kDa. After second-dimensional separation on SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, computational analysis detected 635 protein spots in the cytosolic proteome fraction, whereas 76 and 102 spots were detected in the cell surface and extracellular proteomes, respectively. By means of MALDI-TOF-MS and tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting, 164 cytosolic proteins, 49 proteins of the cell surface and 89 extracellular protein spots were identified, representing in total 177 different proteins. Additionally, reference maps of the three cellular proteome fractions of the close phylogenetic relative Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 were generated and used for comparative proteomics. Classification according to the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins scheme and abundance analysis of the identified proteins revealed species-specific differences. The high abundance of molecular chaperones and amino acid biosynthesis enzymes in C. efficiens points to environmental adaptations of this recently discovered amino acid-producing bacterium.

Proteomic studies support the use of multi-product immunoassays to monitor
host cell protein impurities.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):94-110.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In the biopharmaceutical industry, recombinant protein drugs are commonly produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. During the development process, removal of CHO cell-derived proteins from the biopharmaceutical product is monitored using multi-product immunoassays. Such immunoassays are developed by raising antibodies to a single CHO cell protein preparation. However, these assays are utilized to monitor CHO cell protein impurities during the recovery of products from different CHO cell lines. To address whether underlying differences between CHO cell lines result in sufficient protein expression changes to exclude the suitability of multi-product immunoassays, a comparative proteomics study of three independently generated CHO cell lines was performed. Statistical analysis of over 1000 proteins resolved by 2-D PAGE demonstrated that the protein expression profiles of three different CHO cell lines exhibit very few differences in protein expression. Only 11 qualitative changes in protein expression and 26 quantitative changes greater than two-fold were observed. Identification of protein spots by mass spectrometry revealed that many of the observed changes were due to post-translational modifications rather than expression of novel proteins in each cell line. These results suggest that multi-product immunoassays are suitable for monitoring host cell proteins in biopharmaceuticals produced in different CHO cell lines.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):41-53.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
MS protein identification and quantitation are key proteomic techniques in biological research. Besides identification of proteins, MS is used increasingly to characterize secondary protein modifications. This often requires trimming the analytical strategy to a specific type of modification. Direct analysis of protein modifications in proteomic samples is often hampered by the limited dynamic range of current analytical tools. Here we present a fast, sensitive, multiplexed precursor ion scanning mode--implemented on a quadrupole-TOF instrument--that allows the specific detection of any modified peptide or molecule that reveals itself by a specific fragment ion or pattern of fragment ions within a complex proteomic sample. The high mass accuracy of the TOF mass spectrometer is available for the marker ion specificity and the precursor ion mass determination. The method is compatible with chromatographic separation. Fragment ions and intact molecular ions are acquired quasi-simultaneously by continuously switching the collision energy between elevated and low levels. Using this technique many secondary modifications can be analyzed in parallel; however, the number of peptides carrying a specific modification that can be analyzed successfully is limited by the chromatographic resolution or, more generally, by the depth of the resolved time domain.

2-D protein maps of rat gastrocnemius and soleus muscles: a tool for
muscle plasticity assessment.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):321-40.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Functional characterization of muscle fibers relies on ATPase activity and on differential measurements of metabolic proteins, including mitochondrial and glycolytic enzymes, glucose, lactate and lactic acid transporters, calcium cycling proteins and components of the contractile machinery. The recent introduction of microarray technology has enabled detailed gene expression studies under different physiological and pathological conditions, thus generating novel hypotheses on muscle function. However, microarray approaches are limited by the incomplete genome coverage of currently available chips, and by poor correlation between mRNA concentration and protein expression level. We have used 2-DE and MS to build a reference map of proteins from rat mixed gastrocnemius and soleus muscle, and to assess qualitative and quantitative differences in protein distribution between these two functionally dissimilar muscles. More than 800 spots on each gel were detected by silver staining, of which 167 were excised, digested in-gel with trypsin and analyzed by ESI-MS/MS. One hundred and twenty eight distinct gene products were identified, including metabolic, transport and contractile proteins. Forty one spots displayed differences in relative expression level between mixed gastrocnemius and soleus samples. These data not only enable differentiation of functionally distinct slow-twitch and fast-twitch fiber types, but also provide tools for investigating muscle plasticity in response to physiological and environmental conditions such as aging or hypoxia.

<ABSTRACT>
Although gemcitabine is a potent therapeutic agent in the treatment of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), resistance to gemcitabine is common. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in acquired gemcitabine resistance against NSCLC cells. Gemcitabine-resistant NSCLC H1299 cells (H1299/GR) were selected by long-term exposure of parental H1299 cells to gemcitabine. The median inhibitory concentrations of gemcitabine in H1299 and H1299/GR cells were 19.4 and 233.1 nM, respectively. Gemcitabine induced activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) in parental H1299 cells but not in H1299/GR cells after 48 h. Blocking JNK activation by pretreatment with SP600125, a specific JNK inhibitor, or by transfection with dominant-negative JNK vectors abrogated gemcitabine-induced apoptosis in parental H1299 cells as evidenced by interruption of caspase activation. Transient transfection with a JNKK2-JNK1 plasmid expressing constitutive JNK1 partially restored the effect of gemcitabine in H1299/GR cells. Our results indicate that gemcitabine-induced apoptosis in human NSCLC H1299 cells requires activation of the JNK signaling pathway. Attenuated JNK activation may contribute to development of acquired gemcitabine resistance in cancer cells.

<ABSTRACT>
Functional evidence indicates that voltage-dependent Ca2+ (Cav) channels participate in sea urchin sperm motility and the acrosome reaction (AR), however, their molecular identity remains unknown. We have identified transcripts for two Ca2+ channel alpha1 subunits in sea urchin testis similar in sequence to Cav1.2 and Cav2.3. Antibodies against rat Cav1.2 and Cav2.3 channels differentially label proteins in the flagella and acrosome of mature sea urchin sperm. The Cav channel antagonists nifedipine and nimodipine, which inhibit the AR, diminish the intracellular Ca2+ elevation induced by a K+-induced depolarization in valinomycin-treated sperm. These findings reveal that Cav1.2 and Cav2.3 channels could participate in motility and/or the AR in sea urchin sperm.

<ABSTRACT>
We report here a computationally fast protocol for predicting binding affinities of non-metallo protein-ligand complexes. The protocol builds in an all atom energy based empirical scoring function comprising electrostatics, van der Waals, hydrophobicity and loss of conformational entropy of protein side chains upon ligand binding. The method is designed to ensure transferability across diverse systems and has been validated on a heterogenous dataset of 161 complexes consisting of 55 unique protein targets. The scoring function trained on a dataset of 61 complexes yielded a correlation of r=0.92 for the predicted binding free energies against the experimental binding affinities. Model validation and parameter analysis studies ensure the predictive ability of the scoring function. When tested on the remaining 100 protein-ligand complexes a correlation of r=0.92 was recovered. The high correlation obtained underscores the potential applicability of the methodology in drug design endeavors. The scoring function has been web enabled at as binding affinity prediction of protein-ligand (BAPPL) server.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Dec 5;579(29):6673-80. Epub 2005 Nov 17.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Myopodin is an actin bundling protein that shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm in response to cell stress or during differentiation. Here, we show that the myopodin sequence 58KKRRRRARK66, when tagged to either enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or to enhanced cyan fluorescent protein-CapG (ECFPCapG), is able to target these proteins to the nucleolus in HeLa or HEK293T cells. By contrast, 58KKRR61-ECFP-CapG accumulates in the nucleus. Mutation of 58KKRRRRARK66 into alanine residues blocks myopodin nuclear import and promotes formation of cytoplasmic actin filaments. A second putative nuclear localization sequence, 612KTSKKKGKK620, displays much weaker activity in a heterologous context, and appears not to be functional in the full length protein. Thus myopodin nuclear translocation is dependent on a monopartite nuclear localization sequence.

<ABSTRACT>
The ability to introduce non-natural amino acids into proteins opens up new vistas for the study of protein structure and function. This approach requires suppressor tRNAs that deliver the non-natural amino acid to a ribosome associated with an mRNA containing an expanded codon. The suppressor tRNAs must be absolutely protected from aminoacylation by any of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in the protein synthesizing system, or a natural amino acid will be incorporated instead of the non-natural amino acid. Here, we found that some tRNAs with non-standard structures could work as efficient four-base suppressors fulfilling the above orthogonal conditions. Using these tRNAs, we successfully demonstrated incorporation of three different non-natural amino acids into a single protein.

<ABSTRACT>
Staurosporine and four staurosporine derivatives were docked on the rhodopsin-based homology model of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in order to localize the possible allosteric sites of this receptor. It was found that there were three major allosteric sites, two of which are located at the extracellular face of the receptor, and one in the intracellular domain of the receptor. In the present study, the localization of these binding sites is described for the first time. The present study confirms the existence of multiple allosteric sites on the M1 muscarinic receptor, and lays the ground for further experimental and computational analysis to better understand how muscarinic receptors are modulated via their allosteric sites. These findings will also help to design and develop novel drugs acting as allosteric modulators of the M1 receptor, which can be used in the treatment of the Alzheimer's disease.

FEBS Lett. 2005 Dec 19;579(30):6749-55. Epub 2005 Nov 21.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Understanding the molecular mechanism of host-pathogen interactions is the basis for drug design and vaccine development. The fine composition of mycolic acids (MA), the major constituents of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cell envelope, as well as other cell wall-associated lipids, contribute to determine the virulence of a given strain. However, endogenous receptors for mycolic acids on susceptible cells exposed to mycobacterial infections have not been fully identified. Here, we show that galectin-3, a multifunctional beta-galactoside binding lectin present mainly in the cytoplasm of inflammatory cells and also present on the cell surface, can recognize mycobacterial mycolic acids. MA can inhibit the lectin self-association but not its carbohydrate-binding abilities and can selectively interfere in the interaction of the lectin with its receptors on temperature-sensitive dendritic cell line, suggesting that galectin-3 could be involved in the recognition of trafficking mycolic acids and participate in their interaction with host cells.

The pro-apoptotic properties of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) structural proteins were studied in vitro. By monitoring apoptosis indicators including chromatin condensation, cellular DNA fragmentation and cell membrane asymmetry, we demonstrated that the adenovirus-mediated over-expression of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein and its C-terminal domain (S2) induce apoptosis in Vero E6 cells in a time- and dosage-dependent manner, whereas the expression of its N-terminal domain (S1) and other structural proteins, including envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein do not. These findings suggest a possible role of S and S2 protein in SARS-CoV induced apoptosis and the molecular pathogenesis of SARS.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) affects migration of vascular endothelial cells. 5-HT significantly enhanced migration of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), and this enhancement was completely inhibited by GR 55562, a 5-HT1 receptor antagonist, and fluoxetine, a 5-HT transporter inhibitor, but was not affected by ketanserin, a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. 5-HT stimulation increased RhoA and ERK activity of HAECs, and inhibitors of RhoA (Y-27632 and H-1152) and inhibitors of MEK (U0126 and PD98059) abolished the 5-HT-induced increase in migration velocity. Inhibition of Rho kinase by Y-27632 blocked stress fiber formation and rear release of HAECs. Thus, 5-HT has a potent enhancing action on migration of HAECs through activating the RhoA and ERK pathways following 5-HT1 receptor stimulation.

<ABSTRACT>
The crystal structure of winged bean basic agglutinin in complex with GalNAc-alpha-O-Ser (Tn-antigen) has been elucidated at 2.35 angstroms resolution in order to characterize the mode of binding of Tn-antigen with the lectin. The Gal moiety occupies the primary binding site and makes interactions similar to those found in other Gal/GalNAc specific legume lectins. The nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the acetamido group of the sugar make two hydrogen bonds with the protein atoms whereas its methyl group is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. A water bridge formed between the terminal oxygen atoms of the serine residue of the Tn-antigen and the side chain oxygen atom of Asn128 of the lectin increase the affinity of the lectin for Tn-antigen compared to that for GalNAc. A comparison with the available structures reveals that while the interactions of the glyconic part of the antigen are conserved, the mode of stabilization of the serine residue differs and depends on the nature of the protein residues in its vicinity. The structure provides a qualitative explanation for the thermodynamic parameters of the complexation of the lectin with Tn-antigen. Modeling studies indicate the possibility of an additional hydrogen bond with the lectin when the antigen is part of a glycoprotein.

<ABSTRACT>
Beta amyloid (Abeta) is believed one of the major pathogens of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the reduction of Abeta is considered a primary therapeutic target. Immunization with Abeta can reduce Abeta burden and pathological features in transgenic AD model mice. Transgenic potato plants were made using genes encoding 5 tandem repeats of Abeta1-42 peptides with an ER retention signal. Amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice (Tg2576) fed with transgenic potato tubers with adjuvant showed a primary immune response and a partial reduction of Abeta burden in the brain. Thus, Abeta tandem repeats can be expressed in transgenic potato plants to form immunologically functional Abeta, and these potatoes has a potential to be used for the prevention and treatment of AD.

<ABSTRACT>
The SARS-CoV open reading frame 6 (ORF6) is transcribed into mRNA6 and encodes a putative 7.5 kDa accessory protein, SARS 6, with unknown function. In this study, we have confirmed the SARS 6 protein expression in lung and intestine tissues of the SARS patients and in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells by immunohistochemistry. Further studies by immunoblot and confocal microscopy analyses revealed the expression and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization of the recombinant SARS 6 protein in mammalian cells. Expression of SARS 6 protein in mammalian cells elicits biological activity of stimulating cellular DNA synthesis.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Opacities (cataracts) in the lens of the eye are a leading cause of preventable blindness. Aquaporins function as water channels, and the C-terminus is postulated as a regulatory domain. The C-terminal domain of aquaporin 0 (AQP0) develops numerous truncation sites during lens aging. The purpose of the present experiment was to determine if the calcium-activated protease m-calpain (EC 3.4.22.17) was responsible for truncation of human AQP0. AQP0 was isolated from young human donors, incubated with recombinant m-calpain, and the cleavage sites on the released peptides were determined by on-line electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. We found that four cleavage sites on human AQP0 could be tentatively assigned to m-calpain. This is the first evidence for possible calpain activity in human lens. Because the cause(s) of 17 other cleavage sites was unknown, the data also suggested that other, as yet unknown, proteases or non-enzymatic mechanisms are more active than calpain in human lens.

<ABSTRACT>
Here, we report that in the obligate aerobic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, a protein exhibiting rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase) activity is associated with proton pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I). Complex I is a key enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain that contains eight iron-sulfur clusters. From a rhodanese deletion strain, we purified functional complex I that lacked the additional protein but was fully assembled and displayed no functional defects or changes in EPR signature. In contrast to previous suggestions, this indicated that the sulfurtransferase associated with Y. lipolytica complex I is not required for assembly of its iron-sulfur clusters.

<ABSTRACT>
The nuclear receptor constitutive active/androstane receptor CAR is a drug-sensing transcription factor. Upon activation by various drugs such as phenobarbital (PB), CAR translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to regulate the genes that encode enzymes and proteins involved in hepatic metabolism. Here, we have shown the presence of CAR at the cell membrane of mouse livers, using Car+/+ and Car-/- mice. Levels of the cell membrane CAR increased after PB treatment. The CAR exists as a large approximately 160 kDa complex. Thus, CAR undergoes PB-induced translocation to the cell membrane, indicating that CAR may exert a non-genomic action.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have established a spontaneously immortalized chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cell line (SC-1) that has been in continuous culture for more than three years. This is only the second report of a spontaneously immortalized reverse transcriptase (RT)-negative chicken cell line. The SC-1 cells emerged from crisis (at about passage 29-31) with a slower growth rate than primary cells. Passage 50 SC-1 cells expressed similar levels of p53 mRNA, but slightly lower levels of p53 protein than passage 6 CEF cells. By passage 120, p53 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in the SC-1 cells, while protein levels were slightly increased compared to passage 6 CEF cells. However, functional analysis of p53 revealed reduced activity in later passage SC-1 cells. Other p53-related genes including p21WAF1, p27Kip1, MDM-2, and the p16INK4a alternate reading frame (ARF) sequence showed similar patterns of differential mRNA expression. Levels of p15INK4b mRNA and protein were dramatically decreased in SC-1 cells, suggesting that the Rb pathway also has been compromised. Telomerase expression was undetectable in SC-1 cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed that SC-1 and primary cells contained a similar proportion of G0/G1 phase cells, unlike the only other spontaneously immortalized chicken cell line (DF-1). The present study suggests that alterations in the p53 and Rb pathways cause fluctuations in expression levels of important cell-cycle regulatory genes during crucial transition periods as the SC-1 spontaneously immortalized chicken fibroblast cells progress toward becoming a fully committed cell line.

Valproic acid (VPA), an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug, has been reported to exert neuroprotection against a variety of insults. We now show that VPA attenuates rotenone (a potent complex I inhibitor)-induced apoptosis through the induction of heat shock protein 70, which may interact with apoptotic-protease-activating factor 1. Activation of p-Akt, p-Bcl-2, as well as p-Erk1/2 by VPA may be co-contributors to the protection.

Ligand-independent orphan receptor TR2 activation by phosphorylation at
the DNA-binding domain.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):123-30.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In a previous report we demonstrated protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of orphan nuclear receptor TR2. In this report, we provide the evidence of PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of TR2. Two PKC target sites were predicted within the DBD, at Ser-170 and Ser-185, but only Ser-185 was confirmed by MS. Phosphorylation of DBD facilitated DNA binding of the TR2 receptor and its recruiting of coactivator p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF). Ser-185 was required for DNA binding, whereas both Ser-170 and Ser-185 were necessary for receptor interaction with P/CAF. The P/CAF-interacting domain of TR2 was located in its DBD. A double mutant (Ser-170 and Ser-185) of TR2 significantly lowered the activation of its target gene RARbeta2. This study provides the first evidence for ligand-independent activation of TR2 orphan receptor through PTM at the DBD, which enhanced its DNA-binding ability and interaction with coactivator P/CAF.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):172-80.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Moraxella catarrhalis is a major mucosal pathogen of the human respiratory tract both in children and in adults. Two subpopulations of this organism have been described that differ in 16S rRNA gene sequence and virulence traits. Three 16S rRNA types have been defined. 2-DE followed by protein identification by MS revealed significant differences in the outer membrane protein (OMP) patterns of each M. catarrhalis 16S rRNA type. Approximately 130 features were detected on the 2-DE map of each M. catarrhalis 16S rRNA type. However, only 50 features were expressed by all strains. Furthermore, direct profiling of isolated OMP using MALDI-TOF MS resulted in a characteristic spectral fingerprint for each 16S rRNA type. Fingerprints remained identical when intact cells instead of isolated OMP were analyzed. This finding suggests that the source of desorbed ions is the outer membrane. Based on the fingerprint we were able to assign 18 well-characterized clinical M. catarrhalis isolates to the correct subpopulation. Therefore, MALDI-TOF of intact M. catarrhalis provides a rapid and robust tool for M. catarrhalis strain typing that could be applied in epidemiological studies.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):268-81.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The now finished genome sequence of Bacillus licheniformis DSM 13 allows the prediction of the genes involved in protein secretion into the extracellular environment as well as the prediction of the proteins which are translocated. From the sequence 296 proteins were predicted to contain an N-terminal signal peptide directing most of them to the Sec system, the main transport system in Gram-positive bacteria. Using 2-DE the extracellular proteome of B. licheniformis grown in different media was studied. From the approximately 200 spots visible on the gels, 89 were identified that either contain an N-terminal signal sequence or are known to be secreted by other mechanisms than the Sec pathway. The extracellular proteome of B. licheniformis includes proteins from different functional classes, like enzymes for the degradation of various macromolecules, proteins involved in cell wall turnover, flagellum- and phage-related proteins and some proteins of yet unknown function. Protein secretion is highest during stationary growth phase. Furthermore, cells grown in complex medium secrete considerably higher protein amounts than cells grown in minimal medium. Limitation of phosphate, carbon and nitrogen sources results in the secretion of specific proteins that may be involved in counteracting the starvation.

Ubiquitous cancer genes: multipurpose molecules for protein micro-arrays.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):67-71.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Multipurpose genes in the human genome which are over-expressed in a large variety of different cancers have been identified. Forty-two of the 19,016 human genes annotated to date (0.2%) are ubiquitously over-expressed in half or more of the 36 investigated human cancers. Of these genes, 15 are involved in protein biosynthesis and folding, six of them in glycolysis. A group of 13 solid tumours over-express almost all (39-42 of 42) ubiquitous cancer genes, suggesting a common mechanism underlying these cancers. Others, such as endocrine cancers, have only a few over-expressed ubiquitous cancer genes. The proteins for which these genes code or the corresponding antibodies are candidates for small protein microarrays aiming at maximum information with only a limited number of proteins. Since the over-expression pattern varies from cancer to cancer, distinction between different cancer classes is possible using one single set of protein or antibody molecules.

<ABSTRACT>
Chronic infection of hepatitis virus B (HBV) has been proven to be one of the most important risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBx has been shown to function in the viral life cycle and the development of HCC. Recently, we have reported that HBx transgenic mice (p21-HBx), generated by gene knockin, develop HCC at the age of 18 months. To further study the function of HBx during the development of HCC in vivo, we performed proteomic analysis of the transgenic and wild-type control mice. The combination of 2-DE and MALDI-TOF MS revealed that proteasome subunits (PSMA6, PSMB4, PSMC2 and PSMD12) were up-regulated in tumor tissues of the p21-HBx transgenic mice. Cathepsin B, ubiquinol-cytochrome C reductase core protein 1 and an ATP-dependent caseinolytic protease, which were involved in the cellular proteolytic process, were also found increased in tumors. The results were confirmed in tumors of transgenic mice and HCCs of human using RT-PCR. All these results suggested that the strengthened ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosomal pathway might contribute to the development of HBx-related HCC.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(2):420-6.

<ABSTRACT>
Based on array CIEF (ACIEF) and a novel whole column imaging detection (WCID), a comprehensive 2-D system with laser-induced fluorescence was developed for protein mapping. By coupling capillary RPLC (CRPLC) as the first dimension and ACIEF as the second dimension, a high-throughput and high-resolution proteomic expression profiling was obtained. An array of up to 60 capillaries was assembled, with electrical connections made through filling small breaks, created on each capillary at positions of buffer reservoirs, with a porous polymer. A whole column image system with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) was devised. Spot excitation was performed with a laser converted to produce linear light, and a CCD camera was employed to take images of the protein fluorescence during line laser scanning of the capillary array. Quantitative detection of thousands of focusing protein bands in the capillary array was achieved. Details on the capillary array fabrication and scanning LIF detection system devices are discussed. The efficiency of this CRPLC-ACIEF-LIF-WCID system was further demonstrated using samples of soluble proteins extracted from liver cancer tissue. The overall peak capacity was estimated to be around 18 000 in an analysis time of less than 3 h. The reproducibility of consecutive runs and different columns were assessed as having an RSD of 1.5% and 2.2% in focusing positions, respectively.

Multi-modality of pI distribution in whole proteome.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(2):449-55.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Multi-modality of pI distribution is a common feature in different whole proteomes. Some researchers considered it relate to the proteins with different subcellular locations, indicating the result of natural selection. We explored the pI distribution of predicted proteomes (including animals, plants, bacterium, archaeans) and random proteome [random protein sequences constructed according to the special amino acid composition and molecular weight (MW) distribution of human predicted proteome]. Our results suggest that the multi-modality is the result of discrete pK(R) values for different amino acids. Amino acid composition and MW distribution of a proteome also contributes to the specific pI distribution. Although protein subcellular location was related to pI value, our analyses revealed that comparing with the random proteome, neither the multi-modality phenomenon nor the distribution bias of pI values is caused by subcellular location. It seems that the multi-modality distribution is just a mathematical fun. The blank region near the neutral pI was caused by the absence of amino acids with neutral pK(R), and suggests that the selection of amino acids with ionizable side chain might be restricted by the requirement for a special pH environment during the origin of life. From this point of view, the special distribution was the result of natural selection.

<ABSTRACT>
High-throughput screens have begun to reveal protein interaction networks in several organisms. To understand the general properties of these protein interaction networks, a systematic analysis of topological structure and robustness was performed on the protein interaction networks of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. It shows that the three protein interaction networks have a scale-free and high-degree clustering nature as the consequence of their hierarchical organization. It also shows that they have the small-world property with similar diameter at 4-5. Evaluation of the consequences of random removal of both proteins and interactions from the protein interaction networks suggests their high degree of robustness. Simulation of a protein's removal shows that the protein interaction network's error tolerance is accompanied by attack vulnerability. These fundamental analyses of the networks might serve as a starting point for further exploring complex biological networks and the coming research of "systems biology".

<ABSTRACT>
Chronic infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) is closely correlated with serious liver diseases. Although considerable progress has been made during recent years, the mechanism of replication and pathogenesis of HCV infection are still elusive. We have applied proteomic techniques in this work to globally analyze the protein expression profiles of a human liver cell lines Huh7 in absence and presence of HCV replication, aiming at elucidating the components of HCV replication and the cellular responses to HCV replication. The protein mixtures of three subcellular fractions from Huh7 and Huh7-HCV were separated by 2-DE under various pH gradients. Differentially expressed spots were identified by MALDI-TOF MS, followed by database searching. A total of 179 comparative proteins were identified unambiguously, including proteins associated with host cytoskeleton, intracellular traffic, oxidative and ER stress, proteasome degradation, translation, apoptosis, proliferation, etc. Host proteins known to interact with HCV proteins, such as HSP27, alpha-actinin, nucleolin and eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-I, were elevated in Huh7-HCV cells. Our study provides the global information of proteomic alteration of Huh7 cells in the presence of HCV replication and the clues for further understanding of the mechanism of HCV replication and pathogenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
We and other investigators have previously shown that estrogen and androgen have synergistic effects on the growth of mammary epithelial ducts and alveoli in the Noble mouse. However, the molecular mechanisms behind the synergy are unknown. In the present study, we treated female FVB mice with 17-estrodial (E2) and 5-dihydrotestosterone-bezonate (DHT-B) using slow-releasing hormone pellets for 7 months. Dissection showed that hormone treatment caused atypical hyperplasia of mammary ducts and alveoli. A functional proteomic approach was used to study the holistic protein changes in mammary glands. 2-DE was used to separate proteins. Twenty-five protein spots that were differentially expressed in hormone-treated tissues compared to the control were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS, and ESI-quadrupole-TOF-MS, which include some proteins that are correlative with response to estrogen and androgen stimulation, cells differentiation and growth, signal transduction, metabolism, etc. Real-time RT-PCR was carried out to verify the different expression. These results offered some clues to understand the function of E2 and DHT-B.

<ABSTRACT>
Here, we show that extracorporeal shock waves (ESW), at a low energy density value, quickly increase neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity and basal nitric oxide (NO) production in the rat glioma cell line C6. In addition, the treatment of C6 cells with ESW reverts the decrease of nNOS activity and NO production induced by a mixture of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) plus tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Finally, ESW treatment efficiently downregulates NF-kappaB activation and NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression, including inducible NOS and TNF-alpha. The present report suggests a possible molecular mechanism of the anti-inflammatory action of ESW treatment.

<ABSTRACT>
Insects have evolved chitin-containing structures such as the cuticle or peritrophic membranes that serve to protect their bodies against the hostile environment. The specific mechanisms by which these structures are produced, are mostly unknown. We have identified a novel multigene family, the obstructor family, which encodes ten putatively secreted chitin-binding proteins that are characterized by a stereotype arrangement of a N-terminal signaling peptide and 3 chitin-binding-domains. Gene expression studies in Drosophila melanogaster embryos demonstrate that obstructor family members are expressed in cuticle forming tissues. Using computational and phylogenetic analysis, we show that obstructor genes represent an evolutionary conserved multigene family in invertebrates.

<ABSTRACT>
Actin cytoskeletal reorganization and membrane trafficking are important for spine morphogenesis. Here we investigated whether the small GTPase, ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), which regulates actin dynamics and peripheral vesicular trafficking, is involved in the regulation of spine formation. The developmental expression pattern of ARF6 in mouse hippocampus was similar to that of the post-synaptic density protein-95, and these molecules colocalized in mouse hippocampal neurons. Overexpression of a constitutively active ARF6 mutant in cultured hippocampal neurons decreased the spine density, whereas a dominant-negative ARF6 mutant increased the density. These results demonstrate a novel function for ARF6 as a key regulator of spine formation.

<ABSTRACT>
Hypotaurocyamine kinase (HTK) is a member of the highly conserved family of phosphagen kinases that includes creatine kinase (CK) and arginine kinase (AK). HTK is found only in sipunculid worms, and it shows activities for both the substrates hypotaurocyamine and taurocyamine. Determining how HTK evolved in sipunculids is particularly insightful because all sipunculid-allied animals have AK and only some sipunculids have HTK. We determined the cDNA sequence of HTK from the sipunculid worm Siphonosoma cumanense for the first time, cloned it in pMAL plasmid and expressed it in E. coli as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein. The cDNAderived amino acid sequence of Siphonosoma HTK showed high amino acid identity with molluscan AKs. Nevertheless, the recombinant enzyme of Siphonosoma HTK showed no activity for the substrate arginine, but showed activity for taurocyamine. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of HTK and AK indicated that the amino acid residues necessary for the binding of the substrate arginine in AK have been completely lost in Siphonosoma HTK sequence. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the HTK amino acid sequence was placed just outside the molluscan AK cluster, which formed a sister group with the arthropod and nematode AKs. These results suggest that Siphonosoma HTK evolved from a gene for molluscan AK. Moreover, to confirm this assertion, we determined by PCR that the gene for Siphonosoma HTK has a 5-exon/4-intron structure, which is homologous with that of the molluscan AK genes. Further, the positions of splice junctions were conserved exactly between the two genes. Thus, we conclude that Siphonosoma HTK has evolved from a primordial gene for molluscan AK.

Adiponectin inhibits Toll-like receptor family-induced signaling.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2005 Dec 19;579(30):6821-6. Epub 2005 Nov 28.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Recent studies have shown that adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived cytokine, acts as a potent inhibitor of inflammatory responses. It has been also demonstrated that bacterial and viral signalings in host cells are triggered via Toll-like receptor (TLR) molecules. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether globular adiponectin (gAd) would be able to inhibit TLR-mediated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling in mouse macrophages (RAW264). gAd predominantly bound to the AdipoR1 receptor and suppressed TLR-mediated NF-kappaB signaling. gAd-mediated inhibition of TLR-mediated IkappaB phosphorylation and NF-kappaB activation was eliminated by the pretreatment of cycloheximide. Also their inhibitions of gAd were blocked by preincubation of the cells with an antibody against AdipoR1, but not with an antibody against AdipoR2. Taken together, these findings indicate that adiponectin negatively regulates macrophage-like cell response to TLR ligands via an unknown endogenous product(s).

The isolated catalytic hairpin of the Ras-specific guanine nucleotide

FEBS Lett. 2005 Dec 19;579(30):6851-8. Epub 2005 Nov 28.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cdc25Mm is a mammalian Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). By homology modeling we show that it shares with Sos-GEF the structure of the putative catalytic HI hairpin where the dominant negative T1184E mutation is located. Similarly to Cdc25MmT1184E, the isolated wild-type and mutant hairpins retain the ability to displace Ras-bound nucleotide, originate a stable Ras/GEF complex and downregulate the Ras pathway in vivo. These results indicate that nucleotide re-entry and Ras/GEF dissociation--final steps in the GEF catalytic cycle--require GEF regions different from the HI hairpin. GEF down-sizing could lead to development of novel Ras inhibitors.

<ABSTRACT>
The ABC-transporter HlyB is a central element of the Type I protein secretion machinery, dedicated to export the E. coli toxin HlyA in a single step across the two membranes of the cell envelope. Here, we discuss recent insights into the structure and the mechanism of ATP-hydrolysis by the NBD of HlyB. Combining structural and biochemical data, we have suggested that substrate-assisted catalysis (SAC), but not general base catalysis, is responsible for ATP-hydrolysis in this NBD and might also operate in other NBDs. Finally, the implications and advantages of SAC are discussed in the context of ATP-induced dimerization of the NBDs.

Promiscuity in the part-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway of the

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus metabolises glucose and galactose by a 'promiscuous' non-phosphorylative variant of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, in which a series of enzymes have sufficient substrate promiscuity to permit the metabolism of both sugars. Recently, it has been proposed that the part-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway occurs in parallel in S. solfataricus as an alternative route for glucose metabolism. In this report we demonstrate, by in vitro kinetic studies of D-2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG) kinase and KDG aldolase, that the part-phosphorylative pathway in S. solfataricus is also promiscuous for the metabolism of both glucose and galactose.

<ABSTRACT>
A murine lung alveolar carcinoma cell line (WT-Line 1) and its equally tumorigenic but non-malignant derivative transduced with a dominant negative inhibitor of NF-kappaB (mI-kappaB-Line 1), were profiled on the Affymetrix 19000 gene array platform. Two differentially expressed gene clusters were identified and integrated into a functional model. The downregulation of anti-oxidant defenses, in mI-kappaB-Line 1 cells, correlates with high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS damage to cellular macromolecules while the upregulation of metabolic nuclear receptors correlates with an adaptive/survival response, which involves a shift in energy metabolism toward beta-oxidative respiration. Accordingly, mI-kappaB-Line 1 cells are markedly sensitized to pharmacologic inhibition of beta-oxidative respiration. These findings are indicative of compensatory changes that could undermine anti-cancer therapies targeting NF-kappaB.

<ABSTRACT>
Internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements allow simultaneous synthesis of multiple proteins in eukaryotic cells. Here, two unrelated IRESs that perform efficiently in bicistronic constructs, the picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and the cellular immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) IRES, were used to generate a tricistronic vector. Functional analysis of the tricistronic RNA evidenced that the efficiency of protein synthesis under the control of BiP IRES was lower than that of the FMDV IRES, relative to the efficiency measured in bicistronic vectors. A specific competition between these elements was verified using two separate mono- or bicistronic constructs in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, no interference was detected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES. The interference effect of FMDV IRES was observed in cis and trans, in support of competition for common transacting factors different than those used in cap- and HCV-dependent initiation.

<ABSTRACT>
Caloric restriction (CR) is the most compelling example of lifespan extension by external manipulation. Although the molecular mechanisms remain unknown, the theory of hormesis has been invoked to explain the life promoting effects of CR. Hormesis is defined as the beneficial effects of low intensity stressor on a cell or organism. Mrg19 is a putative transcription factor that regulates carbon and nitrogen metabolism in yeast. In this study, we have found that deletion of MRG19 gene causes metabolic shift in yeast cells, leading to higher intracellular reactive oxygen species, augmentation of scavenging enzymes and longer lifespan compared to wild-type cells. All these results together suggest that similar to CR, depletion of Mrg19 leads to a condition of mild stress which in turn enhances vitality.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Glutamate 5-kinase (G5K) catalyzes the controlling first step of the synthesis of the osmoprotective amino acid proline, which feed-back inhibits G5K. Microbial G5K generally consists of one amino acid kinase (AAK) and one PUA (named after pseudo uridine synthases and archaeosine-specific transglycosylases) domain. To investigate the role of the PUA domain, we have deleted it from Escherichia coli G5K. We show that wild-type G5K requires free Mg for activity, it is tetrameric, and it aggregates to higher forms in a proline-dependent way. G5K lacking the PUA domain remains tetrameric, active, and proline-inhibitable, but the Mg requirement and the proline-triggered aggregation are greatly diminished and abolished, respectively, and more proline is needed for inhibition. We propose that the PUA domain modulates the function of the AAK domain, opening the way to potential PUA domain-mediated regulation of G5K; and that this domain moves, exposing new surfaces upon proline binding.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Enhanced hepatic levels of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) may play a key role in the pathogenesis of some liver diseases because CYP2E1 represents a significant source of reactive oxygen species. Although a large fraction of CYP2E1 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, CYP2E1 is also present in mitochondria. In this study, we asked whether ethanol, a known inducer of microsomal CYP2E1, could also increase CYP2E1 within mitochondria. Our findings indicated that ethanol increased microsomal and mitochondrial CYP2E1 in cultured rat hepatocytes and in the liver of lean mice. This was associated with decreased levels of glutathione, possibly reflecting increased oxidative stress. In contrast, in leptin-deficient obese mice, ethanol administration did not increase mitochondrial CYP2E1, nor it depleted mitochondrial glutathione, suggesting that leptin deficiency hampers mitochondrial targeting of CYP2E1. Thus, ethanol intoxication increases CYP2E1 not only in the endoplasmic reticulum but also in mitochondria, thus favouring oxidative stress in these compartments.

<ABSTRACT>
Patch-clamp experiments revealed that near isogenic ET8 (Al-tolerant) and ES8 (Al-sensitive) wheat cultivars differed significantly in slow vacuolar channel properties. Under control conditions, whole vacuole currents displayed faster deactivation in ES8. Application of 1.4 microM vacuolar Al3+ caused a 20 mV increase in the activation threshold and slowed activation kinetics in ET8 but not in ES8. Channel density was about 30% higher in ES8 than ET8, and was not altered by 24 h aluminium pre-treatment. However, the activation threshold was reduced in Al-pre-treated ES8. Overall, our data suggests that Alt1 locus may control more than the plasma membrane malate channel in wheat.

<ABSTRACT>
The three-dimensional structures of the alpha-sarcin ribotoxin and its delta(7-22) deletion mutant, both complexed with a 20-mer oligonucleotide mimicking the sarcin/ricin loop (SRL) of the ribosome, have been docked into the structure of the Halobacterium marismortui ribosome by fitting the nucleotide atomic coordinates into those of the ribosomal SRL. This study has revealed that two regions of the ribotoxin, residues 11-16 and 84-85, contact the ribosomal proteins L14 (residues 99-105) and L6 (residues 88-92), respectively. The first of these two ribotoxin regions appears to be crucial for its specific ribosome recognition.

<ABSTRACT>
The Escherichia coli ATP-dependent protease Lon degrades ribosomal S2 protein in the presence of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP). In this study, the process of the degradation was investigated in detail. During the degradation, 68 peptides with various sizes (4-29 residues) were produced in a processive fashion. Cleavage occurred at 45 sites, whose P1 and P3 positions were dominantly occupied by hydrophobic residues. These cleavage sites were located preferentially at the regions with rigid secondary structures and the P1 residues of the major cleavage sites appeared to be concealed from the surface of the substrate molecule. Furthermore, polyP changed not only the substrate preference but also the oligomeric structure of the enzyme.

<ABSTRACT>
In plants, the ABC transporter PDR (pleiotropic drug resistance) subfamily is composed of approximately 15 genes, few of which have been analyzed. We have identified NtPDR3, a Nicotiana tabacum PDR gene belonging to a cluster for which no functional data was previously available. NtPDR3 was found to be induced in suspension cells treated with methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, 1-naphthalene acetic acid, or cembrene, a macrocyclic diterpene. In agreement with the identification of a putative iron deficiency element in the NtPDR3 transcription promoter region, we found that iron deficiency in the culture medium induced NtPDR3 expression, thus suggesting a new function of the PDR transporter family.

<ABSTRACT>
The objective of this study was to identify and characterize a "biomarker of toxicity" from the proteome of Alexandrium tamarense, a paralytic shellfish toxin (PST)-producing dinoflagellate. A combination of 2-DE and MS approaches was employed to identify proteins of interest in the vegetative cells of several strains of A. tamarense with different toxin compositions and from different geographical locations. The electrophoretic analysis of the total water-soluble proteins from these toxic strains by 2-DE showed that several abundant proteins, namely AT-T1, AT-T2 and AT-T3, differing slightly in apparent Mr and pIs, were consistently present in all toxic strains of A. tamarense. Further analysis by MALDI-TOF MS and N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that they are isoforms of the same protein. Even more intriguing is that these proteins in A. tamarense have similar amino acid sequences and are closely related to a "biomarker of toxicity" previously reported in A. minutum. Unambiguous and highly species-specific identification was later achieved by comparing the PMFs of proteins in these two species. An initial attempt to characterize these proteins by generation of murine polyclonal antibodies against the AT-T1 protein was successful. Western blot analysis using the murine AT-T1-polycolonal antibodies identified all the toxic strains of A. tamarense and A. minutum, but not the nontoxic strain of A. tamarense. These results indicate that these protein characteristics for toxic strains are species-specific and that they are stable properties of the tested algae which are clearly distinguishable irrespective of geographical location and toxin composition. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the use of polyclonal antibodies against marker proteins purified from 2-DE gels to distinguish different strains and species of the PST-producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium. It provides the basis for the production of monoclonal antibody probes against the "biomarkers of toxicity" for those dinoflagellates whose genome is incompletely characterized. Potentially, immunoassays could be developed to detect the presence of toxic algae in routine monitoring programs as well as to predict bloom development and movement.

<ABSTRACT>
Proteome analysis of Jurkat T cells induced to undergo apoptosis by CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) treatment was performed to identify modified proteins. We used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) using leucine to identify proteins of apoptotic and control Jurkat T cells by 2-DE and MALDI-MS. Out of 224 spots analyzed, we quantified 213 spots with 3.5 leucine-containing peptide pairs on average; 28 proteins with a relative abundance of higher than 1.5 were found. Five new modified proteins including calcyclin binding protein, cytosolic acyl coenzyme A thioester hydrolase, heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein M, replication factor C 37-kDa subunit, and tropomyosin 4 chain were identified as being modified in response to apoptosis. In comparison to differential proteome analysis via silver-stained 2-D gels and PMF of total Jurkat T cell lysates, 15 additional apoptosis-modified proteins were identified though 8 proteins were not found. The described approach using SILAC instead of silver staining for relative quantification was simpler to perform regarding the number of required 2-D gels, that cumbersome gel comparisons were avoided, and more apoptosis-modified proteins were identified, but with a higher demand on data interpretation of the mass spectra obtained.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(2):632-40.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Geobacter sulfurreducens, generally considered to be a strict anaerobe, is a predominant microbe in subsurface environments, where it utilizes available metals as electron acceptors. To better understand the metabolic processes involved in the metal-reduction capability of this microbe, the proteins expressed by cells grown anaerobically with either fumarate or ferric citrate as electron acceptor were compared. Proteins were separated by 2-DE under denaturing or nondenaturing conditions, and proteins varying in abundance with a high level of statistical significance (p<0.0001) were identified by peptide mass analysis. Denaturing 2-DE revealed significant differences in the relative abundance of the membrane proteins OmpA and peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein, several metabolic enzymes, and, in addition, superoxide dismutase and rubredoxin oxidoreductase. Nondenaturing 2-DE revealed elevated catalase in cells grown with ferric citrate. These results suggest that, in addition to adjustments in membrane transport and specific metabolic pathways in response to these two different electron acceptors, distinct differences exist in the oxidative environment within the cell when fumarate or soluble ferric citrate is provided as electron acceptor. Although an anaerobe, G. sulfurreducens appears to have alternate mechanisms for dealing with reactive oxygen species in response to increased intracellular soluble iron.

Pedigree analysis of an elite rice hybrid using proteomic approach.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(2):474-86.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The definition of dominance or epistasis is generally on the basis of a descriptive characterization for these crops in the field, such as yield per hectare and the weight of grain. Since these trait examinations lack molecular information, how to precisely predict the phenotypic changes in filial generation is still a problem in heterosis studies. For rice, the genetic information caused by hybridization can be archived through analyzing of proteomes of rice seeds. Differential analysis of proteomes was introduced for the rice seeds of three cultivars, 9311, PA64S and LYP9, an elite rice hybrid from cross between 9311 and PA64S. In the three rice endosperms, the expression profiles of proteins were similar with the stained spots of 47 +/- 1, 46 +/- 0.6 and 44 +/- 0.6, for 9311, PA64S and LYP9, respectively; however, the number of proteins expressed in the rice embryos was significantly increased with the stained spots of 395.3 +/- 12.9, 350 +/- 9.2, and 389.3 +/- 16.4, for 9311, PA64S and LYP9, respectively. Importantly, the image comparisons and protein identifications have revealed in significantly different embryo protein spots among the three rice cultivars. By carefully analyzing these different 2-DE spots, many of them from the three embryos were shown to display a mirrored relationships between parents and the first filial generation. Furthermore, all of stained spots in LYP9 embryo were found on the 2-DEs from its parents, indicating that there was a genetic linkage. These results suggest that proteomic approach is able to serve pedigree analysis and functional prediction for new rice breeds.

Microwave-assisted specific chemical digestion for rapid protein

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(2):586-91.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have developed a rapid microwave-assisted protein digestion technique based on classic acid hydrolysis reaction with 2% formic acid solution. In this mild chemical environment, proteins are hydrolyzed to peptides, which can be directly analyzed by MALDI-MS or ESI-MS without prior sample purification. Dilute formic acid cleaves proteins specifically at the C-terminal of aspartyl (Asp) residues within 10 min of exposure to microwave irradiation. By adjusting the irradiation time, we found that the extent of protein fragmentation can be controlled, as shown by the single fragmentation of myoglobin at the C-terminal of any of the Asp residues. The efficacy and simplicity of this technique for protein identification are demonstrated by the peptide mass maps of in-gel digested myoglobin and BSA, as well as proteins isolated from Escherichia coli K12 cells.

Inflammatory protein profile during systemic high dose interleukin-2

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Systemic interleukin-2 (IL-2) administration induces an assortment of downstream effects whose biological and therapeutic significance remains unexplored mostly because of the methodological inability to globally address their complexity. Protein array analysis of sera from patients with renal cell carcinoma obtained prior and during high-dose IL-2 therapy had previously revealed extensive alterations in expression of the soluble factors analyzed, whose discovery was limited by the number of capture antibodies selected for protein detection. Here, we expanded the analysis to SELDI-TOF-MS and quantitative protein analysis (nephelometry). All cytokines/chemokines detected by protein arrays were below the SELDI detection limit, while novel IL-2-specific changes in expression of acute-phase reactants and high-density lipoprotein metabolites could be identified. Serum amyloid protein A (SAA) and C-reactive protein expression were consistently up-regulated after four doses of IL-2, while other proteins were down-regulated. These findings were confirmed by SELDI immunoaffinity capture and nephelometry. Immunoaffinity capture revealed different, otherwise undetectable, isoforms of SAA. A linear correlation between peak area by SELDI and protein concentration by nephelometry was observed. Overall distinct yet complementary information was obtained using different platforms, which may better illustrate complex phenomena such as the systemic response to biological response modifiers.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A versatile, multidimensional, and non-denaturing proteome separation procedure using microplate technology is presented, yielding a digitized image of proteome composition. In the first dimension, the sample under study is separated into 96 fractions by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). In the second dimension, the fractions of the first dimension are transferred by the liquid-handling device CyBi-Well (CyBio AG, Jena, Germany) to 96 parallel anion exchange chromatography columns. In this way the proteins are conserved in their native states and are distributed in 2400 liquid fractions with high recovery rates and sufficient reproducibility. The resulting fractions are subjected to protein quantitation and identification. Spectrophotometrical and immunological methods and enzyme activity measurements are used for quantitation. To identify proteins, the fractions are subjected to MALDI-MS, and their tryptic digests to both MALDI- and LC-ESI-MS/MS. All preparation steps except the first are applied in parallel to sets of multiples of 96 samples. The procedure may be refined by adding more separation steps and may be adapted to various protein amounts and to various proteomes. Moreover, the method offers the opportunity to investigate functional protein complexes. The method was applied to separate the normal human serum proteome. Within 255 fractions exhibiting the highest protein concentrations, 742 proteins were identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS peptide sequence tags.

Detection of gender differences in rat lens proteins using 2-D-DIGE.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(2):667-76.

<ABSTRACT>
The glass-like transparency of the human eye lens is achieved by the tight packing of abundant crystallin proteins. However, the precise role of the accessory non-crystallin proteins is not well understood. We have carried out 2-DE mapping of these proteins in rat lens. This showed the presence of the high molecular weight filamentous structural proteins spectrin, filensin, tubulin, vimentin, actin and phakinin as well as several forms of potential crystallin oligomers comprised of alphaA, betaB1, betaA1 and betaA4 chains. Other proteins that were present include, heat shock protein 71, WD repeat protein 1, and several enzymes including alpha-enolase, pyruvate kinase, transketolase and aldose reductase. 2-D-DIGE analysis revealed several expression differences between the lens proteomes of male and female rats. Female rat lenses contained lower levels of aldose reductase, increased proteolyic fragments of the structural proteins filensin, vimentin and phakinin and higher levels of potential alphaA, betaB1 and betaA1 crystallin oligomers. Taken together these findings suggest that there are potential differences in oxidative stress regulation between male and female rat lenses, which may have implications on susceptibility to cataract formation. Future studies aimed at elucidating pre-cataractic changes in the non-crystallin proteins described here may facilitate identification of novel markers involved in cataractogenesis.

Phosphopeptide detection using automated online IMAC-capillary
LC-ESI-MS/MS.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(2):404-11.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
IMAC has become a commonly used technique in phosphoprotein analysis because of its affinity for phosphopeptides. However, the commonly used strategy combining offline IMAC enrichment with desalting procedures prior to MS/MS makes this method laborious. Here we report the development of a robust and automatic IMAC-capillary RP HPLC-ESI MS/MS technology platform, by which all procedures needed in phosphopeptide analysis including IMAC enrichment, RP HPLC separation and nanospray MS/MS can be done automatically controlled by the MassLynx program. The platform was optimized by analyzing standard phosphopeptide, and was then applied to the identification of phosphorylation sites of recombinant human telomeric repeat binding factor 1 treated with kinase in vitro, and two phosphorylation sites are defined.

<ABSTRACT>
A novel ATPase activity that was strongly activated in the presence of either cobalt or manganese ion was discovered in the chaperonin from hyperthermophilic Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu-cpn). Surprisingly, a significant ADPase activity was also detected under the same conditions. A more extensive search revealed similar nucleotide hydrolysis activities in other thermostable chaperonins. Chaperonin activity, i.e., thermal stabilization and refolding of malate dehydrogenase from the guanidine-hydrochloride unfolded state were also detected for Pfu-cpn under the same conditions. We propose that the novel cobalt/manganese-dependent ATP/ADPase activity may be a common trait of various thermostable chaperonins.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A proteomics approach was used to search for novel phospholipid binding proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Phospholipids were immobilized on a solid support and the lipids were probed with soluble yeast protein extracts. From this, the phosphatidic acid binding proteins were eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. Thirteen proteins were identified and 11 of these were previously unknown lipid binding proteins. The protein-lipid interactions identified would not have been predicted using bioinformatics approaches as none possessed a known lipid binding motif. A subset of the identified proteins was purified to homogeneity and determined to directly bind phospholipids immobilized on a solid support or organized into liposomes. This simple approach could be systematically applied to perform an exhaustive screen for soluble lipid binding proteins in S. cerevisiae or other organisms.

<ABSTRACT>
In the present study, we characterized regions of human heat shock protein (HSP) 60 responsible for binding to primary macrophages. Studies using 20-mer peptides of the HSP60 sequence to compete with HSP60-binding to macrophages from C57BL/6J mice showed that regions aa241-260, aa391-410 and aa461-480 are involved in surface-binding. HSP60 mutants, lacking the N-terminal 137, 243 or 359 amino acids, inhibited HSP60-binding to primary macrophages to different degrees, demonstrating that all three regions are required for optimal binding. Analysis of different pro- and eukaryotic HSP60 species indicated that phylogenetically separate HSP60 species use different binding sites on primary macrophages.

<ABSTRACT>
The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) is a key factor of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation pathway. This ABC transporter translocates peptides derived mainly from proteasomal degradation from the cytosol into the ER lumen for loading onto MHC class I molecules. Manifold mechanisms have evolved to regulate TAP activity. During infection, TAP expression is upregulated by interferon-gamma. Furthermore, the assembly and stability of the transport complex is promoted by various auxiliary factors. However, tumors and viruses have developed sophisticated strategies to escape the immune surveillance by suppressing TAP function. The activity of TAP can be impaired on the transcriptional or translational level, by enhanced degradation or by inhibition of peptide translocation. In this review, we briefly summarize existing data concerning the regulation of the TAP complex.

Common antigenicity for two glycosidases.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has proven to be an effective therapy for some lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) patients. A potential complication during ERT is the generation of an immune response against the replacement protein. We have investigated the antigenicity of two distantly related glycosidases, alpha-glucosidase (Pompe disease or glycogen storage disease type II, GSD II), and alpha-L-iduronidase (Hurler syndrome, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, MPS I). The linear sequence epitope reactivity of affinity purified polyclonal antibodies to recombinant human alpha-glucosidase and alpha-L-iduronidase was defined, to both glycosidases. The polyclonal antibodies exhibited some cross-reactive epitopes on the two proteins. Moreover, a monoclonal antibody to the active site of alpha-glucosidase showed cross-reactivity with a catalytic structural element of alpha-L-iduronidase. In a previous study, in MPS I patients who developed an immune response to ERT, this same site on alpha-L-iduronidase was highly antigenic and the last to tolerise following repeated enzyme infusions. We conclude that glycosidases can exhibit cross-reactive epitopes, and infer that this may relate to common structural elements associated with their active sites.

The ABC of auxin transport: the role of p-glycoproteins in plant
development.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2006 Feb 13;580(4):1094-102. Epub 2005 Dec 6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A surprising outcome of the Arabidopsis genome project was the annotation of a large number of sequences encoding members of the ABC transporter superfamily, including 22 genes encoding the p-glycoprotein (PGP) subfamily. As mammalian PGP orthologs are associated with multiple drug resistance, plant PGPs were initially presumed to function in detoxification, but were soon seen to have a developmental role. Here, we summarise recent studies of plant PGPs indicating that PGPs mediate the cellular and long-distance transport of the plant hormone auxin. One class of PGPs, represented by AtPGP1, catalyze auxin export, while another class with at least one member, AtPGP4, appears to function in auxin import. Current models on the physiological role of PGPs, their functional interaction and their involvement in cell-to cell (polar) auxin transport are discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
Although molecular dynamics simulations are an important tool for studying membrane systems, relatively few simulations have used anionic lipids. This paper reports the first simulation of a pure phosphatidylglycerol (PG) bilayer. The properties of this equilibrated palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol membrane agree with experimental observations of PG membranes and with previous simulations of monolayers and mixed bilayers containing PG lipids. These simulations also provide interesting insights into hydrogen bonding interactions in PG membranes. This equilibrated membrane will be a useful starting point for simulations of membrane proteins interacting with PG lipids.

<ABSTRACT>
Bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha L. produces C22 very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (VLCPUFA). Thus far, no enzyme that mediates elongation of C20 VLCPUFAs has been identified in land plants. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of the gene MpELO2, which encodes an ELO-like fatty acid elongase in M. polymorpha. Heterologous expression in yeast demonstrated that MpELO2 encodes delta5-elongase, which mediates elongation of arachidonic (20:4) and eicosapentaenoic acids (20:5). Phylogenetic and gene structural analysis indicated that the MpELO2 gene is closely related to bryophyte Delta6-elongase genes for C18 fatty acid elongation and diverged from them by local gene duplication.

Differences in catalytic activity between rat testicular and ovarian
carbonyl reductases are due to two amino acids.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 9;580(1):67-71. Epub 2005 Dec 6.

<ABSTRACT>
The sequences of rat testis carbonyl reductase (rCR1) and rat ovary carbonyl reductase (rCR2) are 98% identical, differing only at amino acids 140, 141, 143, 235 and 238. Despite such strong sequence identity, we find that rCR1 and rCR2 have different catalytic constants for metabolism of menadione and 4-benzoyl-pyridine. Compared to rCR1, rCR2 has a 20-fold lower K(m) and 5-fold lower k(cat) towards menadione and a 7-fold lower K(m) and 7-fold lower k(cat) towards 4-benzoyl-pyridine. We constructed hybrids of rCR1 and rCR2 that were changed at either residues 140, 141 and 143 or residues 235 and 238. rCR1 with residues 140, 141 and 143 of rCR2 has similar catalytic efficiency for menadione and 4-benzoyl-pyridine as rCR1. rCR1 with Thr-235 and Glu-238 of rCR2 has the catalytic constants of rCR2, indicating that it is this part of rCR2 that contributes to its lower K(m) for menadione and 4-benzoyl-pyridine. Comparisons of three-dimensional models of rCR1 and rCR2 show how Thr-235 and Glu-238 stabilize rCR2 binding of NADPH and menadione.

Hansenula polymorpha and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pex5p's recognize
different, independent peroxisomal targeting signals in alcohol oxidase.

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 9;580(1):46-50. Epub 2005 Dec 6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Peroxisomal alcohol oxidase (AO) from Hansenula polymorpha is inactive and partially mislocalized to the cytosol upon synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Co-production with H. polymorpha pyruvate carboxylase (HpPyc1p) resulted in AO activation, but did not improve import into peroxisomes. We show that import of AO mediated by S. cerevisiae Pex5p is strictly dependent on the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) of AO and independent of HpPyc1p. In contrast, HpPex5p-mediated sorting of AO into S. cerevisiae peroxisomes is independent of the PTS1, but requires an alternative PTS that is only formed when HpPyc1p is co-produced and most likely involves folding and co-factor binding to AO.

<ABSTRACT>
Macrophage ionotropic P2X7 receptors regulate cell-death through ill-defined signaling pathways. Here, we investigated the role of ceramide, an apoptogenic sphingolipid and showed that ATP stimulated ceramide accumulation in macrophages. Benzoylbenzoyl-ATP, a potent P2X7 agonist, was able to mimic the effects of ATP on ceramide accumulation while oxidized ATP had the opposite effect. Ceramide accumulation was blocked by de novo ceramide biosynthesis inhibitors. Interestingly, ATP-induced caspase-3/7 activation was dependent on ceramide generation. Finally, we showed that de novo ceramide biosynthesis is involved in ATP-induced macrophage death in a caspase-dependent manner. Our results indicate a novel role of ceramide in P2X7-regulated cell-death.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Ribosome-bound trigger factor (TF) is the first chaperone encountered by a nascent polypeptide chain in bacteria. TF has been proposed to form a cradle-shaped shield for nascent chains up to approximately 130 residues to fold in a protected environment upon exit from the ribosome. We report that nascent chains of luciferase up to 280 residues in length are relatively protected by TF against digestion by proteinase K. In contrast, nascent chains of the constitutively unstructured protein alpha-synuclein were not protected, although they were in close proximity to TF by crosslinking. Thus, TF is not a general shield for nascent chains. Protease protection appears to depend on a hydrophobic interaction of TF with nascent polypeptides.

<ABSTRACT>
Osteoblastic differentiation is an essential part of bone formation. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a water miscible solvent that is used extensively for receptor ligands in osteoblast studies. However, little is known about its effects on osteoblastogenic precursor cells. In this study, we have used a murine preosteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 cells to demonstrate that DMSO effectively induces osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells via the activation of Runx2 and osterix and is dependent upon the protein kinase C (PKC) pathways. We further demonstrated that prolonged activation of PKC pathways is sufficient to induce osteoblastic differentiation, possibly via the activation of PKD/PKCmu.

<ABSTRACT>
Musashi-1 is involved in maintenance of neural stem cells. In the rat stomach, we found some cells in the luminal compartment of the mucosa that stained positively for Musashi-1. These cells were distinct from other cells of epithelial lineage, except for parietal cells, and coexpressed HES5. The Musashi-1-positive cells exfoliated after damage, while Musashi-1 expression in neck cells were upregulated, and proliferating cells diminished before reappearing and increasing in number thereafter. We conclude that a subpopulation of parietal cells acts as a source of Musashi-1, which contributes to rapid re-epithelization by restoration of stem cells and regulation of cell differentiation.

<ABSTRACT>
Proteolytic post-translational modification has been proposed as an early stage event in the aggregation of tau protein and formation of neurofibrillary lesions in Alzheimer's disease. Caspases and other proteases cleave tau in vivo at discrete locations including Asp421 and Glu391. Both cleavage products are prone to aggregation relative to wild-type, full-length tau protein. To determine the mechanism underlying this effect, the fibrillization of tau truncated after Asp421 and Glu391 residues was characterized in a full-length four-repeat tau background using quantitative electron microscopy methods under homogeneous nucleation conditions. Both C-terminal truncations decreased critical concentration relative to full-length tau, resulting in more filament mass at reaction plateau. Moreover, truncation directly augmented the efficiency of the nucleation reaction. The results suggest the mechanism through which C-terminal proteolysis can modulate tau filament accumulation depending on whether it precedes or follows nucleation.

<ABSTRACT>
RNA editing in flowering plant mitochondria alters numerous C nucleotides in a given mRNA molecule to U residues. To investigate whether neighbouring editing sites can influence each other we analyzed in vitro RNA editing of two sites spaced 30 nt apart. Deletion and competition experiments show that these two sites carry independent essential specificity determinants in the respective upstream 20-30 nucleotides. However, deletion of a an upstream sequence region promoting editing of the upstream site concomitantly decreases RNA editing of the second site 50-70 nucleotides downstream. This result suggests that supporting cis-/trans-interactions can be effective over larger distances and can affect more than one editing event.

<ABSTRACT>
Deleted in liver cancer 2 (DLC2) is a candidate tumor suppressor frequently found to be deleted in hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, we determined the subcellular localization of DLC2. Co-localization and biochemical fractionation studies revealed that DLC2 localized to mitochondria. In addition, the DLC2-containing cytoplasmic speckles were in proximity to lipid droplets. A DLC2 mutant containing the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain only showed a localization pattern identical to that of DLC2. Taken together, we have provided the first evidence for mitochondrial localization of DLC2 through the START domain. These findings might have implications in liver physiology and carcinogenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
Plants produce a large number of secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, terpenoids, polyphenols, quinones and many further compounds having combined structures of those groups. Physiological roles of those metabolites for plants are still under investigation, but they play, at least in part, important functions as protectants for plant bodies against herbivores and pathogens, as well as from physical stresses like ultraviolet light and heat. In order to accomplish these functions, biosyntheses and accumulation of secondary metabolites are highly regulated in a temporal and spatial manner in plant organs, where they can appropriately accumulate. In this mini-review, I introduce the mechanism of accumulation and membrane transport of these metabolites, in particular, focusing on ATP-binding cassette transporters involved.

<ABSTRACT>
We determined the first structure of PRYSPRY, a domain found in over 500 different proteins, involved in innate immune signaling, cytokine signaling suppression, development, cell growth and retroviral restriction. The fold encompasses a 7-stranded and a 6-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, arranged in a beta-sandwich. In the crystal, PRYSPRY forms a dimer where the C-terminus of an acceptor molecule binds to the concave surface of a donor molecule, which represents a putative interaction site. Mutations in the PRYSPRY domains of Pyrin, which are responsible for familial Mediterranean fever, map on the putative PRYSPRY interaction site.

<ABSTRACT>
The ability for long-range communication through intercellular calcium waves is inherent to cells of many tissues. A dual propagation mode for these waves includes passage of IP3 through gap junctions as well as an extracellular pathway involving ATP. The wave can be regenerative and include ATP-induced ATP release via an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that pannexin 1 channels can be activated by extracellular ATP acting through purinergic receptors of the P2Y group as well as by cytoplasmic calcium. Based on its properties, including ATP permeability, pannexin 1 may be involved in both initiation and propagation of calcium waves.

<ABSTRACT>
It is becoming increasingly evident that the absorption of certain nutrients and drugs and their effects are largely influenced by the concomitant ingestion of other substances. As various xeno- and endobiotics belong to the class of organic cations, the aim of this work was to study the modulation of the intestinal apical uptake of organic cations by diet procyanidins. Five procyanidin fractions with different structural complexity were obtained after fractionation of a grape seed extract. The effect of these compounds on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) uptake was evaluated in Caco-2 cells. Apical uptake of 3H-MPP+ by Caco-2 cells was increased by a 60 min exposure to 600 microg ml(-1) of procyanidin fractions, that increase being positively related with procyanidins structural complexity. It was verified that 3H-MPP+ uptake increased with preincubation time. It was speculated that procyanidins were oxidized during preincubation, this change could interfered with transport activity. Tested oxidizing agents showed that the redox state of the transporter could affect its activity. Additionally, trans-stimulation experiments showed that catechin and fraction I (the simpler fraction) can use the same transporter as MPP+. The results are compatible with the hypothesis of these compounds being competitive inhibitors of MPP+ transport. In conclusion, procyanidins are capable to modulate MPP+ apical uptake in Caco-2 cells, this transport being most probably modulated through oxidation-reduction phenomena. Interactions between these compounds and drugs present in the diet may affect their absorption and bioavailability. Both the concentration and complexity of the procyanidin compounds should be taken into account in medical practice.

Human and yeast Hsp110 chaperones exhibit functional differences.

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 9;580(1):168-74. Epub 2005 Dec 9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Hsp110 proteins constitute a heterogeneous family of abundant molecular chaperones, related to the Hsp70 proteins and exclusively found in the cytosol of eukaryotic organisms. Hsp110 family members are described as efficient holdases, preventing the aggregation and assisting the refolding of heat-denatured model substrates in the presence of Hsp70 chaperones and their co-chaperones. To gain more insights into the mode of action of this protein family we compared two homologues representing two subtypes of Hsp110 proteins, S. cerevisiae Sse1 and H. sapiens Apg-2, in their structural and functional properties in vitro. In contrast to previous publications both proteins exhibited intrinsic ATPase activities, which only in the case of Sse1 could be stimulated by the Hsp40 co-chaperone Sis1. Similar to Hsp70 proteins ATP binding and hydrolysis induced conformational rearrangements in both Hsp110 proteins as detected by tryptophane fluorescence. However, nucleotide induced changes in the proteolytic digestion pattern were detected only for Sse1. Sse1 and Apg-2 thus show significant differences in their biochemical properties, which may relate to differences in their functional roles in vivo.

Improved gating of a chimeric alpha7-5HT3A receptor upon mutations at the
M2-M3 extracellular loop.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 9;580(1):256-60. Epub 2005 Dec 12.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Acetylcholine-evoked currents of the receptor chimera alpha7-5HT3A V201 expressed in Xenopus oocytes are strikingly small when compared to the amount of alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites detected at the oocyte membrane. Since the chimeric receptor is made of the extracellular N-terminal region of the rat alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the C-terminal region of the mouse 5-HT3A receptor, which includes the ion channel, we hypothesized that communication between these two regions was not optimal. Here, we show that mutating to aspartate several adjacent positions in the M2-M3 extracellular linker increases current amplitudes to different extents, thus confirming the important role of this region on receptor gating.

<ABSTRACT>
We have examined whether the long third intracellular loop (i3) of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 subtype has a rigid structure. Circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of M2i3 expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli indicated that M2i3 consists mostly of random coil. In addition, the differential CD spectrum between the M2 and M2deltai3 receptors, the latter of which lacks most of i3 except N- and C-terminal ends, gave no indication of secondary structure. These results suggest that the central part of i3 of the M2 receptor has a flexible structure.

Transformation-associated gene regulation by ATF6alpha during
hepatocarcinogenesis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 9;580(1):184-90. Epub 2005 Dec 9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have previously reported that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-regulated transmembrane transcription factor 6 alpha (ATF6alpha) is implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). In order to further identify genes that are regulated by ATF6alpha, the global gene expression profiles of the ATF6alpha-transfected and untransfected HCC cell line, HLF, were analyzed. These results were then compared with the differential gene expression patterns of poorly differentiated HCC and control non-tumorous liver tissue. Our findings demonstrate that at least 18 genes are specifically upregulated by ATF6alpha, while another UPR mediator, XBP1 or ER-stress inducer, thapsigargin could partially stimulate or even repress some of them in HCC cells. Moreover, six of these identified genes contain potential ER stress-responsive elements and/or unfolded protein response elements in their 5' regulatory regions.

Crystal structure of Escherichia coli SufC, an ABC-type ATPase component

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 9;580(1):137-43. Epub 2005 Dec 6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
SufC is an ATPase component of the SUF machinery, which is involved in the biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters. To gain insight into the function of this protein, we have determined the crystal structure of Escherichia coli SufC at 2.5A resolution. Despite the similarity of the overall structure with ABC-ATPases (nucleotide-binding domains of ABC transporters), some key differences were observed. Glu171, an invariant residue involved in ATP hydrolysis, is rotated away from the nucleotide-binding pocket to form a SufC-specific salt bridge with Lys152. Due to this salt bridge, D-loop that follows Glu171 is flipped out to the molecular surface, which may sterically inhibit the formation of an active dimer. Thus, the salt bridge may play a critical role in regulating ATPase activity and preventing wasteful ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, SufC has a unique Q-loop structure on its surface, which may form a binding site for its partner proteins, SufB and/or SufD.

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 9;580(1):206-10. Epub 2005 Dec 12.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
MSN1 is a putative yeast transcriptional activator involved in chromium (Cr) accumulation. Here we show that overexpression of MSN1 enhances Cr and sulfur accumulation and Cr tolerance in transgenic tobacco. In addition, we found that expression of NtST1 (Nicotiana tabacum sulfate transporter 1) was elevated in MSN1- expressing transgenic tobacco, suggesting that chromate and sulfate are taken up via the sulfate transporter in plants. Supporting this, expression of NtST1 increased levels of Cr and S in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our findings suggest that yeast transcriptional activators can be used for developing effective metal remediators, and for improving the nutritional status of plants.

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 9;580(1):229-32. Epub 2005 Dec 12.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Vertebrate visual pigment proteins contain a conserved carboxylic acid residue in the third transmembrane helix. In rhodopsin, Glu113 serves as a counterion to the positively charged protonated Schiff base formed by 11-cis retinal attached to Lys296. Activation involves breaking of this ion pair. In UV cone pigments, the retinyl Schiff base is unprotonated, and hence such a salt bridge is not present; yet the pigment is inactive in the dark. Mutation of Glu108, which corresponds to rhodopsin's Glu113, to Gln yields a pigment that remains inactive in the dark. The apoproteins of both the wild-type and mutant, however, are constitutively active with the mutant being of significantly higher activity. Thus, one important role for preserving the negatively charged glutamate in the third helix of UV pigments is to maintain a less active opsin in a manner similar to rhodopsin. Ligand binding itself in the absence of a salt bridge is sufficient for deactivation.

<ABSTRACT>
Although protein phosphorylation is probably the most studied post-translational modification occurring in cells, the number of proteins, which are the target of this modification, is still largely unknown. Increasing the coverage of the phosphoproteome as well as the detection of variation at the phosphorylation level would be very helpful for understanding the mechanisms of cell life and the modifications of the cell state leading to pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration. In order to further investigate variations occurring at the phosphorylation level, we have initiated the creation of a reference map of phosphorylated proteins in rat cortical neurons, employing a combination of phosphatase treatment and 2-DE/differential in gel electrophoresis technology. About 131 spots were recognized as phosphorylated proteins as they showed different migration behaviour after phosphatase treatment. The analysis of 42 selected spots was carried out by LC/MS/MS technology resulting in the identification of two new phosphoproteins.

Chemical derivatization of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine containing
peptides to increase sensitivity for MALDI-based analysis and for

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):757-66.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Protein phosphorylation is one of the most important and common ways of regulating protein function in cells. However, phosphopeptides are difficult to analyse, ionising poorly under standard MALDI conditions. Several methods have been developed to deal with the low sensitivity and specificity of phosphopeptide analysis. Here, we show an approach using a simple one-step beta-elimination/Michael addition reaction for the derivatization of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. The substitution of the negatively charged phosphate group by a positively charged S-ethylpyridyl group greatly improves the ionisation of the modified peptides, especially in MALDI MS, increasing the sensitivity of the analysis. The modification allows the formation of a unique fragment ion at m/z 106 under mild collisional activation conditions, which can be used for parent (precursor) ion scanning in order to improve both the sensitivity and the selectivity of the analysis. The optimisation of the approach is described for a standard model peptide and protein and then applied to phosphorylation analysis in two biologically derived proteins purified from different experimental systems.

<ABSTRACT>
Efficient methods for profiling of the cell surface proteome are desirable to get a deeper insight in basic biological processes, to localise proteins and to uncover proteins differentially expressed in diseases. Here we present a strategy to target cell surface exposed proteins via fluorescence labelling using CyDye DIGE fluors. This method has been applied to human cell lines in vitro as well as to a complex biological system in vivo. It allows detection of fluorophore-tagged cell surface proteins and visualisation of the accessible proteome within a single 2-D gel, simplifying subsequent UV MALDI-MS analysis.

New insights into the pathological mechanisms of cerebrotendinous
xanthomatosis in the Taiwanese using genomic and proteomic tools.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):1029-37.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an autosomal recessive lipid-storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase. Genetic analysis utilizing SSCP and direct DNA sequencing identified a new mutation. One base-pair of cytosine was deleted at codon 326 on exon 2 of CYP27 in all CTX patients while their father was heterozygotic. This novel point deletion predicts a frameshift in mRNA (Pro(102) -->Leu) and results in the appearance of a premature termination codon (TGA) to substitute for Val(106) (GTG). To characterize the pathological mechanism of CTX patients, the protein profiles of serum and leukocytes extracted from these subjects were presented by means of proteomic technologies including 2-DE and MALDI-TOF analysis. According to the results, the amount of vinculin, ABP-280, talin and vimentin in leukocytes of CTX patients had changed significantly, reflecting the changes in membrane dynamics concerning cholestanol accumulation. The expression of target proteins in CTX patients and control was further verified by western blotting which indicated the same tendency as 2-DE data. This is the first paper to integrate both genomic and proteomic concepts for analyzing the possible mechanism of CTX and provides more information for related study in the future.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(2):677-96.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In contrast to mammals, adult teleost fish exhibit an enormous potential to regenerate neuronal tissue after injuries to the CNS. By combining a well-defined cerebellar lesion paradigm with differential proteome analysis at a post-lesion survival time of 3 days, we screened for protein candidates involved in repair of the fish brain. Out of nearly 900 protein spots detected on 2-D gels, spot intensity was significantly increased at least twofold in 30 spots and decreased to at least half the intensity of control tissue in 23 spots. The proteins associated with 24 of the spots were identified by PMF and MS/MS fragmentation. The cellular localization and the spatiotemporal patterns of two of these proteins, beta-actin and beta-tubulin, were further characterized through immunohistochemistry. Comparison of the observed changes in protein abundance with the previously characterized events underlying regeneration of the cerebellum suggests that the proteins identified are especially involved in cellular proliferation and survival, as well as axonal sprouting.

Redox regulation of cyclophilin A by glutathionylation.

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):817-25.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Using redox proteomics techniques to characterize the thiol status of proteins in human T lymphocytes, we identified cyclophilin A (CypA) as a specifically oxidized protein early after mitogen activation. CypA is an abundantly expressed cytosolic protein, target of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA), for which a variety of functions has been described. In this study, we could identify CypA as a protein undergoing glutathionylation in vivo. Using MALDI-MS we identified Cys52 and Cys62 as targets of glutathionylation in T lymphocytes, and, using bioinformatic tools, we defined the reasons for the susceptibility of these residues to the modification. In addition, we found by circular dichroism spectroscopy that glutathionylation has an important impact on the secondary structure of CypA. Finally, we suggest that glutathionylation of CypA may have biological implications and that CypA may play a key role in redox regulation of immunity.

<ABSTRACT>
Evidence indicates that oxidative stress is present in dialysis patients, and is associated with vitamin C deficiency. Limited data are available regarding the effects of vitamin C supplementation on oxidative stress and inflammation markers in these patients. Moreover, there are no data available on plasma polypeptide fingerprints by proteome analysis before and after vitamin C supplementation. Therefore, we analyzed plasma samples from a prospective, randomized, open-labeled trial to assess the effects of oral vitamin C supplementation (250 mg three times per week), to define the plasma polypeptide pattern in hemodialysis patients. Our results reveal that more than 30 polypeptides show significant changes in the dialysis patients in comparison to controls with normal renal function, and that several polypeptides are affected/normalized by oral vitamin C supplementation. These results underline the remarkable potential for proteomics to recognize specific peptide profiles in different pathological situations, which might not be detected by classical methods.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen which causes pneumoniae, urinary tract infections and septicemia in immunocompromised patients. Hospital outbreaks of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae, especially those in neonatal wards, are often caused by strains producing the extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (ESBLs). An immunoproteome based approach was developed to identify candidate antigens of K. pneumoniae for vaccine development. Sera from patients with acute K. pneumoniae infections (n = 55) and a control group of sera from healthy individuals (n = 15) were analyzed for reactivity by Western blot against ESBL K. pneumoniae outer membrane proteins separated by 2-DE. Twenty highly immunogenic protein spots were identified by immunoproteomic analysis. The immunogenic proteins that are most frequently recognized by positive K. pneumoniae sera were OmpA, OmpK36, FepA, OmpK17, OmpW, Colicin I receptor protein and three novel proteins. Two of the vaccine candidate genes, OmpA (Struve et al. Microbiology 2003, 149, 167-176) and FepA (Lai, Y. C. et al.. Infect Immun 2001, 69, 7140-7145), have recently been shown to be essential in colonization and infection in an in vivo mouse model. Hence, these two immunogenic proteins could serve as potential vaccine candidates.

<ABSTRACT>
The elucidation of the molecular details of antibiotic resistance will lead to improvements in extending the efficacy of current antimicrobials. In the current study, proteomic methodologies were applied to characterize functional outer membrane proteins (Omps) of E. coli K-12 responded to tetracycline and ampicillin resistance for understanding of universal pathways that form barriers for antimicrobial agents. For this purpose, E. coli K-12 expressional outer membrane proteome was characterized and identified with the use of 2-DE and MALDI-TOF/MS methods. Then, differential Omps due to tetracycline or ampcilin resistance were determined by comparison between tetracycline minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)10, ampicillin MIC10, control0 and control10, showing 9 proteins with 11 spots for tetracycline and 8 protein with 9 spots for ampicillin, showing a difference in only 1 protein (decreased LamB in tetracyclin) between the two antibiotics. Among the proteins, 3 were known as antibiotic-resistant proteins, including TolC, OmpC and YhiU, while FimD precursor, LamB, Tsx, YfiO, OmpW, NlpB were first reported here to be antibiotic-resistance-related proteins. Our findings will be helpful for further understanding of antibiotic-resistant mechanism(s). This study also shows that the combination of Omp purification methods certainly contributes the sensitivity of Omp detection.

<ABSTRACT>
We report for the first time an expressed proteome for human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in nude mice model. Most cases of human liver cancer are HCC with highly metastatic ability. Therefore, the early prediction or diagnosis and effective treatment are the key points of research. We have previously successfully established a human HCC nude mice model (LCI-D20) with high metastasis potential. To understand better the tumor biology of HCC it is worth to explore the relativity of all expressed protein profiles in the LCI-D20 HCC nude mice model. With advanced proteomics technologies, we have carried out a proteomic analysis with following stages: protein sample preparation of cancer tissue, including total cellular extraction and sequential fractionation, 2-DE and 2-D LC separation, ESI/MALDI-MS/MS identification, as well as data-dependent bioinformatics. The identified proteins were classified bioinformatically respective to their function, biological process and intracellular localization. Some important proteins found in HCC, e.g. metabolism enzymes, proteins regulating cell motility, signaling proteins, and heat shock proteins, are discussed in terms of their metastasis.

<ABSTRACT>
To better understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying spinal nerve root injury induced by lumbar disk herniation (LDH), comparative proteomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) between patients with LDH (the experiment group) and the otherwise healthy patients who had had implants removed from healed fractures in the lower limbs (the control group) was carried out using 2-DE followed by LC-IT-MS and database searching. Image analysis of silver-stained 2-DE gels revealed that 15 protein spots showed significant differential expression between the two groups of CSF samples (p < 0.05). After searching the database we found that in CSF of LDH patients, the expression of cystatin C, apolipoprotein A-IV, vitamin D-binding protein, neurofilament triplet L protein, IgG, tetranectin, and hemoglobin were elevated. However, ProSAAS, prostagladin D2 synthase, creatine kinase B, superoxide dismutase 1 and peroxiredoxin 2 were decreased. The subsequent ELISA measured the concentration of tetranectin, vitamin D-binding protein and cystatin C and confirmed the results of proteomic analysis. These identified proteins are involved in the pathophysiological process of spinal nerve root injury caused by herniated lumbar disk. The functional implications of the alterations in the levels of these proteins are discussed in this paper.

<ABSTRACT>
To study early post-mortem changes in muscle tissues from bull calves, cytosole proteins from two muscles: M. longissimus dorsi (LD) and M. semitendinosis (ST) at 0 and 24 h after slaughter were analysed by 2-DE. Principal component analysis (PCA) and rotation testing were used to analyse the protein patterns in the two muscles in order to select protein spots that were significantly different at the two time-points. Selected proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF. Five proteins, namely cofilin, lactoylglutathione lyase, substrate protein of mitochondrial ATP-dependent proteinase SP-22, HSP 27 and HSP20, were changed in both LD and ST muscles during post-mortem storage. Fifteen additional protein changes were observed in either LD or ST muscles, and some of these changes have not previously been observed to change during post-mortem storage of bovine muscles. Further studies will reveal the relevance of these biomarkers for meat quality.

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(2):505-18.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The inability of the CNS to regenerate in adult mammals propels us to reveal associated proteins involved in the injured CNS. In this paper, either thoracic laminectomy (as sham control) or thoracic spinal cord transection was performed on male adult rats. Five days after surgery, the whole spinal cord tissue was dissected and fractionated into water-soluble (dissolved in Tris buffer) and water-insoluble (dissolved in a solution containing chaotropes and surfactants) portions for 2-DE. Protein identification was performed by MS and further confirmed by Western blot. As a result, over 30 protein spots in the injured spinal cord were shown to be up-regulated no less than 1.5-fold. These identified proteins possibly play various roles during the injury and repair process and may be functionally categorized as several different groups, such as stress-responsive and metabolic changes, lipid and protein degeneration, neural survival and regeneration. In particular, over-expression of 11-zinc finger protein and glypican may be responsible for the inhibition of axonal growth and regeneration. Moreover, three unknown proteins with novel sequences were found to be up-regulated by spinal cord injury. Further characterization of these molecules may help us come closer to understanding the mechanisms that underlie the inability of the adult CNS to regenerate.

Norditropin reveals amino acid exchange at M14_V14 rhGH.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):775-84.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) is used for the treatment of several disorders. Structural integrity of rhGH is of critical importance for its clinical use and modifications thereof may act as markers in situations such as rhGH doping, as illegal rhGH-abuse in sports is of increasing interest. In the current study we investigated homogeneity of Norditropin, a recombinant human growth hormone frequently used in medicine, expressed in E. coli, strain MC1061. The most recent proteomics technologies including 2-DE, MALDI-MS followed by MALDI-MS/MS and LC-MS followed by LC-MS/MS were used for the characterisation of rhGH. MALDI-TOF-TOF and electrospray LC-MS analysis revealed one major protein with an average molecular mass of 22 126.0 Da and some additional minor components. Electrospray LC-MS/MS of the enzymatically digested Norditropin sample showed deamidation of N(12)N(149) and N(159), oxidation of M(14), M(125) and M(170) and one amino acid exchange V(14) for M(14) present in <1% of Norditropin. While deamidation and oxidation may be due to technical reasons, the single amino acid exchange may reflect infidelity of translation rather than codon usage and copy editing by E. coli.

<ABSTRACT>
This study describes the identification of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of the bacterial pathogen Pasteurella multocida and an analysis of how the expression of these proteins changes during infection of the natural host. We analysed the sarcosine-insoluble membrane fractions, which are highly enriched for OMPs, from bacteria grown under a range of conditions. Initially, the OMP-containing fractions were resolved by 2-DE and the proteins identified by MALDI-TOF MS. In addition, the OMP-containing fractions were separated by 1-D SDS-PAGE and protein identifications were made using nano LC MS/MS. Using these two methods a total of 35 proteins was identified from samples obtained from organisms grown in rich culture medium. Six of the proteins were identified only by 2-DE MALDI-TOF MS, whilst 17 proteins were identified only by 1-D LC MS/MS. We then analysed the OMPs from P. multocida which had been isolated from the bloodstream of infected chickens (a natural host) or grown in iron-depleted medium. Three proteins were found to be significantly up-regulated during growth in vivo and one of these (Pm0803) was also up-regulated during growth in iron-depleted medium. After bioinformatic analysis of the protein matches, it was predicted that over one third of the combined OMPs predicted by the bioinformatics sub-cellular localisation tools PSORTB and Proteome Analyst, had been identified during this study. This is the first comprehensive proteomic analysis of the P. multocida outer membrane and the first proteomic analysis of how a bacterial pathogen modifies its outer membrane proteome during infection.

<ABSTRACT>
For identification and targeting of tumor-associated marker proteins, the proteome of clear cell type of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and normal kidney tissues was analyzed by 2-DE. Ketohexokinase (also called fructokinase), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose to fructose 1-phosphate, was identified by MALDI-TOF MS and found to be expressed at low rates in the renal tumor tissues. We found a decreased amount of ketohexokinase mRNA in RCC compared to that observed in the normal kidney tissues by Northern blot. The activity of ketohexokinase in 20 clear cell RCC specimens and the 20 corresponding normal kidneys was investigated, and its activity was shown to be approximately 1.4-fold lower in the RCC specimens than in the normal kidney. Ketohexokinase activity in tumor stage pT3 RCC was 1.5-fold lower than in pT1 RCC. The level of ketohexokinase activity in histological grade 3 RCC was 1.8-fold lower than that in grade 1 cancer. In addition, using in situ hybridization, it was revealed that ketohexokinase in the normal kidney tissue was confined to the proximal tubular epithelial cells, while the expression of ketohexokinase in RCC tissues was extremely low. Our research results show that the expression of human ketohexokinase was diminished in clear cell RCC.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Heavy-metal pollution of aquatic ecosystems is a widespread phenomenon after industrial consumption. Whether aquatic organisms are adapted to the heavy-metal pollutants or not, such environmental stress causes changes in physiological responses. In this study, the aquatic midge, Chironomus riparius Meigen, was used to find changes of expression of proteins in relation to cadmium exposure. Dose-response relationships between cadmium concentrations and mortality of 3rd instar midge larvae were observed and the protein levels were compared using PD-Quest after 2-DE. Comparing the intensity of protein spots, 21 proteins decreased and 18 proteins increased in response to cadmium treatment. With increased proteins, three enzymes such as S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, O-methyltransferase, and aspartokinase were involved in the glutathione biosynthesis and a key enzyme regulating fatty acid biosynthesis, oleyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase was also identified. According to the functional classification of decreased levels of proteins, they were involved in energy production, protein fate, nucleotide biosynthesis, cell division, transport and binding, signal transduction, and fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism in the cell. In addition, phenol hydroxylase, thioesterase, zinc metalloprotease, and aspartate kinase were newly expressed after cadmium exposure at the concentration of the LC(10 )value. Therefore, these proteins seem to be potential biomarkers for cadmium exposure in the aquatic ecosystems.

Establishment of a 2-D human urinary proteomic map in IgA nephropathy.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):1066-76.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis worldwide. Although chronic renal failure develops in considerable numbers of IgAN patients, the exact etiology has not yet been clearly elucidated. To establish the urinary protein map of IgAN, we performed a urinary proteomic analysis. Thirteen patients with IgAN and 12 normal controls were recruited. Morning midstream spot urine samples were used with Centriprep ultrafiltration for concentration and desalting. 2-DE was performed and compared between IgAN and normal control, and urinary proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. A large number of protein spots were identified in IgAN and normal control samples, with means of 311 spots and 174 spots, respectively. Approximately 216 protein spots were detected as differentially expressed in IgAN. Among these, 82 spots were over-expressed, and 134 spots were under-expressed compared to normal controls. A total of 84 differentially expressed spots, representing 59 different proteins, were finally identified in IgAN. We have established a urinary proteomic map of IgAN and this result helps in the identification. Further study is needed to determine the potential pathogenic role of these proteins.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(2):641-53.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A method for high-resolution proteomics analyses of complex protein mixtures is presented using multidimensional HPLC coupled to MS (MDLC-MS). The method was applied to identify proteins that are differentially expressed during fruit ripening of tomato. Protein extracts from red and green tomato fruits were digested by trypsin. The resulting highly complex peptide mixtures were separated by strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX), and subsequently analyzed by RP nano-LC coupled to quadrupole-TOF MS. For detailed quantitative comparison, triplicate RP-LC-MS runs were performed for each SCX fraction. The resulting data sets were analyzed using MetAlign software for noise and data reduction, multiple alignment and statistical variance analysis. For each RP-LC-MS chromatogram, up to 7000 mass components were detected. Peak intensity data were compared by multivariate and statistical analysis. This revealed a clear separation between the green and red tomato samples, and a clear separation of the different SCX fractions. MS/MS spectra were collected using the data-dependent acquisition mode from a selected set of differentially detected peptide masses, enabling the identification of proteins that were differentially expressed during ripening of tomato fruits. Our approach is a highly sensitive method to analyze proteins in complex mixtures without the need of isotope labeling.

Identification of glycoconjugates in the urine of a patient with
congenital disorder of glycosylation by high-resolution mass spectrometry.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):983-92.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
More than 150 molecular species were detected in a single glycoconjugate fraction obtained from urine of a congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) patient by use of high-resolution FT-ICR MS. With respect to its high-mass accuracy and resolving power, FT-ICR MS represents an ideal tool for analysis of single components in complex glycoconjugate mixtures obtained from body fluids. The presence of overlapping nearly isobaric ionic species in glycoconjugate mixtures obtained from CDG patient's urine was postulated from fragmentation data of several precursor ions obtained by nanoESI Q-TOF CID. Their existence was confirmed by high-resolution/high-mass accuracy FT-ICR MS detection. High-resolution FT-ICR mass spectra can, therefore, be generally considered for glycoscreening of complex mixture samples in a single stage. From the accurate molecular ion mass determinations the composition of glycoconjugate species can be identified. Particular enhancement of identification is offered by computer-assisted calculations in combination with monosaccharide building block analysis, which can be extended by considerations of non-carbohydrate modifications, such as amino acids, phosphates and sulfates. Taking advantage of this strategy, the number of compositions assigned to mass peaks was significantly increased in a fraction obtained from urine by size exclusion and anion exchange chromatography.

Protein sites of attack of N-chlorotaurine in Escherichia coli.

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):865-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
N-Chlorotaurine sodium (NCT) is a promising microbicidal agent for topical treatment of infections. Its targets of attack in Escherichia coli have been investigated by proteomics. Incubation in 1% NCT for 10 and 30 min revealed a change of the charge and a separation of numerous proteins into a series of spots with a different pI. Charge differences could be related to oxidation of cysteine residues to their corresponding sulfonic acids. Heat shock protein 60 appeared, while ribosome-releasing factor, d-ribose periplasmic binding protein, and malonyl-CoA transacylase spots decreased. These results indicate penetration of oxidation capacity into the bacteria and destruction of essential proteins by NCT.

<ABSTRACT>
We present an overview of the architecture of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and dissect the systems in core and accessory domains. The ABC transporter core is formed by the transmembrane domains (TMDs) and the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) that constitute the actual translocator. The accessory domains include the substrate-binding proteins, that function as high affinity receptors in ABC type uptake systems, and regulatory or catalytic domains that can be fused to either the TMDs or NBDs. The regulatory domains add unique functions to the transporters allowing the systems to act as channel conductance regulators, osmosensors/regulators, and assemble into macromolecular complexes with specific properties.

FEBS Lett. 2006 Feb 13;580(4):1112-22. Epub 2005 Dec 6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In many different plant species, genes belonging to the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP, ABCC) subfamily of ABC transporters have been identified. Following the discovery of vacuolar transport systems for xenobiotic or plant-produced conjugated organic anions, plant MRPs were originally proposed to be primarily involved in the vacuolar sequestration of potentially toxic metabolites. Indeed, heterologous expression of different Arabidopsis MRPs in yeast demonstrates their activity as ATP-driven pumps for structurally diverse substrates. Recent analysis of protein-protein interactions and the characterization of knockout mutants in Arabidopsis suggests that apart from transport functions plant MRPs play additional roles including the control of plant transpiration through the stomata. Here, we review and discuss the diverse functions of plant MRP-type ABC transporters and present an organ-related and developmental analysis of the expression of Arabidopsis MRPs using the publicly available full-genome chip data.

<ABSTRACT>
A novel supercomplex of Photosystem I (PSI) with light harvesting complex I (LHCI) was isolated from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This novel supercomplex is unique as it is the first stable supercomplex of PSI together with its external antenna. The supercomplex contains 256 chlorophylls per reaction center. The supercomplex was isolated under anaerobic conditions and may represent the State II form of the photosynthetic unit. In contrast to previously reported supercomplexes isolated in State I, which contain only 4 LHC I proteins, this supercomplex contains 10-11 LHC I proteins tightly bound to the PSI core. In contrast to plants, no LHC II is tightly bound to the PSI-LHCI supercomplex in State II. Investigation of the energy transfer from the antenna system to the reaction center core shows that the LHC supercomplexes are tightly coupled to the PSI core, not only structurally but also energetically. The excitation energy transfer kinetics are completely dominated by the fast phase, with a near-complete lack of long-lived fluorescence. This tight coupling is in contrast to all reports of energy transfer in PSI-LHCI supercomplexes (in State I), which have so far been described as weakly coupled supercomplexes with low efficiency for excitation energy transfer. These results indicate that there are large and dynamic changes of the PSI-LHCI supercomplex during the acclimation from aerobic (State I) to anaerobic (State II) conditions in Chlamydomonas.

Evidence for phosphorylation of rat liver glucose-regulated protein 58,

</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 9;580(1):199-205. Epub 2005 Dec 9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Glucose-regulated protein 58 (GRP58)-like immunoreactivity in rat liver obtained in the evening or after fasting underwent an electrophoretic band-shift, which disappeared after phosphatase-treatment. Since mass spectrometric analysis raised a possibility that Ser150 of GRP58 is phosphorylated, an antibody against the phosphoserine150 GRP58 was generated. Immunoreactivity to this antibody was increased in the evening and after fasting. Since GRP58 was shown to interact with signal transducer and activator of transduction 3 (STAT3), a leptin-related protein, the effect of leptin was examined. Immunoreactivity to the anti-phosphoGRP58 antibody was markedly elevated after the leptin injection, indicating that Ser150 of GRP58 is phosphorylated after fasting and leptin-treatment.

ABC lipid transporters: extruders, flippases, or flopless activators?
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2006 Feb 13;580(4):1171-7. Epub 2005 Dec 19.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Many mammalian ABC transporters move membrane lipids to acceptor lipid assemblies in the extracellular aqueous milieu. Because the desorption from the membrane costs more energy than provided by two ATPs, the transporter probably only translocates the lipid to a partially hydrophilic site on its extracellular face. From this high-energy site, the lipid may efficiently move to the acceptor, which ideally is bound to the transporter, or, in the absence of an acceptor, fall back into the membrane. If the lipid originated from the cytosolic membrane surface, this represents lipid flop and is probably a side activity of the transporters.

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 9;580(1):351-5. Epub 2005 Dec 19.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The H2O2-catabolizing peroxidase activity of human peroxiredoxin I (hPrxI) was previously shown to be regulated by phosphorylation of Thr90. Here, we show that hPrxI forms multiple oligomers with distinct secondary structures. HPrxI is a dual function protein, since it can behave either as a peroxidase or as a molecular chaperone. The effects of phosphorylation of hPrxI on its protein structure and dual functions were determined using site-directed mutagenesis, in which the phosphorylation site was substituted with aspartate to mimic the phosphorylated status of the protein (T90D-hPrxI). Phosphorylation of the protein induces significant changes in its protein structure from low molecular weight (MW) protein species to high MW protein complexes as well as its dual functions. In contrast to the wild type (WT)- and T90A-hPrxI, the T90D-hPrxI exhibited a markedly reduced peroxidase activity, but showed about sixfold higher chaperone activity than WT-hPrxI.

<ABSTRACT>
The scaffold protein NBR1 is involved in signal transmission downstream of the serine/protein kinase from the giant muscle protein titin. Its N-terminal Phox and Bem1p (PB1) domain plays a critical role in mediating protein-protein interactions with both titin kinase and with another scaffold protein, p62. We have determined the crystal structure of the PB1 domain of NBR1 at 1.55A resolution. It reveals a type-A PB1 domain with two negatively charged residue clusters. We provide a structural perspective on the involvement of NBR1 in the titin kinase signalling pathway.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
This study demonstrates a requirement for NF-kappaB activation in cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin)-induced apoptosis in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. This conclusion was supported by the following observations: cisplatin induced IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activation prior to cell death; pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a chemical inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation, prevented apoptosis; lactacystin, an inhibitor of IkappaBalpha degradation, also prevented apoptosis; and finally, the expression of a super-repressor mutant IkappaBalpha blocked apoptosis. The expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) was promoted by cisplatin treatment and was suppressed by PDTC treatment. In addition, a neutralizing antibody against TNFalpha protected cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that NF-kappaB activation is required for cisplatin-induced apoptosis and TNFalpha may play an important role in NF-kappaB-mediated apoptosis in cisplatin-treated HNSCC cell lines.

The mechanisms of regulation of Hdm2 protein level by serum growth
factors.

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 9;580(1):300-4. Epub 2005 Dec 19.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cell cycle progression in response to serum growth factors is dependent on the expression of functional Hdm2 (Mdm2), which inhibits p53-dependent transcription of anti-proliferative genes. In a well characterised non-transformed human fibroblast model, growth factors induce the expression of Hdm2 with rapid kinetics. Here we dissect the mechanistic basis for this critical response. In contrast to previous studies in which components of the growth factor signalling pathways were overexpressed, hdm2 mRNA expression is not induced with immediate-early kinetics in these cells. Rather, the elevated Hdm2 protein levels which follow growth factor stimulation are primarily a consequence of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-dependent stabilisation of the Hdm2 protein combined with a global increase in protein synthesis.

We report the identification, gene expression and biological activity of two parathyroid hormones (PTH; PTHA and PTHB), two PTH-related peptides (PTHrP; PTHrPA and PTHrPB) and a PTH-like ligand (PTH-L) with hybrid characteristics in puffer fishes (Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon fluviatilis). Experimental data are consistent with PTH-L and PTHrPA having calciotropic activities equivalent, respectively, to tetrapod PTH and PTHrP. We hypothesise on the basis of phylogenetic and functional analysis that PTH-L could be a fish relic of an ancestral PTH/PTHrP gene.

<ABSTRACT>
The effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on pancreatic islet function of aged rats, an animal model with impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion, was investigated. The following parameters were examined: morphological analysis of endocrine pancreata by immunohistochemistry; protein levels of insulin receptor, IRS-1, IRS-2, PI 3-kinase, Akt-1, and Akt-2; and static insulin secretion in isolated pancreatic islets. Pancreatic islets from DHEA-treated rats showed an increased beta-cell mass accompanied by increased Akt-1 protein level but reduced IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2 protein levels and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The present results suggest that DHEA may be a promising drug to prevent diabetes during aging.

<ABSTRACT>
V79 Chinese Hamster lung fibroblasts were subjected to repetitive low-grade stress through multiple exposures to 30 microM H2O2 in culture for 4 weeks. Akt/protein kinase B became phosphorylated at serine473 and threonine308 during this period of repetitive stress. Concurrent exposure of the cells to LY294002 (5 microM), a phosphoinositide-3 kinase inhibitor or 4.5 microM epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), a tea polyphenol almost completely blocked Akt activation by repetitive stress. Phosphorylation of I kappa B kinase (IKK) and transcriptional activity driven by nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) were significantly enhanced by repetitive oxidative stress. These increases were largely abolished by simultaneous exposure to EGCG. The repetitively stressed cells demonstrated a significant resistance to apoptosis by subsequent acute stress in the form of ultraviolet radiation at 5 J/m2 or H2O2 (7.5 mM). The resistance to apoptosis conferred by repetitive stress was drastically reduced (>80%) by constant exposure to EGCG during the stress period while the presence of LY294002 or the NFkappaB inhibitor SN50 brought about a relatively moderate effect (about 50-65%). Our data indicate that activation of Akt and NFkappaB pro-survival pathways by repetitive low-grade stress results in a strong inhibition of the normal apoptotic response after subsequent acute stress. The tea polyphenol EGCG impedes the activation of both Akt and NFkappaB by repetitive stress and as a result preserves the normal apoptotic response during subsequent acute stress.

<ABSTRACT>
Staphylococcus aureus possesses cell-wall attached proteins that bind the human protein fibronectin (Fn). An intermodule interface between the 4F1 and 5F1 modules in the N-terminal domain of Fn is maintained on bacterial peptide binding but there is a small change in the intermodule orientation and alignment of beta-strands that are predicted to bind the peptide. The module pair is elongated, as in the unbound state. Combined with evidence that residues in both 4F1 and 5F1 are directly involved in peptide binding, this observation supports the hypothesis that, when bound to intact Fn, the bacterial protein adopts an unusual, highly extended conformation.

<ABSTRACT>
NOSTRIN, an NO synthase binding protein, belongs to the PCH family of proteins, exposing a typical domain structure. While its SH3 domain and the C-terminal coiled-coil region cc2 have been studied earlier, the function of the N-terminal half comprising a Cdc15 domain with an FCH (Fes/CIP homology) region followed by a coiled-coil stretch cc1 is unknown. Here, we show that the FCH region is necessary and sufficient for membrane association of NOSTRIN, whereas the Cdc15 domain further specifies subcellular distribution of the protein. Thus, the FCH region and the Cdc15 domain fulfill complementary functions in subcellular targeting of NOSTRIN.

<ABSTRACT>
To identify the functional contributions of cooperations among transcription factors on regulatory DNA is critical for understanding transcription activation. But so far there is a great lack of effective identifying methods. Here we describe a novel strategy, based on comprehensively perturbed experiments and a computational model, to identify the cooperations among NF-kappaB (p65), CREB, and AP-1 in transcription activation of human cytomegalovirus major IE1 promoter/enhancer (MIEP). In this strategy, functional profiles of protein-MIEP association and RNA synthesis are achieved through comprehensively perturbing the association of p65, CREB or AP-1 with MIEP and then subjected to the computational model. Consequently, the 'real' cooperations contributing to MIEP activation are found to comprise five but not seven types of potential cooperations. Thus, our research provides a facile systematic approach to identifying the DNA-organized cooperations among transcription factors and understanding transcription activation.

In vivo tracing of canonical Wnt signaling in Xenopus tadpoles by means of
an inducible transgenic reporter tool.

<ABSTRACT>
The canonical Wnt pathway is recurrently used during embryogenesis and adult life. To track the cellular output of Wnt signaling in a living organism, we designed a hormone-inducible Wnt responsive system, capable to dynamically and specifically report Wnt pathway activities through eGFP expression. In contrast to previous in vivo reporters, our system essentially avoids interference of consecutive signals by remaining dormant until addition of hormone, which makes it a valuable tool to map canonical Wnt signaling in post-embryonic stages. Transgenic Xenopus laevis embryos were analyzed revealing at tadpole stage in specific tissues and organs cell populations with high Wnt pathway activity.

<ABSTRACT>
This paper proposes a novel method that can predict protein interaction sites in heterocomplexes using residue spatial sequence profile and evolution rate approaches. The former represents the information of multiple sequence alignments while the latter corresponds to a residue's evolutionary conservation score based on a phylogenetic tree. Three predictors using a support vector machines algorithm are constructed to predict whether a surface residue is a part of a protein-protein interface. The efficiency and the effectiveness of our proposed approach is verified by its better prediction performance compared with other models. The study is based on a non-redundant data set of heterodimers consisting of 69 protein chains.

<ABSTRACT>
Colloidal Force Microscopy was employed to study the viscoelastic and adhesive properties of macrophages upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Force vs. distance measurements were performed. The adhesion of LPS-stimulated cells (separation force=37+/-3 nN) was almost twice as high as that of resting macrophages (16+/-1 nN). Upon retraction pulling of membrane tethers was observed. Tether lengths and forces at which rupture take place did not depend on stimulation. The reduced Young's modulus K, a measure of cytoskeleton elasticity, was three times lower than that of the control. The data show that LPS has profound effects on cytomechanical and adhesion properties of macrophages.

ABCA7, a molecule with unknown function.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2006 Feb 13;580(4):1178-82. Epub 2005 Dec 19.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Many ABC proteins are functional in cellular lipid transport in various different manners. ABCA7 is a full-size ABC transporter, the physiological function of which is unknown to date. This is a protein that shows the highest homology known to ABCA1, an essential molecule for producing of plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and in fact it mimics ABCA1 to mediate the production of HDL from cellular lipid when transfected in vitro. It is therefore rational to assume that ABCA7 plays a relevant role in regulating of lipid metabolism. However, the ABCA7 expression profile is distinct from that of ABCA1, with respect to tissue-specific distribution and response to some reagents, presumably because of different transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. Potential roles and functions of ABCA7 in lipid homeostasis are discussed, especially in relation to HDL metabolism, based on available publications.

Selective induction of cyclooxygenase-2 plays a role in lysophosphatidic
acid regulated Fas ligand cell surface presentation.

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 23;580(2):443-9. Epub 2005 Dec 20.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Previous studies found that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) upregulated Fas ligand (FasL) presentation on the ovarian cancer cell surface and lead to apoptosis of activated lymphocytes. In this report, we investigated the role of selective induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) in FasL cell surface presentation stimulated by LPA. Ovarian cancer cells pretreated with general aspirin derivative acetylsalicylic acid and specific Cox-2 inhibitor (NS-398) before stimulation with LPA, FasL cell surface presentation was significantly blocked, so was the apoptosis of activated lymphocytes mediated by increasing FasL on the ovarian cancer cell surface. Using the specific inhibitors PD98059, AG1478 or dominant-negative epidermal-growth-factor receptor (EGFR-DN) plasmid, we found that the activation of ERK1/2 played a role in Cox-2 induction, and the transactivation of EGFR worked as an upstream signaling pathway in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. This study first revealed the selective induction of Cox-2 by LPA led to FasL presentation on ovarian cancer cell surface and provide cancer cell immune privilege, and might provide important information of Cox-2 in cancer progression and Cox-2 inhibitors' application in cancer chemoprevention.

<ABSTRACT>
Self-compatible S-54 homozygotic plants were found in progenies of an F(1) hybrid cultivar in Chinese cabbage. Pollination tests revealed that this self-compatibility is controlled by the S locus and caused by the loss of the recognition function of the stigma. SRK, the gene for the recognition molecule in the stigma, was normally transcribed and translated in the self-compatible plants. The 1034-bp region in the receptor domain of SRK in the self-compatible plants was 100% identical to SLG in S-54, while that in self-incompatible S-54 homozygotic plants was 95.1% identical. These results suggest that the self-compatibility of the S-54 homozygotes is due to amino-acid changes caused by gene conversion from SLG to SRK.

<ABSTRACT>
Arabidopsis contains seven Kip-related protein (KRP) genes encoding CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitors (CKIs), which shares a restricted similarity with mammalian p27Kip1. Here, we analyze the characteristics of the KRPs. Although KRP1-KRP7 interact with active cyclin D2 (CYCD2)/CDKA and CYCD2/CDKB complexes to a similar extent, they inhibit kinase activity to a different extent. Our results suggest that inhibitory activity is related to the binding ability between KRP proteins and cyclin/CDK complexes, but secondary and tertiary structure may be also involved. These data provide the first evidence that KRPs inhibit kinase activity associated with plant-specific CDKB.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) transfer visual information to the brain and are known to be susceptible to selective degeneration in various neuropathies such as glaucoma. This selective vulnerability suggests that these highly specialized neurons possess a distinct gene expression profile that becomes altered by neuropathy-associated stresses, which lead to the RGC death. In this study, to identify genes expressed predominantly in adult RGCs, a global transcriptional profile of purified primary RGCs has been compared to that of the whole retina. To avoid alterations of the original gene expression profile by cell culture conditions, we isolated RNA directly from adult RGCs purified by immunopanning without prior sub-cultivation. Genes expressed predominantly in RGCs included: Nrg1, Rgn, 14-3-3 family (Ywhah, Ywhaz, Ywhab), Nrn1, Gap43, Vsnl1, Rgs4. Some of these genes may serve as novel markers for these neurons. Our analysis revealed enrichment in genes controlling the pro-survival pathways in RGCs as compared to other retinal cells.

On the contribution of stereochemistry to human ITPK1 specificity:
Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 is not a physiologic substrate.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 9;580(1):324-30. Epub 2005 Dec 19.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, a biologically active cell constituent, was recently advocated as a substrate of human Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 1-kinase (hITPK1), because stereochemical factors were believed relatively unimportant to specificity [Miller, G.J., Wilson, M.P., Majerus, P.W. and Hurley, J.H. (2005) Specificity determinants in inositol polyphosphate synthesis: crystal structure of inositol 1,3,4-triphosphate 5/6-kinase. Mol. Cell. 18, 201-212]. Contrarily, we provide three examples of hITPK1 stereospecificity. hITPK1 phosphorylates only the 1-hydroxyl of both Ins(3,5,6)P3 and the meso-compound, Ins(4,5,6)P3. Moreover, hITPK1 has >13,000-fold preference for Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 over its enantiomer, Ins(1,4,5,6)P4. The biological significance of hITPK1 being stereospecific, and not physiologically phosphorylating Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, is reinforced by our demonstrating that Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 is phosphorylated (K(m) = 0.18 microM) by inositolphosphate-multikinase.

<ABSTRACT>
The sigma factors of RNA polymerase play central roles when bacteria adapt to different environmental conditions. We studied heat-shock responses in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 using the sigma factor inactivation strains deltasigB, deltasigD and deltasigBD. The SigB factor was found to be important for short-term heat-shock responses and acquired thermotolerance. The normal high-temperature induction of the hspA gene depended on the SigB factor. The SigD sigma factor had a role in high-temperature responses as well, and the double inactivation strain deltasigBD grew more slowly at 43 degrees C than the deltasigB and deltasigD strains.

<ABSTRACT>
CRTH2 is a recently described chemoattractant receptor for the prostaglandin, PGD(2), expressed by Th2 cells, eosinophils and basophils, and believed to play a role in allergic inflammation. Here we describe the potency of several PGD(2) metabolites at the receptor to induce cell migration and activation. We report for the first time that the PGD(2) metabolite, 9alpha,11beta-PGF(2), and its stereoisomer, PGF(2alpha), are CRTH2 agonists. 9alpha,11beta-PGF(2) is a major metabolite produced in vivo following allergen challenge, whilst PGF(2alpha) is generated independently of PGD synthetase, with implications for CRTH2 signalling in the presence or absence of PGD(2) production.

<ABSTRACT>
Phytochromes are photoreceptors that occur in plants, fungi and bacteria, among others in the phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. We constructed single and double knockout mutants of the two A. tumefaciens phytochromes Agp1 and Agp2. In liquid culture, the double mutant revealed a reduced growth rate, whereas the growth rates of the single mutants did not differ significantly from that of the wild type. Using these mutants, we analyzed the spectral properties of native A. tumefaciens phytochromes. A wild-type A. tumefaciens cell contains about 10 molecules of Agp1 and about 19 molecules of Agp2. Dark conversion of native Agp1 and Agp2 proceeds from Pfr to Pr and from Pr to Pfr, respectively, as has already been reported for the recombinant proteins. The spectral properties of recombinant and native Agp2 were significantly different. Mixing experiments with extracts from the double mutant and recombinant Agp2 imply that the spectral properties of Agp2 are modulated by components of the extract.

Here we present experimental evidence that a mammalian ortholog of AtNOS1 protein functions in the cellular context of mitochondria. The expression data suggest that a candidate for mammalian mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase contributes to multiple physiological processes during embryogenesis, which may include roles in liver haematopoesis and bone development.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Multidrug transporters are involved in mediating the failure of chemotherapy in treating several serious diseases. The archetypal multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) confers resistance to a large number of chemically and functionally unrelated anti-cancer drugs by mediating efflux from cancer cells. The ability to efflux such a large number of drugs remains a biological enigma and the lack of mechanistic understanding of the translocation pathway used by P-gp prevents rational design of compounds to inhibit its function. The translocation pathway is critically dependent on ATP hydrolysis and drug interaction with P-gp is possible at one of a multitude of allosterically linked binding sites. However, aspects such as coupling stoichiometry, molecular properties of binding sites and the nature of conformational changes remain unresolved or the centre of considerable controversy. The present review attempts to utilise the available data to generate a detailed sequence of events in the translocation pathway for this dexterous protein.

Insulin regulation of glucokinase gene expression: evidence against a role

<ABSTRACT>
Liver key genes for carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis are regulated by insulin and glucose. The sterol regulatory-element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) has emerged as a mediator of insulin effects on gene transcription, particularly on glucokinase (GK). In this paper, we show that despite stimulation of GK promoter transcription by overexpression of mature SREBP-1c, insulin induced GK transcription at least 4h ahead of accumulation of mature SREBP-1c in the nucleus. Importantly, the knockdown of SREBP-1 mRNA using a RNA-interference technique reduced the level of nuclear SREBP-1 protein, diminished fatty acid synthase mRNA level, but did not affect GK and L-pyruvate kinase mRNA levels. We concluded that SREBP-1 is unlikely to be the mediator of the early insulin effect on GK gene transcription.

Hirsutenone inhibits phorbol ester-induced upregulation of COX-2 and MMP-9

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 23;580(2):385-92. Epub 2005 Dec 19.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Inappropriate upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various types of cancer. In the present study, we investigated the effects of hirsutenone, a diarylheptanoid isolated from the medicinal plant Alnus hirsuta var. sibirica, on the expression of COX-2 and MMP-9 induced by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in MCF10A human breast epithelial cells. Treatment of MCF10A cells with TPA led to the expression of COX-2 and MMP-9. Hirsutenone at 12 microM inhibited the TPA-induced COX-2 expression at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Hirsutenone also suppressed the synthesis of prostaglandin E(2), one of the major products of COX-2, and its catalytic activity. The upregulation of MMP-9 by TPA was also significantly reduced by hirsutenone. Likewise, hirsutenone attenuated the invasiveness and motility of MCF10A cells stimulated with TPA. Hirsutenone blocked the TPA-induced DNA binding of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and translocation of p65, the functionally active NF-kappaB subunit, to the nucleus. The luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that hirsutenone abrogated the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB. Treatment of MCF10A cells with N-alpha-Tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, a specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB, reduced the TPA-induced expression of COX-2 and MMP-9. In summary, hirsutenone inhibits the TPA-induced upregulation of COX-2 and MMP-9 in human breast epithelial cells, possibly by targeting NF-kappaB, which may contribute to its chemopreventive effects.

Insights into the membrane proteome of rat liver peroxisomes: microsomal
glutathione-S-transferase is shared by both subcellular compartments.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):804-16.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Peroxisomes are ubiquitous "multipurpose" organelles of eukaryotic cells. Their matrix enzymes catalyze mainly catabolic and anabolic reactions of lipid metabolism, thus contributing to the regulation of lipid homeostasis. Since most metabolites must be actively transported across the peroxisomal membrane and since individual proteins and protein complexes play functional roles in such transport processes, we analyzed the peroxisomal membrane proteome. Benzyldimethyl-n-hexadecylammoniumchloride (16-BAC)/SDS-2-D-PAGE and mass spectrometry were used to characterize the proteomes of highly purified "light" and "heavy" peroxisomes of rat liver obtained by density gradient centrifugation. In both populations, the major integral membrane proteins could be detected in high concentrations, verifying 16-BAC/SDS-2-D-PAGE as a suitable tool for the preparation of membrane proteomes destined for mass spectrometric analysis. Both reliable and reproducible detection of a distinct set of microsomal (ER) membrane proteins, including microsomal glutathione-S-transferase (mGST), in light and heavy peroxisomal fractions was also possible. Compared with the abundance of most microsomal membrane proteins, we found mGST to be specifically enriched in peroxisomal membrane fractions. Furthermore, C terminus epitope-tagged mGST versions were localized at least in part to peroxisomes in different mammalian cell lines. Taken together, these data suggest that the peroxisomal GST is not a mere ER-contaminant, but a bona fide protein comprising the membrane proteome of both intracellular compartments. In addition, we could detect several mitochondrial proteins in light peroxisome fractions. This finding may likely indicate a physical association of light peroxisomes with mitochondria, since the organelles could be partly separated by mechanical stress. Whether this association is of functional importance awaits further investigation.

Regeneration of the secondary vascular system in poplar as a novel system

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):881-95.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Wood formation is a complex process composing many biological events. To access its key developmental stages, we have established a regeneration system that can mimic the initiation and differentiation of cambium cells for Chinese white poplar. Anatomical studies showed that new cambium and xylem re-appeared in sequence within a few weeks after being debarked. This provides the opportunity to follow key stages of wood formation by sampling clonal trees at different regeneration times. We used this system in combination with a proteomic approach to analyze proteins expressed in different regeneration stages. PMFs for 244 proteins differentially displayed were obtained and queried against public databases. Putative functions of 199 of these proteins were assigned and classified. Regulatory genes for cell cycle progression, differentiation and cell fate were expressed in the formation of cambial tissue, while 27 genes involved in secondary wall formation were predominantly found in the xylem developing stage. This indicates that the change of gene expression pattern is corresponding to the progression of second vascular system regeneration when and where the key events of wood development occur. Further exploration of these interesting genes may provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of wood formation.

Kinetics of antigen binding to antibody microspots: strong limitation by
mass transport to the surface.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):794-803.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
It is well documented that diffusion has generally a strong effect on the binding kinetics in the microtiter plate immunoassays. However, a systematic quantitative experimental evaluation of the microspot kinetics is still missing in the literature. Our work aims at filling this important gap of knowledge on the example of antigen binding to antibody microspots. A mathematical model was derived within the framework of two-compartment model and applied to the quantitative analysis of the experimental data obtained for typical antibody microspot assays. A strong mass-transport dependence of the antigen-antibody microspot kinetics was identified to be one of the main restrictions of this new technology. The binding reactions are slowed down in the microspot immunoassays by several orders of magnitude as compared with the corresponding well-stirred bulk reactions. The task to relax the mass-transport limitations should thus be one of the most important issues in designing the antibody microarrays. These limitations notwithstanding, the detection range of more than five orders of magnitude and the high sensitivity in the low femtomolar range were experimentally achieved in our study, demonstrating thus an enormous potential of this highly capable technology.

Proteomics of xenografted human breast cancer indicates novel targets
related to tamoxifen resistance.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Tamoxifen is the most frequently used drug for hormone therapy of breast cancer patients, even though a high percentage of women are (or become) refractory to this treatment. The proteins involved in tamoxifen resistance of breast tumor cells as well as the mechanisms by which they interact, are still unknown. Some years ago, we established the xenograft breast tumor 3366, sensitive to tamoxifen and the 3366/TAM, resistant to tamoxifen, derived after two years of in vivo passages of the parental 3366 under tamoxifen treatment. Here, we compare the protein expression levels of both xenografts. 2-DE of proteins from total cell extracts showed very high reproducibility among tumors from each group (tamoxifen sensitive and tamoxifen resistant). The heuristic clustering analysis of these gels pooled them correctly in both groups. Twelve proteins were found up-regulated in the tamoxifen-resistant line, while nine were down-regulated. The proteins differentially expressed were identified by MS and sequence database analysis. Biological functions of these proteins are related to cell-cell adhesion and interaction, signal transduction, DNA and protein synthesis machinery, mitochondrial respiratory chain, oxidative stress processes and apoptosis. Three of the identified proteins (ALG-2 interacting protein and two GDP-dissociation inhibitors) could be directly involved in the resistance phenomenon.

<ABSTRACT>
The discus fish (Symphysodon aequifasciata) is a cichlid demonstrating advanced mode of parental care towards fry. Both male and female fish utilized epidermal mucus secreted from specialized epidermal cells to feed developing fry. We utilized proteomics to compare protein profile from parental and nonparental fish. Gel analysis revealed a total of 35 spots that were up-regulated in parental mucus. In tandem, another 18 spots were uniquely expressed in parental mucus. MS analysis of these spots identified proteins such as fructose biphosphate aldolase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, and heat shock proteins, which are essential to support energy provision, cell repair and proliferation, stress mediation, and defense mechanism in parental fish during parental-care period. Concurrently, the detection of several antioxidant-related proteins such as thioredoxin peroxidase and hemopexin suggests a need to overcome oxidative stress during hypermucosal production in parental-care behavior. A C-type lectin was also found to be uniquely expressed in parental mucus and could have important role in providing antimicrobial defense to both parental fish and fry.

<ABSTRACT>
Physiological regulation of Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is critical for cell function. Recent direct measurements of free [Ca(2+)] inside the ER ([Ca(2+)](ER)) revealed that [Ca(2+)](ER) itself is a key regulator of ER Ca(2+) handling. However, the role of this new regulatory process in generating various patterns of Ca(2+) release remains to be elucidated in detail. Here, we incorporate the recently quantified experimental correlations between [Ca(2+)](ER) and Ca(2+) movements across the ER membrane into a mathematical model ER Ca(2+) handling. The model reproduces basic experimental dynamics of [Ca(2+)](ER). Although this was not goal in model design, the model also exhibits mechanistically unclear experimental phenomena such as "quantal" Ca(2+) release, and "store charging" by increasing resting cytosolic [Ca(2+)]. While more complex explanations cannot be ruled out, on the basis of our data we propose that "quantal release" and "store charging" could be simple re-equilibration phenomena, predicted by the recently quantified biophysical dynamics of Ca(2+) movements across the ER membrane.

On the putative co-transport of drugs by multidrug resistance proteins.

FEBS Lett. 2006 Feb 13;580(4):1085-93. Epub 2005 Dec 20.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Experiments with multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) showed 10-years ago that transport of vincristine (VCR) by MRP1 could be stimulated by GSH, and transport of GSH by VCR. Since then many examples of stimulated transport have been reported for MRP1, 2, 3, 4 and 8. We discuss here three models to explain stimulated transport. We favour a model in which a large promiscuous binding site can bind more than one ligand, allowing cooperative/competitive interactions between ligands within the binding site. We conclude that there is no unambiguous proof for co-transport of two different ligands by MRPs, but that cross-stimulated transport can explain the published data.

Chromium(III) ion and thyroxine cooperate to stabilize the transthyretin
tetramer and suppress in vitro amyloid fibril formation.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Transthyretin (TTR) amyloid fibril formation, which is triggered by the dissociation of tetrameric TTR, appears to be the causative factor in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy and senile systemic amyloidosis. Binding of thyroxine (T(4)), a native ligand of TTR, stabilizes the tetramer, but the bioavailability of T(4) for TTR binding is limited due to the preferential binding of T(4) to globulin, the major T(4) carrier in plasma. Here, we show that Cr(3+) increased the T(4)-binding capacity of wild-type (WT) and amyloidogenic V30M-TTR. Moreover, we demonstrate that Cr(3+) and T(4) cooperatively suppressed in vitro fibril formation due to the stabilization of WT-TTR and V30M-TTR.

<ABSTRACT>
Fe-only or FeFe hydrogenases, as they have more recently been termed, possess a uniquely organometallic enzyme active site, termed the H-cluster, where the electronic properties of an iron-sulfur cluster are tuned with distinctly non-biological ligands, carbon monoxide and cyanide. Recently, it was discovered that radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes were involved in active hydrogenase expression. In the current work, we present a mechanistic scheme for hydrogenase H-cluster biosynthesis in which both carbon monoxide and cyanide ligands can be derived from the decomposition of a glycine radical. The ideas presented have broader implications in the context of the prebiotic origin of amino acids.

<ABSTRACT>
Lewy bodies (LBs) are the pathologic hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Recent studies revealed that LBs exhibit several morphologic and molecular similarities to aggresomes. Aggresomes are perinuclear aggregates representing intracellular deposits of misfolded proteins. Recently, valosin-containing protein (VCP) was one of the components of LBs, suggesting its involvement in LB formation. Here, we showed the localization of VCP in aggresomes induced by a proteasome inhibitor in cultured cells. Cells overexpressing mutant VCP (K524M: D2) showed reduced aggresome formation relative to those overexpressing wild-type and mutant (K251M: D1) VCPs. Our findings suggest that the D2 domain is involved in aggresome formation.

<ABSTRACT>
To understand the role of the superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase NOX1 in the vascular system, we have generated NOX1-deficient mice. NOX1-deficient mice had a moderately decreased basal blood pressure. In response to angiotensin II they showed an almost complete loss of the sustained blood pressure response, while the initial increase was conserved. NOX1-deficient mice showed a marked reduction in aortic media hypertrophy. Angiotensin II-induced smooth muscle cell proliferation was conserved, but there was a marked decrease in extracellular matrix accumulation. Our results establish a role for NOX1 in blood pressure regulation and vascular angiotensin II response.

<ABSTRACT>
This study is to reveal the characteristics of bidirectional regulation of emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methyl-anthraquinone) and quercetin on gizzard smooth muscle myosin. Our results indicate that: (a) emodin demonstrates stimulatory effects, and quercetin produces inhibitory effects on myosin phosphorylation and Mg(2+)-ATPase activities of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylated myosin in a dose-dependent manner; (b) a combination of emodin and quercetin enhances phosphorylation and Mg(2+)-ATPase activities for partially phosphorylated myosin and inhibits those activities for fully phosphorylated myosin; (c) 1-(5-Chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H2-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine inhibits myosin phosphorylation in the presence of emodin and/or quercetin. A combination of emodin and quercetin indicates its potential for modulating gastric-intestinal smooth muscle.

<ABSTRACT>
The adaptive response induced by the lipid peroxidation products, such as phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide, lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, 7-hydroxycholesterol, and cholesterol 5beta,6beta-epoxide, was investigated in this study. Although these products have been implicated in oxidative stress-related diseases, pretreatment with such compounds at sublethal concentrations significantly protected PC12 cells against subsequent oxidative stress induced by 6-hydroxydopamine. Moreover, 4-HNE and LysoPC also exhibited adaptive protection in human arterial endothelial cells. These findings suggest a general hormetic effect of such compounds in cell cultures and may lead to a reappraisal of the eventual role of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation in organisms.

<ABSTRACT>
Thioredoxins are a class of small proteins that play a key role in regulating many cellular redox processes. We report here the characterization of the first member of the thioredoxin family in metazoans that is mainly associated with neurons. The Caenorhabditis elegans gene B0228.5 encodes a thioredoxin (TRX-1) that is expressed in ASJ ciliated sensory neurons, and to some extent also in the posterior-most intestinal cells. TRX-1 is active at reducing protein disulfides in the presence of a heterologous thioredoxin reductase. A mutant worm strain carrying a null allele of the trx-1 gene displays a reproducible decrease in both mean and maximum lifespan when compared to wild-type. The identification and characterization of TRX-1 paves the way to use C. elegans as an in vivo model to study the role of thioredoxins in lifespan and nervous system physiology and pathology.

Substrate recognition and transport by multidrug resistance protein 1
(ABCC1).

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 1 belongs to the 'C' branch of the ABC transporter superfamily. MRP1 is a high-affinity transporter of the cysteinyl leukotriene C(4) and is responsible for the systemic release of this cytokine in response to an inflammatory stimulus. However, the substrate specificity of MRP1 is extremely broad and includes many organic anion conjugates of structurally unrelated endo- and xenobiotics. In addition, MRP1 transports unmodified hydrophobic compounds, such as natural product type chemotherapeutic agents and mutagens, such as aflatoxin B(1). Transport of several of these compounds has been shown to be dependent on the presence of reduced glutathione (GSH). More recently, GSH has also been shown to stimulate the transport of some conjugated compounds, including sulfates and glucuronides. Here, we summarize current knowledge of the substrate specificity and modes of transport of MRP1 and discuss how the protein may recognize its structurally diverse substrates.

<ABSTRACT>
During the eukaryotic cell cycle, chromatin undergoes several conformational changes, which are believed to play key roles in gene expression regulation during interphase, and in genome replication and division during mitosis. In this paper, we propose a scenario for chromatin structural reorganization during mitosis, which bridges all the different scales involved in chromatin architecture, from nucleosomes to chromatin loops. We build a model for chromatin, based on available data, taking into account both physical and topological constraints DNA has to deal with. Our results suggest that the mitotic chromosome condensation/decondensation process is induced by a structural change at the level of the nucleosome itself.

Induction of TSP1 gene expression by heat shock is mediated via an
increase in mRNA stability.

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 23;580(2):510-6. Epub 2005 Dec 28.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) expression has previously been shown to be regulated primarily at the level of transcription. In the present study, transcriptional control was not involved in the induction of TSP1 by heat shock. In contrast, heat shock caused significant stabilization of TSP1 mRNA. Fusion of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of TSP1 mRNA, with a reporter gene, increased the stability of the reporter transcript by heat shock. Furthermore, we identified a putative region from 968 to 1258 from the stop codon in the TSP1 3'-UTR, involved in the stability by heat shock. Thus, the induction of TSP1 by heat shock may occur through a post-transcriptional mechanism.

Dynamic force spectroscopy of the digoxigenin-antibody complex.

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 23;580(2):505-9. Epub 2005 Dec 27.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Small ligands and their receptors are widely used non-covalent couplers in various biotech applications. One prominent example, the digoxigenin-antibody complex, was often used to immobilize samples for single molecule force measurements by optical trap or AFM. Here, we employed dynamic AFM spectroscopy to demonstrate that a single digoxigenin-antibody bond is likely to fail even under moderate loading rates. This effect potentially could lower the yield of measurements or even obscure the unbinding data of the sample by the rupture events of the coupler. Immobilization by multiple antibody-antigen bonds, therefore, is highly recommended. The analysis of our data revealed a pronounced loading rate dependence of the rupture force, which we analyzed based on the well-established Bell-Evans-model with two subsequent unbinding barriers. We could show that the first barrier has a width of Deltax(1)=1.15 nm and a spontaneous rate of k(off1)=0.015 s(-1) and the second has a width of Deltax(2)=0.35 nm and a spontaneous rate of k(off2)=4.56 s(-1). In the crossover region between the two regimes, we found a marked discrepancy between the predicted bond rupture probability density and the measured rupture force histograms, which we discuss as non-Markovian contribution to the unbinding process.

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):767-74.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
As we transition from genomics to the challenges of the functional proteome, new tools to explore the expression of proteins within tissue are essential. We have developed a method of transferring proteins from a formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues section to a stack of membranes which is then probed with antibodies for detection of individual epitopes. This method converts a traditional tissue section into a multiplex platform for expression profiling. A single tissue section can be transferred to up to ten membranes, each of which is probed with different antibodies, and detected with fluorescent secondary antibodies, and quantified by a microarray scanner. Total protein can be determined on each membrane, hence each antibody has its own normalization. This method works with phospho-specific antibodies as well as antibodies that do not readily work well with paraffin embedded tissue. This novel technique enables archival paraffin embedded tissue to be molecularly profiled in a rapid and quantifiable manner, and reduces the tissue microarray to a form of protein array. This method is a new tool for exploration of the vast archive of formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue, as well as a tool for translational medicine.

<ABSTRACT>
Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is a plasticizer and a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that may have adverse effects on human reproductive health. We examined the long-term exposure effects of DEHP on female rats and observed a strong effect on estrous cyclicity that produced a continuous diestrous stage. We found that the serum estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), pituitary FSH and luteinizing hormone levels were significantly reduced in the treated rats. To examine on the endocrine disrupting effects, we performed proteome-based analyses of their pituitaries, and found two proteins with remarkably reduced their levels. They were identified as the valosin-containing peptide/p97 (VCP/p97) and UMP-CMP kinase and their average protein spot intensities on statistical analysis of the spots differences of the treated/control rats were 0.13 and 0.21, respectively. Furthermore, there were 14 other proteins that had significantly changed levels, and their average protein spot intensities were in a range of 0.26 to 0.50 in 13 proteins and 2.74 in one. The reduction of in level of 7 proteins seems to be related to the intracellular protein transporting pathway, and it appears to suggest a slow down of gonadotrophin-releasing capability. Reduction of gonadotrophin release in the pituitary seems to lead to a decrease of serum estradiol level and continuous diestrous stage in estrous cyclicity.

<ABSTRACT>
To better understand the carcinogenesis of bladder cancer in Taiwan, we utilized the proteomic approach to search for potential biomarkers of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). Analysis by 2-DE and MS/MS indicated that seven proteins are down-regulated and three proteins up-regulated in grade III samples as compared with those of grade II. Of these deregulated proteins, fatty acid binding proteins, annexin V, heat-shock protein 27, and lactate dehydrogenase have been shown to be associated with bladder cancer. Our studies also found altered expression of a group of proteins that have not been documented previously in bladder cancer, including annexin I, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, galectin-1, lysophospholipase and mitochondrial short-chain enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase 1 precursor. These results illustrate a pattern of differential protein expression between low- and high-grade tumors and it may be utilized as the molecular fingerprinting of a subset of bladder cancers. In addition, the present study provides a valuable resource in the study of pathological mechanisms in cancers of urothelial origin. The immunohistochemical staining of grade II and III TCC samples with antiserum to annexin I protein was utilized to confirm that the annexin I protein is up-regulated in grade III TCC.

<ABSTRACT>
We investigated tyrosine phosphorylation of F(0)F(1)ATPsynthase using 3-D blue native (BN)-SDS-PAGE, a refinement of the electrophoretic analysis of mitochondrial complexes. Bovine heart mitochondria were detergent-solubilized and subjected to BN-PAGE. Bands of ATPsynthase monomer (Vmon) and dimer (Vdim) were excised and submitted to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. One protein corresponding to F(1)gamma subunit was detected by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in monomer but not in dimer. This was confirmed by MS peptide mapping. LC-ESI/MS analysis after 3-D SDS-PAGE demonstrated phosphotyrosine in fragment 43-54. NetPhos scores predicted the phosphorylated residue to be Tyr52, in a solvent-accessible loop at the foot of the F(1) central stalk.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
While lung transplant is an effective therapy for advanced lung disease, chronic allograph rejection remains a primary basis for lower survival rates than those for other solid organ transplants. This study used carefully controlled Zip-Tip extraction of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) followed by MALDI-TOF MS to identify biomarkers of chronic lung transplant rejection. Many differences were observed between controls, those who did not develop chronic rejection within 100 months, and patients who had developed chronic rejection, diagnosed as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Intensity ratios of peaks within the same MALDI-TOF profile were used to quantify the result. One of the best identifiers of BOS was a lowered ratio of clara cell protein (CCP m/z = 15,835) to lysozyme (m/z = 14,700), which gave 94% specificity and 74% sensitivity for diagnosis. Furthermore, low values for CCP/Lysozyme (<0.3) were observed in 66% of samples taken at 1 to 15 months prior to the diagnosis of BOS. Many other components of the profile gave similar or better outcomes for diagnosis but tended to be less valuable for the prediction of future disease. Overall, this study demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for the detection of disease biomarkers.

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):910-20.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The plasma membrane of a cyanobacterial cell is crucial as barrier against the outer medium. It is also an energy-transducing membrane as well as essential for biogenesis of cyanobacterial photosystems and the endo-membrane system. Previously we have identified 57 different proteins in the plasma membrane of control cells from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803. In the present work, proteomic screening of salt-stress proteins in the plasma membrane resulted in identification of 109 proteins corresponding to 66 different gene products. Differential and quantitative analyses of 2-DE profiles of plasma membranes isolated from both control and salt-acclimated cells revealed that twenty proteins were enhanced/induced and five reduced during salt stress. More than half of the enhanced/induced proteins were periplasmic binding proteins of ABC-transporters or hypothetical proteins. Proteins that exhibited the highest enhancement during salt stress include FutA1 (Slr1295) and Vipp1 (Sll0617), which have been suggested to be involved in protection of photosystem II under iron deficiency and in thylakoid membrane formation, respectively. Other salt-stress proteins were regulatory proteins such as PII protein, LrtA, and a protein that belongs to CheY subfamily. The physiological significance of the identified salt-stress proteins in the plasma membrane is discussed integrating our current knowledge on cyanobacterial stress physiology.

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):896-909.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The soluble proteins in sieve tube exudate from Brassica napus plants were systematically analyzed by 1-DE and high-resolution 2-DE, partial amino acid sequence determination by MS/MS, followed by database searches. 140 proteins could be identified by their high similarity to database sequences (135 from 2-DE, 5 additional from 1-DE). Most analyzed spots led to successful protein identifications, demonstrating that Brassica napus, a close relative of Arabidopsis thaliana, is a highly suitable model plant for phloem research. None of the identified proteins was formerly known to be present in Brassica napus phloem, but several proteins have been described in phloem sap of other species. The data, which is discussed with respect to possible physiological importance of the proteins in the phloem, further confirms and substantially extends earlier findings and uncovers the presence of new protein functions in the vascular system. For example, we found several formerly unknown phloem proteins that are potentially involved in signal generation and transport, e.g., proteins mediating calcium and G-protein signaling, a set of RNA-binding proteins, and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and its twin sister that might be key components for the regulation of flowering time.

<ABSTRACT>
Proteomic analysis of the heat shock response of wild type and a mutant of the histidine kinase 34 gene (Deltahik34), which shows increased thermal tolerance, has been performed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. In vivo radioactive labelling demonstrates that major proteomic changes occur within 1 h of heat shock. 2-D DIGE and MS have been used to quantify changes in specific proteins following heat shock in the wild type and the mutant. Over 100 spots, corresponding to 65 different proteins alter following heat shock. Changes occur not only in the classical heat shock proteins but also in the protein biosynthetic machinery, amino acid biosynthetic enzymes, components of the light and dark acts of photosynthesis and energy metabolism. The Deltahik34 cells have elevated levels of heat shock proteins under both non-heat shock and heat shock conditions, in comparison to the wild type, consistent with Hik34, or a down stream component, being a negative regulator of heat shock-responsive genes.

<ABSTRACT>
Gene expression databases, acquired by proteomics and transcriptomics, describe physiological and developmental programs at the systems level. Here we analyze proteosynthetic profiles in a bacterium undergoing defined metabolic changes. Streptomyces coelicolor cultured in a defined liquid medium displays four distinct patterns of gene expression associated with growth on glutamate, diauxic transition, and growth on maltose and ammonia that terminates by starvation for nitrogen and entry into stationary phase. Principal component and fuzzy cluster analyses of the proteome database of 935 protein spot profiles revealed principal kinetic patterns. Online linkage of the proteome database (SWICZ) to a protein-function database (KEGG) revealed limited correlations between expression profiles and metabolic pathway activities. Proteins belonging to principal metabolic pathways defined characteristic kinetic profiles correlated with the physiological state of the culture. These analyses supported the concept that metabolic flux was regulated not by individual enzymes but rather by groups of enzymes whose synthesis responded to changes in nutritional conditions. Higher-level regulation is reflected by the distribution of all kinetic profiles into only nine groups. The observation that enzymes representing principal metabolic pathways displayed their own distinctive average kinetic profiles suggested that expression of a "high-flux backbone" may dominate regulation of metabolic flux.

A modified tandem affinity purification strategy identifies cofactors of
the Drosophila nuclear receptor dHNF4.

<ABSTRACT>
With the completion of numerous genome projects, new high-throughput methods are required to ascribe gene function and interactions. A method proven successful in yeast for protein interaction studies is tandem affinity purification (TAP) of native protein complexes followed by MS. Here, we show that TAP, using Protein A and CBP tags, is not generally suitable for the purification and identification of proteins from tissues. A head-to-head comparison of tags shows that two others, FLAG and His, provide protein yields from Drosophila tissues that are an order of magnitude higher than Protein A and CBP. FLAG-His purification worked sufficiently well so that two cofactors of the Drosophila nuclear receptor protein dHNF4 could be purified from whole animals. These proteins, Hsc70 and Hsp83, are important chaperones and cofactors of other nuclear receptor proteins. However, this is the first time that they have been shown to interact with a non-steroid binding nuclear receptor. We show that the two proteins increase the ability of dHNF4 to bind DNA in vitro and to function in vivo. The tags and approaches developed here will help facilitate the routine purification of proteins from complex cells, tissues and whole organisms.

Proteomic analysis of primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma reveals
downregulation of a cell adhesion protein, periplakin.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):1011-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Recent advances in two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) such as fluorescent 2-D differential gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) has made it possible to detect and quantitate the critical changes involved in disease pathogenesis. We have previously identified novel proteins with altered expression in primary colorectal cancer using agarose 2-DE that has a higher loading capacity than immobilized pH gradient gel. The aim of this study is to identify novel proteins with altered expression in primary esophageal cancer using the powerful method of agarose 2-DE and agarose 2-D DIGE. Excised tissues from 12 patients of primary esophageal cancer were obtained. Proteins with altered expression between cancer and adjacent non-cancer tissues were analyzed by agarose 2-D DIGE and identified by mass spectrometry. Thirty-three proteins out of 74 spots with altered expression in tumors were identified. Among them, a 195-kDa protein, periplakin, was significantly downregulated in esophageal cancer, which was confirmed by immunoblotting. Immunohistochemistry showed that periplakin was mainly localized at cell-cell boundaries in normal epithelium and dysplastic lesions, while it disappeared from cell boundaries, shifted to cytoplasm, in early cancers and scarcely expressed in advanced cancers. These results suggest that periplakin could be a useful marker for detection of early esophageal cancer and evaluation of tumor progression.

Proteomic profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma in Chinese cohort reveals
heat-shock proteins (Hsp27, Hsp70, GRP78) up-regulation and their
associated prognostic values.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):1049-57.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
To facilitate the identification of candidate molecular biomarkers that are linked to the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we investigated protein-expression profiles of 146 tissue specimens including 67 pairs of tumors and adjacent non-tumors resected from HCC patients as well as 12 normal livers by 2-DE. Among the 1800 spots displayed in the liver proteome, a total of 90 protein species were found to be significantly different between the three groups (P < 0.05). Three of the top candidate markers up-regulated in HCC, with high receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, were identified by MS/MS analysis and belonged to the chaperone members: heat-shock protein (Hsp)27, Hsp70 and glucose-regulated protein (GRP)78. Over-expression of these chaperone proteins in HCC tissues was confirmed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. In correlation with clinico-pathological parameters, expression of Hsp27 was linked to alpha-fetoprotein level (P = 0.007) whereas up-regulation of GRP78 was associated with tumor venous infiltration (P = 0.035). No significant association of Hsp70 with any pathologic features was observed. The present HCC proteome analysis revealed that in response to the stressful cancerous microenvironment, tumor cells strived to increase the expression of chaperone proteins for cyto-protective function and to enhance tumor growth and metastasis.

<ABSTRACT>
At the Human Disease Glycomics/Proteome Initiative workshop held on August 27 on the occasion of the fourth HUPO Congress in Munich, Germany, the working groups reported on pilot studies, performed by 21 laboratories world-wide, to analyze glycan using MS. During the steering committee on July 31 in Osaka, Japan, it was reported that these groups have developed a system using MS to assess the world-wide network on the screening of congenital disorders of glycosylation. The concept of glycobioinformatics was also explained at this meeting. The session on PTMs laid particular emphasis on the importance of functional glycomics using glycosyltransferase genes as well as on the importance of identifying the target protein(s) carrying the sugar chains.

Guidelines for the next 10 years of proteomics.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(1):4-8.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In the last ten years, the field of proteomics has expanded at a rapid rate. A range of exciting new technology has been developed and enthusiastically applied to an enormous variety of biological questions. However, the degree of stringency required in proteomic data generation and analysis appears to have been underestimated. As a result, there are likely to be numerous published findings that are of questionable quality, requiring further confirmation and/or validation. This manuscript outlines a number of key issues in proteomic research, including those associated with experimental design, differential display and biomarker discovery, protein identification and analytical incompleteness. In an effort to set a standard that reflects current thinking on the necessary and desirable characteristics of publishable manuscripts in the field, a minimal set of guidelines for proteomics research is then described. These guidelines will serve as a set of criteria which editors of PROTEOMICS will use for assessment of future submissions to the Journal.

Proteome analysis of glandular parotid and submandibular-sublingual saliva
in comparison to whole human saliva by two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1631-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The secretions of the salivary parotid and submandibular-sublingual (SMSL) glands constitute the main part of whole human saliva (WS) in which proline-rich proteins (PRPs) and mucins represent dominant groups. Although proteome analysis had been performed on WS, no identification of PRPs or mucins by 2-DE and MS was achieved in WS and no comprehensive analysis of both glandular secretions is available so far. The aim of this study was to compare the protein map of WS to parotid and SMSL secretions for the display of PRPs and mucins. WS and glandular secretions were subjected to 2-DE and spots were analyzed by MALDI-MS. New components identified in WS were cyclophilin-B and prolyl-4-hydroxylase. Also acidic and basic PRPs as well as the proline-rich glycoprotein (PRG) could now be mapped in WS. Acidic PRPs were found equally in parotid and SMSL secretions, whereas basic PRPs and PRG were found primarily in parotid secretion. Salivary mucin MUC7 was identified in SMSL secretion. Thus, the more abundant proteins of WS can be explained mainly by mixed contributions of parotid and SMSL secretions with only few components remaining that may be derived from local sources in the oral cavity.

Two-dimensional electrophoretic profiling of atopic dermatitis in primary
cultured keratinocytes from patients.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1362-70.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Recently, we reported altered protein expression in primary cultured fibroblasts from atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. As a sequential study, we conducted proteomic analysis of primary keratinocytes derived from AD patients to further identify AD-related proteins. Three pH ranges, 4-7, 6-9, and 7-11, were used to profile the altered protein expression in AD. We obtained 46 candidate spots from the 2-D gel image analysis: 18 proteins were up-regulated and 27 proteins were down-regulated. Among the several important candidate proteins, NCC27 showed the same profile of a defect in PTM in both AD-derived keratinocytes and fibroblasts. On the basis of current and previous reports, real-time PCR was performed on select candidate genes to compare RNA and protein expression levels in AD-derived keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Our results provide new clues to aid in understanding the mechanism of atopic alterations in keratinocytes and suggest new AD-associated proteins that are important in AD pathogenesis.

Proteomic analysis of cellular change involved in mitochondria-to-nucleus
communication in L6 GLUT4myc myocytes.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1210-22.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Genetic or biochemical abnormalities in mitochondria are closely associated with apoptosis, aging, cancer, and other chronic degenerative diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion dispatches retrograde signals to the nucleus to compensate by altering the expression of various genes. In this study, a proteomic approach was used to gain insight into the nuclear gene targets of mitochondrial stress signaling and the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. We have used 2-DE to characterize the nuclear gene responses resulting from mtDNA depletion in L6 GLUT4myc myocytes. Our results showed that 77 polypeptides were differentially expressed in mtDNA-depleted cells; 33 polypeptides were down-regulated and 44 polypeptides were up-regulated. Of these differentially expressed polypeptides, 40 were identified as 36 different proteins by MALDI-TOF MS. These proteins are related to various cellular responses, such as apoptosis, cellular metabolism, signaling and cytoskeleton functions. It is suggested that the insulin resistance developed in mtDNA-depleted myocytes may be associated with disorganization of cytoskeleton assembly, and that cellular mtDNA depletion might promote the ability to evade apoptosis or other death effectors.

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1261-73.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Native low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and oxidized LDL (oxLDL) possess a wide variety of biological properties, and play a central role in atherogenesis. In this study, we used a proteomic analysis of human monocyte THP-1 cells induced with oxLDL or with LDL, to identify proteins potentially involved in atherosclerotic processes. Of the 2500 proteins detected, 93 were differentially expressed as a result of priming with LDL or oxLDL. The proteins were unambiguously identified by comparing the masses of their tryptic peptides with those of all known proteins using MALDI-TOF MS and the NCBI database. The largest differences in expression were observed for vimentin (94-fold increase), meningioma-expressed antigen 6 (48-fold increase), serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (40-fold increase), and beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase (15-fold increase). In contrast, the abundance of an unnamed protein product and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase decreased 30-fold and 25-fold, respectively. The expression of some selected proteins was confirmed by Western blot and RT-PCR analyses. The proteins identified in this study are attractive candidates for further biomarker research. This description of the altered protein profiles induced by oxLDL in human monocytes will support functional studies of the macrophage-derived foam cells involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

Functional and phenotypic relevance of differentially expressed proteins
in calcineurin mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1340-50.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Calcineurin is a heterodimeric serine/threonine protein phosphatase, important for many cellular processes such as T-cell regulation, cardiac hypertrophy and kidney development. We previously reported the characterization of Caenorhabditis elegans calcineurin mutants as providing a simple but excellent genetic model system for studying in vivo functions of calcineurin. Calcineurin loss-of-function mutants, cnb-1(lf), and gain-of-function mutants, tax-6(gf), show certain opposite phenotypes as well as some similar phenotypes. In order to explain the phenotypic similarity observed in both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants, we examined the proteins that followed similar trends in both mutants relative to wild-type worms by using 2-DE. Interestingly, VHA-13, HSP-6 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase are down-regulated in both mutants. A total of 96 differentially regulated proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/MS. Among these, 42 proteins are up-regulated and 54 proteins are down-regulated in calcineurin mutants. Furthermore, knock-down of about 30% of the genes, which are down-regulated in calcineurin mutants, showed some of the phenotypes of calcineurin-null mutants. This analysis suggests the functional relevance of these proteins to calcineurin activity in C. elegans.

High-throughput analysis of GST-fusion protein expression and
activity-dependent protein interactions on GST-fusion protein arrays with

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1110-20.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We modified gold arrays with a glutathione (GSH) surface, and investigated high-throughput protein interactions with a spectral surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. We fabricated the GSH exterior on gold surfaces by successive modification with aminoethanethiol, 4-maleimidobutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and GSH. We immobilized GST-Rac1, GST-RhoA, the GST-Rho-binding domain of rhotekin and the GST-p21-binding domain of PAK1 onto the GSH surface, and observed specific antigen-antibody interactions on the GST-fusion protein arrays. We determined the expression of GST-fusion proteins in Escherichia coli on the GSH surface with the SPR biosensor. We then analyzed the interactions of tissue transglutaminase (tTGase), a Ca2+-dependent enzyme, with RhoA and Rac1 on the GST-fusion protein arrays with the SPR biosensor. We found that tTGase interacted with RhoA and Rac1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner, indicating that the interactions were dependent on tTGase activity. In addition, transamidation of Rac1 by tTGase was dependent on Ca2+ concentration. We obtained similar results with GST pull-down assays. Thus, protein arrays prepared on the GSH surface provide a useful system for the high-throughput analysis of GST-fusion protein expression and activity-dependent protein interactions with the spectral SPR biosensors.

Differentially expressed proteins in gastrointestinal stromal tumors with
KIT and PDGFRA mutations.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1151-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) have activating mutations in either KIT or PDGFRA. However, a small subset of GIST lacks either mutation. To investigate the molecular characteristics of GIST according to mutation type, protein expression profiles in 12 GIST (2 cases with PDGFRA mutations, 8 cases with KIT mutations and 2 cases lacking either mutation) were analyzed using 2-DE and MALDI-TOF-MS. Comparative analysis of the respective spot patterns using 2-DE showed that 15 proteins were differently expressed according to the mutation status. Expression levels of septin and heat shock protein (HSP) 27 were increased in GIST with KIT mutations and annexin V was overexpressed in GIST lacking either mutation. Among the 15 proteins, overexpression of 5 proteins [annexin V, high mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1), C13orf2, glutamate dehydrogenase 1 and fibrinogen beta chain] and decreased expression of RoXaN correlated with a higher tumor grade. These findings suggest that differential protein expression can be used as a diagnostic biomarker. Moreover, it may play a role in the development and progression of GIST according to activating mutation type, as these proteins have been shown to be involved in tumor metastasis, apoptosis and immune response.

Loss of transgelin in repeated bouts of ulcerative colitis-induced colon
carcinogenesis.

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1158-65.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Though ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated colon cancer develops from dysplastic lesions caused by chronic inflammation, the specific mechanistic link between chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis in colon has not been integrated into molecular understanding. We therefore established an experimental animal model for colitic cancer, and used proteomic analysis, based on 2-DE and MALDI-TOF MS, to identify proteins involved in colitic cancer. In our model, 6-week-old C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 15 cycles of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), with each cycle consisting of 0.7% DSS for 1 week followed by distilled water for 10 days. Colorectal tumors developed in 22 of 24 mice (91.6%), with a tumor multiplicity of 1.727 per tumor-bearing mouse. Comparative 2-DE analysis showed that 38 protein spots were differentially expressed in colon tumors and normal colon. We identified 27 of these proteins, including GRP94, HSC70, enolase, prohibitin, and transgelin. The reduction of transgelin expression in mouse colon tumors was confirmed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. We also found that transgelin expression was significantly reduced in human colon tumors compared with adjacent nontumorous tissues. In conclusion, these results suggest that loss of transgelin could be a candidate for biomarker of repeated colitis-associated colon cancer.

A proteomic approach for unraveling the oncogenic H-Ras protein networks
in NIH/3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1175-86.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
To elucidate the oncogenic H-Ras network, we have established various stable and inducible oncogenic H-Ras-expressing NIH/3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cell clones, which express G12V H-Ras and G12R H-Ras proteins under the influence of a strong cytomegalovirus promoter and under the tight control of expression by an antibiotic, doxycycline, respectively. Here we provide a catalogue of proteome profiles in total cell lysates derived from oncogenic H-Ras-expressing NIH/3T3 cells. In this biological context, we compared total proteome changes by the combined methods of 2-DE, quantitative image analysis and MALDI-TOF MS analysis using both a stable expression system as well as an inducible expression system. There were a large number of common targets for oncogenic H-Ras, which were identified in both cell lines and consisted of 64 proteins (36 up-regulated and 28 down-regulated). Differentially regulated expression was further confirmed for some subsets of candidates by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. Taken together, the results presented here show that comparative analysis of the proteome from the oncogenic H-Ras-expressing cells yielded interpretable data to elucidate protein networks directly and/or indirectly.

Alternative chaperone machinery may compensate for calreticulin/calnexin
deficiency in Caenorhabditis elegans.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1329-39.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proper folding and maintenance of the native structure are central to protein function and are assisted by a family of proteins called chaperones. Calreticulin and calnexin are ER resident chaperones well conserved from worm to human. Calreticulin/calnexin knock-out mice exhibit a severe phenotype, whereas in Caenorhabditis elegans, calreticulin [crt-1(jh101)]- and calnexin [cnx-1(nr2009)]-null mutant worms exhibit only a mild phenotype, suggesting the possible existence of alternative chaperone machinery that can compensate for the deficiency of calreticulin and/or calnexin. In order to rapidly identify the compensatory chaperone components involved in this process, we analyzed the proteome of crt-1(jh101) mutants and [crt-1(jh101);cnx-1(nr2009)] double mutants. When grown at 20 degrees C, we found that five proteins were up-regulated and two proteins were down-regulated in crt-1(jh101) mutants; nine proteins were up-regulated and five proteins were down-regulated in [crt-1(jh101);cnx-1(nr2009)] double mutants. In addition, elevation of the cultivation temperature to 25 degrees C, which is still permissive to growth but causes specific defects in mutants, led to the identification of several additional proteins. Interestingly, the consistent increment of heat shock protein-70 family members (hsp70) together with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) at all the examined conditions suggests the possible compensatory function imparted by hsp70 and PDI family members in the absence of calreticulin and/or calnexin.

Profiling of differential protein expression in angiogenin-induced HUVECs
using antibody-arrayed ProteoChip.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1104-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
ProteoChip has been developed as a novel protein microarray technology. So far it has been applied in new lead screening and molecular diagnostics and we expect its role to grow in the field of biology. Here, we investigated the application of ProteoChip for the study of differential protein expression profiles in angiogenin-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Antibody microarrays constructed by immobilizing 60 distinct antibodies against signal-transducing proteins on ProteoChip base plates were used to analyze the expression pattern of cell-signaling proteins in HUVECs treated with angiogenin. The antibody microarray approach showed that angiogenin induced the up- and down-regulation of several cellular regulators related with cell proliferation. Changes in the expression of signaling proteins determined by antibody microarray were validated by Western blot analysis. In this experiment, ten up-regulated proteins and six down-regulated proteins were identified and confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Taken together, these data suggest that antibody microarrays using ProteoChip technology can be a powerful tool for high-throughput analysis of proteomes in biological samples.

Identification of immunodominant excretory-secretory cysteine proteases of
adult Paragonimus westermani by proteome analysis.

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1290-300.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Paragonimus westermani causes inflammatory lung disease in humans. The parasite excretes a host of biologically active molecules, which are thought to be involved in pathophysiological and immunological events during infection. Analyses of the 2-DE protein profiles of the excretory-secretory products (ESP) of adult P. westermani revealed approximately 147 protein spots, at least 15 of which were identified as cysteine proteases (CPs), at pHs between 4.5 and 8.5, and molecular weights (MWs) between 27 and 35 kDa. An additional three CPs (designated as PwCP-3, -8 and -11) were newly recognized by TOF/TOF MS. Their molecular biological information, which shared a high level sequence homology, was elucidated. The majority of the CPs reacted strongly with sera from paragonimiasis patients. When we observed the chronological changes in the antibody responses of the respective CPs against canine sera collected serially at 1, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 14 wk after experimental infection, these molecules exhibited a multiplicity of distinct immune recognition patterns. Our results clearly showed that P. westermani adult ESP were principally composed of excretory-secretory CPs, and that these CPs may exert effects not only on host tissue degradation and nutrient uptake, but also on the immune-regulating cells via synergistic and independent interactions.

Protein microarrays on hybrid polymeric thin films prepared by
self-assembly of polyelectrolytes for multiple-protein immunoassays.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1415-26.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We report here the development and characterization of protein microarrays fabricated on nanoengineered 3-D polyelectrolyte thin films (PET) deposited on glass slide by consecutive adsorption of polyelectrolytes via self-assembly technique. Antibodies or antigens were immobilized in the PET-coated glass slides by electrostatic adsorption and entrapment of porous structure of the 3-D polymer film and thus establishing a platform for parallel analysis. Both antigen and antibody microarrays were fabricated on the PET-coated slides, and direct and indirect immunoassays on protein microarrays for multiple-analyte detection were demonstrated. Microarrays produced on these PET-coated slides have consistent spot morphology and provide performance features needed for proteomic analysis. The protein microarrays on the PET films provide LOD as low as 6 pg/mL and dynamic ranges up to three orders of magnitude, which are wider than the protein microarrays fabricated on aldehyde and poly-L-lysine functionalized slides. The PET films constructed by self-assembly technique in aqueous solution is green chemistry based, cost-effective method to generate 3-D thin film coatings on glass surface, and the coated slide is well suited for immobilizing many types of biological molecules so that a wide variety of microarray formats can be developed on this type of slide.

<ABSTRACT>
Tetraspanins are integral membrane proteins involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. In cancer, clinical and experimental studies have reported a link between tetraspanin expression levels and metastasis. Tetraspanins play a role as organizers of a molecular network of interactions, the "tetraspanin web". Here, we have performed a proteomic characterization of the tetraspanin web using a model of human colon cancer consisting of two cell lines derived from primary tumor and metastasis from the same patient. The tetraspanin complexes were isolated after immunoaffinity purification and the proteins were identified by MS using LC-ESI-MS/MS and MALDI-FTICR. The high resolution and mass accuracy of FTICR MS allowed reliable identification using mass finger printing with only two peptides. Thus, it could be used to resolve the composition of complex peptide mixtures from membrane proteins. Different types of membrane proteins were identified, including adhesion molecules (integrins, Lu/B-CAM, GA733 proteins), receptors and signaling molecules (BAI2, PKC, G proteins), proteases (ADAM10, TADG15), and membrane fusion proteins (syntaxins) as well as poorly characterized proteins (CDCP1, HEM-1, CTL1, and CTL2). Some components were differentially detected in the tetraspanin web of the two cell lines. These differences may be relevant for tumor progression and metastasis.

Identification of S-nitrosylated proteins after chronic exposure of colon
epithelial cells to deoxycholate.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1654-62.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Apoptosis resistance, a condition favoring genomic instability, is associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer. Deoxycholate (DOC) is a hydrophobic bile salt found in high concentrations in colon cancer patients, and induces apoptosis in cultured colonic cells and ex vivo in colonic biopsies. We showed previously that the chronic exposure of colon cancer cells to increasing concentrations of DOC leads to apoptosis resistance, and the suggested mechanism involves oxidative/nitrosative stress. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key signaling molecule that regulates cell function in a variety of physiologic and pathophysiologic states. In part, NO exerts its actions by S-nitrosylation of target thiols, and several proteins are regulated through this PTM, including the caspases, the main effectors of apoptosis. Here, we performed a proteomics study in the DOC-induced apoptosis-resistant colon cell line, HCT-116RC. Its profile of S-nitrosylated proteins was compared to a control cell line not exposed to DOC. Eighteen differentially S-nitrosylated proteins were identified in the HCT-116RC cell line, 14 of these are novel targets of S-nitrosylation not previously reported. These proteins include cytoskeletal and signaling proteins, metabolic enzymes, chaperones, and redox- and differentiation-related proteins. These results broaden our knowledge of potential signal transduction pathways that may lead to the development of new biomarkers and therapy targets.

Searching for aging-related proteins in human dermal microvascular
endothelial cells treated with anti-aging agents.

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1351-61.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Endothelial cells constitute an interface between blood and tissue and act as a medium for active interaction between plasma and the intracellular environment for homeostasis. Aging of endothelial cells plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of age-related vascular diseases; however, precise mechanisms for senescence have not been elucidated. Proteomics allows identification of protein structures, functions, and characteristics, and can be applied to the study of aging processes. Using cultured human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and two-dimensional proteomic mapping, we studied the effects of kinetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, all-trans-retinoic acid, and selenium on their senescence and searched for the aging-related proteins. The treatments resulted in 68 qualitative changes and 172 quantitative changes, and we were able to identify 46 spots among them. All of the agents indicated above induced changes in the expression of moesin, rho guanosine-5'-diphosphate-dissociation inhibitor, and actin, confirmed by immunoblotting and confocal laser microscopy. As these proteins were associated with cell cycle and cytoskeleton, immunoblotting of the proteins related to cell cycle was performed. Although practical significance remains to be confirmed by in vivo research, this fundamental discovery may provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of aging and age-related diseases.

Comparative proteomic analysis of Helicobacter pylori strains associated

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Helicobacter pylori is known to cause chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer, and has also been linked to iron deficiency anemia (IDA). To determine whether H. pylori clinical isolates correlate with the prevalence of H. pylori-associated IDA, we compared the proteomic profiles of H. pylori strains isolated from antral biopsy specimens of H. pylori-positive patients with or without IDA. Fifteen strains, including eight non-IDA and seven IDA strains, were cultured under iron-rich and iron-depleted conditions and then analyzed for protein expression profiles by 2-DE. The distances between two H. pylori strains were determined on the basis of similarities between their expression patterns of 189 protein spots, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. The results revealed that the IDA strains formed a cluster separate from that of six non-IDA strains, with two non-IDA strains between the clusters. H. pylori strain 26695 was located in the non-IDA cluster. Protein spots displaying similar expression patterns were clustered, and 18 spots predominantly expressed in IDA strains were identified by MALDI-TOF analysis. These data indicate that the non-IDA and IDA strains can be distinguished by their protein expression profiles, suggesting that the polymorphism of H. pylori strains may be one of the factors determining the occurrence of H. pylori-associated IDA.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1512-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The amino acid sequences of the crystal proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. konkukian strain HL-47 are unknown. We used 1-D denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis, nano-ESI-Q-TOF-MS, and protein database searching to analyze these proteins. On SDS-PAGE gels, a preparation of purified crystal proteins exhibited 110, 102, 76, 55, 37, and 30 kDa protein bands. Immunoblotting of the gel with antiserum raised to this preparation revealed that four crystal proteins, of 110, 102, 55, and 37 kDa, reacted with the specific antiserum. The 102-kDa major protein reacted strongly. The other crystal proteins showed weak immunoreactivity. The 102 and 55 kDa proteins were analyzed by ESI-MS. The internal amino acid sequence of the 102-kDa major protein has similarity to the sequences of the surface layer protein of B. thuringiensis ssp. finitimus and B. anthracis. However, the internal amino acid sequences of the 55 kDa protein did not show any homology to proteins in the databases. Proteomic analysis of these proteins leads to the conclusion that the sequence data provided the protein databases of the crystal proteins of the konkukian ssp.

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 23;580(2):539-44. Epub 2005 Dec 28.

<ABSTRACT>
Initiation factor 1 (IF1) is an essential protein in Escherichia coli involved in the initiation step of protein synthesis. The protein level of IF1 increases when E. coli cells are subjected to cold shock, however, it remains unclear as to how this increase occurs. The infA gene encoding IF1 contains two promoters, the distal P1 and the proximal P2 promoter. In this study, we found that infA mRNA was greatly increased, and that this increase resulted from transcriptional activation of P1, not P2, during cold shock although stability of transcripts from both promoters concomitantly increased.

<ABSTRACT>
Inhibition of ATPase activity of Escherichia coli ATP synthase by magnesium fluoride (MgFx) was studied. Wild-type F(1)-ATPase was inhibited potently, albeit slowly, when incubated with MgCl(2), NaF, and NaADP. The combination of all three components was required. Reactivation of ATPase activity, after removal of unbound ligands, occurred with half-time of approximately 14 h at 22 degrees C and was quasi-irreversible at 4 degrees C. Mutant F(1)-ATPases, in which catalytic site residues involved in transition state formation were modified, were found to be resistant to inhibition by MgFx. The data demonstrate that MgFx in combination with MgADP behaves as a tight-binding transition state analog in E. coli ATP synthase.

Thiorphan, tiopronin, and related analogs as substrates and inhibitors of
peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM).
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 23;580(2):521-32. Epub 2005 Dec 28.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Peptidyglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase is a copper- and zinc-dependent, bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of glycine-extended peptides or N-acylglycines to the corresponding amides and glyoxylate. This reaction is a key step in the biosynthesis of bioactive alpha-amidated peptides and, perhaps, the primary fatty acids amides also. Two clinically useful N-acylglycines are thiorphan and tiopronin, each with a thiol moiety attached to the acyl group. We report here that thiorphan and tiopronin are substrates for PAM, exhibiting relatively low K(M,app) and V(MAX,app) values. The low V(MAX,app) values result, most likely, from a decrease in active PAM.2Cu(II) as the enzyme competes ineffectively with thiorphan and tiopronin for free copper.

Cyclin D1 activation through ATF-2 in Reg-induced pancreatic beta-cell
regeneration.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 23;580(2):585-91. Epub 2005 Dec 29.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Regenerating gene product (Reg) is induced in pancreatic beta-cells and acts as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor for regeneration via a cell surface Reg receptor. However, the manner by which Reg induces beta-cell regeneration was unknown. In the present study, we found that Reg increased phospho-ATF-2, which binds to -57 to -52 of the cyclin D1 gene to activate the promoter. The Reg/ATF-2-induced cyclin D1 promoter activation was attenuated by PI(3)K inhibitors such as LY294002 and wortmannin. In Reg knockout mouse islets, the levels of phospho-ATF-2, cyclin D1, and phospho-Rb were greatly decreased. These results indicate that the Reg-Reg receptor system stimulates the PI(3)K/ATF-2/cyclin D1 signaling pathway to induce beta-cell regeneration.

<ABSTRACT>
Yeast ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins are implicated in many biological phenomena, often acting at crossroads of vital cellular processes. Their functions encompass peptide pheromone secretion, regulation of mitochondrial function, vacuolar detoxification, as well as pleiotropic drug resistance and stress adaptation. Because yeast harbors several homologues of mammalian ABC proteins with medical importance, understanding their molecular mechanisms, substrate interaction and three-dimensional structure of yeast ABC proteins might help identifying new approaches aimed at combating drug resistance or other ABC-mediated diseases. This review provides a comprehensive discussion on the functions of the ABC protein family in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

First "hybrid" ligands of vanilloid TRPV1 and cannabinoid CB2 receptors
and non-polyunsaturated fatty acid-derived CB2-selective ligands.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 23;580(2):568-74. Epub 2005 Dec 29.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
12-Phenylacetyl-ricinoleoyl-vanillamide (phenylacetylrinvanil, PhAR, IDN5890), is an ultra-potent agonist of human vanilloid TRPV1 receptors also endowed with moderate affinity for human cannabinoid CB(2) receptors. To improve its CB(2) affinity and temper its potency at TRPV1, the modification of the polar headgroup and the lipophilic 12-acylgroup of PhAR was pursued. Replacement of the vanillyl headgroup of PhAR with various aromatic or alkyl amino groups decreased activity at TRPV1 receptors, although the dopamine, cyclopropylamine, 1'-(R)- and 1'-(S)-methyl-ethanolamine, and ethanolamine derivatives retained significant potency (EC(50) 31-126 nM). Within these compounds, the 12-phenylacetylricinoleyl cyclopropylamide and ethanolamide were the strongest ligands at CB(2) receptors, with K(i) of 22 and 44 nM, and 14- and >20-fold selectivity over cannabinoid CB(1) receptors, respectively. The propyl- and allyl-derivatives also exhibited high affinity at CB(2) receptors (K(i)=40 and 22 nM, with 40 and >80-fold selectivity over CB(1) receptors, respectively), but no activity at TRPV1 receptors. The cyclopropyl- and allyl-derivatives behaved as CB(2) inverse agonists in the GTP-gamma-S binding assay. Addition of para-methoxy, -tert-butyl or -chlorine groups to the 12-phenylacetyl moiety of PhAR produced compounds that retained full potency at TRPV1 receptors, but with improved selectivity over CB(2) or CB(1) receptors. Thus, the manipulation of PhAR led to the development of the first CB(2)/TRPV1 dual ligands and of an entirely new class of inverse agonists at CB(2) receptors. Both types of compounds might find application in the treatment of inflammation, and represent new molecular probes to investigate the endocannabinoid-endovanilloid signalling system.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
With the upsurge in known membrane protein structures, common structural themes have started to emerge. One of these is the inverted repeat, a tandem of alpha-helical domains that have similar tertiary folds but opposite membrane orientations. In all previously known examples, both repeat units were encoded in a single continuous polypeptide. Recent structures of a bacterial multidrug transporter, EmrE, revealed an inverted repeat membrane protein wherein the two repeat units are assembled from two polypeptides with the same primary sequence. Here, we speculate on some of the implications of the EmrE structure with regards to our understanding of membrane protein evolution and topogenesis.

Increased oxidation and degradation of cytosolic proteins in
alcohol-exposed mouse liver and hepatoma cells.

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1250-60.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We recently developed a sensitive method using biotin-N-maleimide (biotin-NM) as a probe to positively identify oxidized mitochondrial proteins. In this study, biotin-NM was used to identify oxidized cytosolic proteins in alcohol-fed mouse livers. Alcohol treatment for 6 wk elevated the levels of CYP2E1 and nitrotyrosine, a marker of oxidative stress. Markedly increased levels of oxidized proteins were detected in alcohol-fed mouse livers compared to pair-fed controls. The biotin-NM-labeled oxidized proteins from alcohol-exposed mouse livers were subsequently purified with streptavidin-agarose and resolved on 2-DE. More than 90 silver-stained protein spots that displayed differential intensities on 2-D gels were identified by MS. Peptide sequence analysis revealed that many enzymes or proteins involved in stress response, chaperone activity, intermediary metabolism, and antioxidant defense systems such as peroxiredoxin were oxidized after alcohol treatment. Smaller fragments of many proteins were repeatedly detected only in alcohol-fed mice, indicating that many oxidized proteins after alcohol exposure were degraded. Immunoblot results showed that the level of oxidized peroxiredoxin (inactivated) was markedly increased in the alcohol-exposed mouse livers and ethanol-sensitive hepatoma cells compared to the corresponding controls. Our results may explain the underlying mechanism for cellular dysfunction and increased susceptibility to other toxic agents following alcohol-mediated oxidative stress.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Antrodia camphorata (niu-chang-chih) is a fungus native to Taiwan that is believed to be effective in preventing diseases. This study demonstrates that 0.2-2% v/v ethanol extracts of A. camphorata cultivated by solid-state fermentation (SACE) can effectively impede the proliferation of human non-small cell lung carcinoma A549 cells but not primary human fetal lung fibroblast MRC-5. The results of apoptotic analyses implicate that SACE might trigger the apoptosis in the A549 cells by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress. Two-dimensional gel maps of non-treated and treated A549 cells were compared using PDQUEST analytical software to discover five statistically significant twofold or above-twofold differentially-expressed protein spots. The five protein spots that were significantly de-regulated were chosen for subsequent identification by high performance liquid chromatography electro-spray tandem mass spectrometry. The five proteins were later identified as human galectin-1, human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A, human Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor alpha, human calcium-dependent protease small subunit and human annexin V. All five proteins were confirmed to be down-regulated by Western blotting. The analytical results of this study help to provide insight into the effect of SACE on the gene expression of the tumor cells.

The autumn workshop of the Proteomics Standards Initiative of the Human Proteomics Organisation met to further advance the development of the existing standards in the fields of molecular interactions and mass spectrometry. In addition, new areas were addressed, in particular developing standards for the description and exchange of data from gel electrophoresis experiments. The General Proteomics Standards group is now working closely with the FuGE (Functional Genomics Experiment) efforts to define a general standard in which to encode data that will enable a systems biology approach to data analysis. Common to all these efforts is the field of protein modifications, and work has been initiated to establish an ontology in this field that can be used by both workers in the field of proteomics and the wider scientific community.

<ABSTRACT>
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters represent one of the largest families of proteins, and transport a variety of substrates ranging from ions to amphipathic anticancer drugs. The functional unit of an ABC transporter is comprised of two transmembrane domains and two cytoplasmic ABC ATPase domains. The energy of the binding and hydrolysis of ATP is used to transport the substrates across membranes. An ABC domain consists of conserved regions, the Walker A and B motifs, the signature (or C) region and the D, H and Q loops. We recently described the A-loop (Aromatic residue interacting with the Adenine ring of ATP), a highly conserved aromatic residue approximately 25 amino acids upstream of the Walker A motif that is essential for ATP-binding. Here, we review the mutational analysis of this subdomain in human P-glycoprotein as well as homology modeling, structural and data mining studies that provide evidence for a functional role of the A-loop in ATP-binding in most members of the superfamily of ABC transporters.

<ABSTRACT>
Using MIN6 beta-cells and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, the chronological sequence of binding of MafA, E47/beta2 and PDX-1 to the insulin promoter in living beta-cells were investigated. All four factors were shown to bind to the mouse insulin 2 promoter in a cyclical manner with a periodicity of approximately 10-15 min. The cyclical binding of MafA, E47 and beta2 was largely unaffected by the glucose or insulin concentration in the media. However, the binding and cycling of PDX-1 was markedly abolished in low glucose (1 mM), and this was reversed in the presence of low concentrations of insulin.

Cepharanthine triggers apoptosis in a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell

</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 23;580(2):703-10. Epub 2005 Dec 22.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cepharanthine (CEP), a biscoclaurine alkaloid, has been reported to induce cell death, however, the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unclear. We herein report that CEP induced apoptosis in HuH-7 cells through nuclear fragmentation, DNA ladder formation, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation and poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase cleavage. CEP triggered the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, the activation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38, JNK1/2 and p44/42, and the downregulation of protein kinase B/Akt. Antioxidants and SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK1/2, but not inhibitors of p38 MAPK and MEK1/2, significantly prevented cell death, thus implying that reactive oxygen species and JNK1/2 play crucial roles in the CEP-induced apoptosis of HuH-7 cells.

Effect of asymmetric distribution of phospholipids in ghost membrane from

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 23;580(2):685-90. Epub 2005 Dec 28.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
This study used rat erythrocyte ghost membrane to investigate the effect of aminophospholipid distribution in biological membranes on oxidative susceptibility. Aminophospholipids, lipid peroxidation, and carbonyl compounds were quantified; plasma membrane structure was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Inside-out vesicles (IOVs) had significantly more aminophospholipids and greater lipid peroxidation than right-side-out vesicles (ROVs). Spectrin bands in IOVs disappeared obviously than in ROVs as shown in SDS-PAGE. In both systems vesicle protein size increased significantly with oxidation. Proteins aggregated much more in IOVs than ROVs at 48 h. These observations suggest that IOVs were more susceptible to ferrous ion-induced peroxidation than ROVs and that asymmetric phospholipid distribution affects biomembranes' oxidative susceptibility.

<ABSTRACT>
Scrambled isomers (X-isomers) are fully oxidized, non-native isomers of disulfide proteins. They have been shown to represent important intermediates along the pathway of oxidative folding of numerous disulfide proteins. A simple method to assess whether X-isomers present as folding intermediate is to conduct oxidative folding of fully reduced protein in the alkaline buffer alone without any supplementing thiol catalyst or redox agent. Cardiotoxin-III (CTX-III) contains 60 amino acids and four disulfide bonds. The mechanism of oxidative folding of CTX-III has been systematically characterized here by analysis of the acid trapped folding intermediates. Folding of CTX-III was shown to proceed sequentially through 1-disulfide, 2-disulfide, 3-disulfide and 4-disulfide (scrambled) isomers as folding intermediates to reach the native structure. When folding of CTX-III was performed in the buffer alone, more than 97% of the protein was trapped as 4-disulfide X-isomers, unable to convert to the native structure due to the absence of thiol catalyst. In the presence of thiol catalyst (GSH) or redox agents (GSH/GSSG), the recovery of native CTX-III was 80-85%. These results demonstrate that X-isomers play an essential and predominant role in the oxidative folding of CTX-III.

In vivo assessment of the significance of phosphorylation of the
Arabidopsis chloroplast protein import receptor, atToc33.
</TITLE>

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 23;580(2):649-55. Epub 2005 Dec 28.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
atToc33 is a transit peptide receptor of the chloroplast outer envelope membrane, and possesses GTPase activity. In vitro, its transit peptide- and GTP-binding properties are abrogated by its phosphorylation at serine 181, which was proposed to represent an important regulatory mechanism. We mutated S181 to alanine (to prevent phosphorylation), and to aspartate and glutamate (to mimic the effects of phosphoserine), and expressed all three proteins in ppi1 (atToc33 knockout) plants using the native promoter. The mutants complemented ppi1 with equal efficiency in respect of all criteria tested, including protein import efficiency and light stress tolerance. The data suggest that atToc33 phosphorylation may not play an important role in vivo.

Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 produces a novel type of acyl-homoserine

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 23;580(2):561-7. Epub 2005 Dec 28.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Acyl-homoserine lactones (acyl-HSLs) have emerged as important regulatory molecules for many gram-negative bacteria. We have found that Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, a member of the pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophs commonly present on plant surfaces, produces several acyl-HSLs depending upon the carbon source. A novel HSL was discovered with a double unsaturated carbon chain (N-(tetradecenoyl)) (C14:2) and characterized by MS and proton NMR. This long-chain acyl-HSL is synthesized by MlaI that also directs synthesis of C14:1-HSL. The Alphaproteobacterium also produces N-hexanoyl-HSL (C6-HSL) and N-octanoyl-HSL (C8-HSL) via MsaI.

Efficient delivery of siRNA into cytokine-stimulated insulinoma cells

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Fas/FasL interactions have been proposed as a potentially important mechanism mediating beta-cell death in type 1 diabetes. Recent investigations suggest RNA interference, afforded by small interfering RNAs (siRNA), can provide specific and robust gene silencing in mammalian cells. The current study attempted to investigate the effects of silencing Fas expression with siRNA on Fas-mediated apoptosis in mouse insulinoma cells following cytokine incubation. Our results indicate that siRNA is capable of rapid inhibition of cytokine-induced Fas mRNA production and cell surface Fas protein. A complete suppression of the total Fas protein was only observed after prolonged incubation with siRNA, suggesting a slow turn-over of Fas protein. Moreover, siRNA significantly inhibited Fas-mediated beta-cell apoptosis assessed by Caspase-3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling assays, the extent of which positively correlated with the level of cell surface Fas. These observations provide additional evidence supporting a role for the Fas-mediated pathway in beta-cell destruction, and suggest that siRNA targeting Fas may be of therapeutic value in preventing type 1 diabetes and improving islet cell viability in transplantation.

<ABSTRACT>
Demyelination, the proteolytic degradation of the major membrane protein in central nervous system, myelin, is involved in many neurodegenerative diseases. In the present in vitro study the proteolytic actions of calpain, human trypsin 1 and human trypsin 4 were compared on lipid bound and free human myelin basic proteins as substrates. The fragments formed were identified by using N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry. The analysis of the degradation products showed that of these three proteases human trypsin 4 cleaved myelin basic protein most specifically. It selectively cleaves the Arg79-Thr80 and Arg97-Thr98 peptide bonds in the lipid bound form of human myelin basic protein. Based on this information we synthesized peptide IVTPRTPPPSQ that corresponds to sequence region 93-103 of myelin basic protein and contains one of its two trypsin 4 cleavage sites, Arg97-Thr98. Studies on the hydrolysis of this synthetic peptide by trypsin 4 have confirmed that the Arg97-Thr98 peptide bond is highly susceptible to trypsin 4. What may lend biological interest to this finding is that the major autoantibodies found in patients with multiple sclerosis recognize sequence 85-96 of the protein. Our results suggest that human trypsin 4 may be one of the candidate proteases involved in the pathomechanism of multiple sclerosis.

Plant polyphenols mobilize endogenous copper in human peripheral

anticancer properties.

FEBS Lett. 2006 Jan 23;580(2):533-8. Epub 2005 Dec 28.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Plant polyphenols are important components of human diet and a number of them are considered to possess chemopreventive and therapeutic properties against cancer. They are recognized as naturally occurring antioxidants but also act as prooxidants catalyzing DNA degradation in the presence of transition metal ions such as copper. Using human peripheral lymphocytes and Comet assay we have previously confirmed that resveratrol-Cu(II) is indeed capable of causing DNA degradation in cells. In this paper we show that the polyphenols alone (in the absence of added copper) are also capable of causing DNA breakage in cells. Incubation of lymphocytes with neocuproine inhibited the DNA degradation confirming that Cu(I) is an intermediate in the DNA cleavage reaction. Further, we have also shown that polyphenols generate oxidative stress in lymphocytes which is inhibited by scavengers of reactive oxygen species and neocuproine. These results are in further support of our hypothesis that anticancer mechanism of plant polyphenols involves mobilization of endogenous copper, possibly chromatin bound copper, and the consequent prooxidant action.

Surprisingly, the mechanisms of ubiquitin-chain assembly are still not known.

Cell. 2006 Jan 13;124(1):47-59.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Understanding the regulation of human gene expression requires knowledge of the "second genetic code," which consists of the binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs) and the combinatorial code by which TF binding sites are assembled to form tissue-specific enhancer elements. Using a novel high-throughput method, we determined the DNA binding specificities of GLIs 1-3, Tcf4, and c-Ets1, which mediate transcriptional responses to the Hedgehog (Hh), Wnt, and Ras/MAPK signaling pathways. To identify mammalian enhancer elements regulated by these pathways on a genomic scale, we developed a computational tool, enhancer element locator (EEL). We show that EEL can be used to identify Hh and Wnt target genes and to predict activated TFs based on changes in gene expression. Predictions validated in transgenic mouse embryos revealed the presence of multiple tissue-specific enhancers in mouse c-Myc and N-Myc genes, which has implications for organ-specific growth control and tumor-type specificity of oncogenes.

Systems analyses reveal two chaperone networks with distinct functions in
eukaryotic cells.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Jan 13;124(1):75-88.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Molecular chaperones assist the folding of newly translated and stress-denatured proteins. In prokaryotes, overlapping sets of chaperones mediate both processes. In contrast, we find that eukaryotes evolved distinct chaperone networks to carry out these functions. Genomic and functional analyses indicate that in addition to stress-inducible chaperones that protect the cellular proteome from stress, eukaryotes contain a stress-repressed chaperone network that is dedicated to protein biogenesis. These stress-repressed chaperones are transcriptionally, functionally, and physically linked to the translational apparatus and associate with nascent polypeptides emerging from the ribosome. Consistent with a function in de novo protein folding, impairment of the translation-linked chaperone network renders cells sensitive to misfolding in the context of protein synthesis but not in the context of environmental stress. The emergence of a translation-linked chaperone network likely underlies the elaborate cotranslational folding process necessary for the evolution of larger multidomain proteins characteristic of eukaryotic cells.

The processivity of multiubiquitination by the APC determines the order of
substrate degradation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Jan 13;124(1):89-103.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) coordinates mitosis and G1 by sequentially promoting the degradation of key cell-cycle regulators. Following the degradation of its substrates in G1, the APC catalyzes the autoubiquitination of its E2 UbcH10. This stabilizes cyclin A and allows it to inactivate APC(Cdh1). How the APC establishes this complex temporal sequence of ubiquitinations, referred to as substrate ordering, is not understood. Here we show that substrate ordering depends on the relative processivity of substrate multiubiquitination by the APC. Processive substrates obtain ubiquitin chains in a single APC binding event. The multiubiquitination of distributive substrates requires multiple rounds of APC binding, which render it sensitive to lower APC concentrations, competition by processive substrates, and deubiquitination. Consequently, more processive substrates are preferentially multiubiquitinated in vitro and degraded earlier in vivo. The processivity of multiubiquitination is strongly influenced by the D box within the substrate, suggesting that substrate ordering is established by a mechanism intrinsic to APC and its substrates and similar to kinetic proofreading.

Structure of DDB1 in complex with a paramyxovirus V protein: viral hijack
of a propeller cluster in ubiquitin ligase.
</TITLE>

Cell. 2006 Jan 13;124(1):105-17.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The DDB1-Cul4A ubiquitin ligase complex promotes protein ubiquitination in diverse cellular functions and is reprogrammed by the V proteins of paramyxoviruses to degrade STATs and block interferon signaling. Here we report the crystal structures of DDB1 alone and in complex with the simian virus 5 V protein. The DDB1 structure reveals an intertwined three-propeller cluster, which contains two tightly coupled beta propellers with a large pocket in between and a third beta propeller flexibly attached on the side. The rigid double-propeller fold of DDB1 is targeted by the viral V protein, which inserts an entire helix into the double-propeller pocket, whereas the third propeller domain docks DDB1 to the N terminus of the Cul4A scaffold. Together, these results not only provide structural insights into how the virus hijacks the DDB1-Cul4A ubiquitin ligase but also establish a structural framework for understanding the multiple functions of DDB1 in the uniquely assembled cullin-RING E3 machinery.

Virus-induced Abl and Fyn kinase signals permit coxsackievirus entry
through epithelial tight junctions.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Jan 13;124(1):119-31.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Group B coxsackieviruses (CVBs) must cross the epithelium as they initiate infection, but the mechanism by which this occurs remains uncertain. The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a component of the tight junction and is inaccessible to virus approaching from the apical surface. Many CVBs also interact with the GPI-anchored protein decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Here, we report that virus attachment to DAF on the apical cell surface activates Abl kinase, triggering Rac-dependent actin rearrangements that permit virus movement to the tight junction. Within the junction, interaction with CAR promotes conformational changes in the virus capsid that are essential for virus entry and release of viral RNA. Interaction with DAF also activates Fyn kinase, an event that is required for the phosphorylation of caveolin and transport of virus into the cell within caveolar vesicles. CVBs thus exploit DAF-mediated signaling pathways to surmount the epithelial barrier.

mimicry functions.

Cell. 2006 Jan 13;124(1):133-45.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Many bacterial pathogens use the type III secretion system to inject "effector" proteins into host cells. Here, we report the identification of a 24 member effector protein family found in pathogens including Salmonella, Shigella, and enteropathogenic E. coli. Members of this family subvert host cell function by mimicking the signaling properties of Ras-like GTPases. The effector IpgB2 stimulates cellular responses analogous to GTP-active RhoA, whereas IpgB1 and Map function as the active forms of Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively. These effectors do not bind guanine nucleotides or have sequences corresponding the conserved GTPase domain, suggesting that they are functional but not structural mimics. However, several of these effectors harbor intracellular targeting sequences that contribute to their signaling specificities. The activities of IpgB2, IpgB1, and Map are dependent on an invariant WxxxE motif found in numerous effectors leading to the speculation that they all function by a similar molecular mechanism.

Cell. 2006 Jan 13;124(1):147-59.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Here we report an unexpected role for the secreted Frizzled-related protein (sFRP) Sizzled/Ogon as an inhibitor of the extracellular proteolytic reaction that controls BMP signaling during Xenopus gastrulation. Microinjection experiments suggest that the Frizzled domain of Sizzled regulates the activity of Xolloid-related (Xlr), a metalloproteinase that degrades Chordin, through the following molecular pathway: Szl -| Xlr -| Chd -| BMP --> P-Smad1 --> Szl. In biochemical assays, the Xlr proteinase has similar affinities for its endogenous substrate Chordin and for its competitive inhibitor Sizzled, which is resistant to enzyme digestion. Extracellular levels of Sizzled and Chordin in the gastrula embryo and enzyme reaction constants were all in the 10(-8) M range, consistent with a physiological role in the regulation of dorsal-ventral patterning. Sizzled is also a natural inhibitor of BMP1, a Tolloid metalloproteinase of medical interest. Furthermore, mouse sFRP2 inhibited Xlr, suggesting a wider role for this molecular mechanism.

Cell. 2006 Jan 13;124(1):175-89.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Adult neovascularization relies on the recruitment of circulating cells, but their angiogenic roles and recruitment mechanisms are unclear. We show that the endothelial growth factor VEGF is sufficient for organ homing of circulating mononuclear myeloid cells and is required for their perivascular positioning and retention. Recruited bone marrow-derived circulating cells (RBCCs) summoned by VEGF serve a function distinct from endothelial progenitor cells. Retention of RBCCs in close proximity to angiogenic vessels is mediated by SDF1, a chemokine induced by VEGF in activated perivascular myofibroblasts. RBCCs enhance in situ proliferation of endothelial cells via secreting proangiogenic activities distinct from locally induced activities. Precluding RBCCs strongly attenuated the proangiogenic response to VEGF and addition of purified RBCCs enhanced angiogenesis in excision wounds. Together, the data suggest a model for VEGF-programmed adult neovascularization highlighting the essential paracrine role of recruited myeloid cells and a role for SDF1 in their perivascular retention.

pathway in Drosophila.

Cell. 2006 Jan 13;124(1):191-205.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Long-lasting forms of memory require protein synthesis, but how the pattern of synthesis is related to the storage of a memory has not been determined. Here we show that neural activity directs the mRNA of the Drosophila Ca(2+), Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent Kinase II (CaMKII), to postsynaptic sites, where it is rapidly translated. These features of CaMKII synthesis are recapitulated during the induction of a long-term memory and produce patterns of local protein synthesis specific to the memory. We show that mRNA transport and synaptic protein synthesis are regulated by components of the RISC pathway, including the SDE3 helicase Armitage, which is specifically required for long-lasting memory. Armitage is localized to synapses and lost in a memory-specific pattern that is inversely related to the pattern of synaptic protein synthesis. Therefore, we propose that degradative control of the RISC pathway underlies the pattern of synaptic protein synthesis associated with a stable memory.

Cell. 2006 Jan 13;124(1):207-19.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The ability to derive a whole-genome map of transcription-factor binding sites (TFBS) is crucial for elucidating gene regulatory networks. Herein, we describe a robust approach that couples chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with the paired-end ditag (PET) sequencing strategy for unbiased and precise global localization of TFBS. We have applied this strategy to map p53 targets in the human genome. From a saturated sampling of over half a million PET sequences, we characterized 65,572 unique p53 ChIP DNA fragments and established overlapping PET clusters as a readout to define p53 binding loci with remarkable specificity. Based on this information, we refined the consensus p53 binding motif, identified at least 542 binding loci with high confidence, discovered 98 previously unidentified p53 target genes that were implicated in novel aspects of p53 functions, and showed their clinical relevance to p53-dependent tumorigenesis in primary cancer samples.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Methylglyoxal is a highly reactive dicarbonyl degradation product formed from triose phosphates during glycolysis. Methylglyoxal forms stable adducts primarily with arginine residues of intracellular proteins. The biologic role of this covalent modification in regulating cell function is not known. Here, we report that in retinal Muller cells, increased glycolytic flux causes increased methylglyoxal modification of the corepressor mSin3A. Methylglyoxal modification of mSin3A results in increased recruitment of O-GlcNAc transferase to an mSin3A-Sp3 complex, with consequent increased modification of Sp3 by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine. This modification of Sp3 causes decreased binding of the repressor complex to a glucose-responsive GC box in the angiopoietin-2 promoter, resulting in increased Ang-2 expression. A similar mechanism involving methylglyoxal-modification of other coregulator proteins may play a role in the pathobiology of a variety of conditions associated with changes in methylglyoxal concentration, including cancer and diabetic vascular disease.

<ABSTRACT>
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a myocardial disease characterized by progressive depression of myocardial contractile function and ventricular dilatation. Thirty percent of DCM patients belong to the inherited genetic form; the rest may be idiopathic, viral, autoimmune, or immune-mediated associated with a viral infection. Disturbances in humoral and cellular immunity have been described in cases of myocarditis and DCM. A number of autoantibodies against cardiac cell proteins have been identified in DCM. In this study, we have profiled the autoantibody repertoire of plasma from DCM patients against a human protein array consisting of 37,200 redundant, recombinant human proteins and performed qualitative and quantitative validation of these putative autoantigens on protein microarrays to identify novel putative DCM specific autoantigens. In addition to analyzing the whole IgG autoantibody repertoire, we have also analyzed the IgG3 antibody repertoire in the plasma samples to study the characteristics of IgG3 subclass antibodies. By combining screening of a protein expression library with protein microarray technology, we have detected 26 proteins identified by the IgG antibody repertoire and 6 proteins bound by the IgG3 subclass. Several of these autoantibodies found in plasma of DCM patients, such as the autoantibody against the Kv channel-interacting protein, are associated with heart failure.

<ABSTRACT>
Construction of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) bank containing a vast variety of antibodies against human tissue proteins is important for proteomic research. A novel strategy of subtractive immunization using fractionated native proteins was developed for high throughput generation of mAb against human plasma proteins. By this novel approach, the bottleneck of antigen preparation can be overcome by combining repeated immunization of animals with subtracted fractions of plasma or tissue proteins and identification of target antigen by immunoprecipitation/mass spectrum strategies. Plasma freshly collected from healthy adults was pooled and three fractions were prepared by size exclusion chromatography. Mice were immunized with the fractionated plasma proteins, and 205 strains of hybridomas secreting mAb were obtained after two-round subtractive immunizations and cell fusions. In the first round, 110 strains of hybridomas were established, in which 77 strains secreting mAb were identified against 10 human plasma high-abundant proteins. In the second round, plasma fraction I was absorbed with mAb against IgM, IgG, ceruloplasmin and haptoglobin. The absorbed fraction I was used as immunogen for the second round immunization and cell fusion. Ninety-five strains of hybridomas secreting mAb were obtained. Although the target antigens of mAb from 82 strains of hybridomas were identified as IgM, IgA, alpha2-macroglobulin and fibrinogen, about 85% antibodies obtained from this round were identified as new antibodies when compared with mAb obtained in the first round immunization with plasma fraction I. The results suggest that subtractive immunization with fractionated plasma proteins followed by identification of antigens with immunoprecipitation/mass spectrum may be an effective approach for rapid preparation of mAb against high-and medium-abundant plasma or tissue proteins.

Proteomics. 2006 Jan;6(2):721-30.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Plasma lipoproteins, such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), can serve as carriers for a wide range of proteins that are involved in processes such as lipid metabolism, thrombosis, inflammation and atherosclerosis. The identification of HDL-associated proteins is essential with regards to understanding these processes at the molecular level. In this study, a combination of proteomic approaches including 1-DE and 2-DE MALDI-TOF, isotope-coded affinity tag and Western blot analysis were employed to identify proteins associated with human HDL. To minimize potential losses of HDL-associated proteins during isolation, a one-step ultracentrifugation technique was applied and the quality of purified HDL was confirmed by nephelometry, high-performance gel chromatography, and Western blot analysis. MS analysis revealed the presence of 56 HDL-associated proteins including all known apolipoproteins and lipid transport proteins. Furthermore, proteins involved in hemostasis and thrombosis, the immune and complement system were found. In addition, growth factors, receptors, hormone-associated proteins and many other proteins were found to be associated with HDL. Our approach thus resulted in the identification of a large number of proteins associated with HDL. The combination of proteomic technologies proved to be a powerful and comprehensive tool for the identification of proteins on HDL.

Runx2 phosphorylation induced by fibroblast growth factor-2/protein kinase
C pathways.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1166-74.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Runx2 is a key transcription factor in osteoblast differentiation, and its activity is regulated by fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Craniosynostosis, characterized by premature suture closure, results from mutations that generate constitutively active FGF receptors (FGFRs). We previously showed that FGF/FGFR-activated protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in the expression and activity of Runx2. Activated PKCdelta physically interacts with Runx2 in FGF2-stimulated MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cells. Immunopurified Runx2 protein reacted with PKCdelta kinase, and a phosphorylated 1460-Da peptide fragment (amino acids 241-252, 1380-Da) derived from Runx2 was also detected in MS analysis. Computer analysis predicted that Ser247 in this Runx2 can be a possible phosphorylation site by PKCdelta. We also showed that Runx2 activity after FGF stimulation correlates with the presence of the Runx2 Ser247 residue. The S247A (Ser --> Ala) mutation confers decreased transcriptional activity on a Runx2-responsive promoter after FGF treatment.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Adipose tissues play a crucial endocrine role in the control of whole body glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Considering the current substantial rise in obesity and obesity-related diseases, including diabetes, it is important to understand the molecular basis of adipocyte differentiation and its control. In this study, we have analyzed the protein expression inherent to adipogenic differentiation, by 2-DE, MALDI-TOF, and RT-PCR. This study focused on proteins that were differentially expressed by the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to adipocytes. We conducted 2-DE for each set of proteins in the cytosol of adipocytes that had differentiated from hMSC, in a pH range from 3-10. Thirty-two protein spots were shown to have different expression levels. Among these, eight up-regulated proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/MS, as the following: syntaxin binding protein 3, OSBP-related protein 3, phosphodiesterase, glycophorin, immunoglobulin kappa chain variable region, peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), bA528A10.3.1 (novel protein similar to KIAA01616, isoform 1), and T cell receptor V-beta 4. Four proteins: syntaxin-3, OSBP-related protein 3, PPAR-gamma and glycophorin were associated with adipogenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
In this study we have constructed a proteome reference map of the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio vulnificus. From the reference map, we identified several virulence-related proteins, such as ToxR and ToxS, as well as numerous proteins involved in diverse cellular functions. To search for additional virulence-related proteins, we compared the whole proteomes from the wild-type and toxR mutant of V. vulnificus and found that several proteins were up- or down-regulated in the toxR mutant. We suggest that these differentially regulated proteins whose expression is coordinately controlled by a virulence regulator ToxR, some of which are already implicated in virulence, play roles in the pathogenesis of V. vulnificus.

Characterization of plasma gelsolin as a substrate for matrix
metalloproteinases.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1192-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We previously showed that plasma gelsolin, a major component of the extracellular actin scavenging system, is an matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-14 substrate. Here we confirmed that plasma gelsolin is cleaved by MMP-14 at the plasma level, and found that it was most efficiently digested by MMP-3 followed by MMP-2, MMP-1, MMP-14, and MMP-9, in that order. Plasma gelsolin (90 kDa) was cut into several fragments of 43-48 kDa by MMP-3. The MMP-3 cleavage sites in plasma gelsolin were determined by labeling the C termini generated by in-gel digestion with 50% H2 18O combined with peptide mass mapping, and sequencing of the N-terminal amino acids. Plasma gelsolin was cleaved at Asn416-Val417, Ser51-Met52, and Ala435-Gln436. Proteolytic cleavage by MMP-3 resulted in considerable loss of its actin filament-depolymerizing activity. This suggests that MMPs weaken the extracellular actin-scavenging system by cleaving plasma gelsolin and may, therefore, be involved in pathological conditions induced by extracellular actin, such as endothelial injury, respiratory distress syndrome, hepatic necrosis, and septic shock.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1483-94.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
To provide an insight into the heterotrophic metabolism of cyanobacteria, a proteomic approach has been employed with the model organism Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The soluble proteins from Synechocystis grown under photoautotrophic and light-activated heterotrophic conditions were separated by 2-DE and identified by MALDI-MS or LC-MS/MS analysis. 2-DE gels made using narrow- and micro-range IPG strips allowed quantitative comparison of more than 900 spots. Out of 67 abundant protein spots identified, 13 spots were increased and 9 decreased under heterotrophy, representing all the major fold changes. Proteomic alterations and activity levels of selected enzymes indicate a shift in the central carbon metabolism in response to trophic change. The significant reduction in light-saturated rate of photosynthesis as well as in the expression levels of rubisco and CO(2)-concentrating mechanism proteins under heterotrophy indicates the down-regulation of the photosynthetic machinery. Alterations in the expression level of proteins involved in carbon utilization pathways refer to enhanced glycolysis, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway as well as tricarboxylic acid cycle under heterotrophy. Proteomic evidences also suggest an enhanced biosynthesis of amino acids such as histidine and serine during heterotrophic growth.

Identification of an anti-aldolase autoantibody as a diagnostic marker for
diabetic retinopathy by immunoproteomic analysis.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1200-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Circulating autoantibodies specific for retinal proteins are associated with retinal destruction in patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR). In this study, we screened diabetic sera for the presence of anti-retinal autoantibodies with an aim of developing diagnostic markers for DR. Immunoblot analysis of DR patients' sera with human retinal cytosolic proteins revealed a higher incidence of anti-retinal autoantibodies, compared to normal blood donors or diabetic patients without DR. Anti-retinal protein autoantibody profiles of DR patient sera were obtained by 2-DE immunoblot analysis. Specifically, 20 protein spots reactive with DR patient sera were identified by ESI-MS/MS. Of these spots, 14 were specific for DR patients, and 4 reacted with both non-proliferative DR (non-PDR) and PDR sera. The anti-aldolase autoantibody was selected as a DR marker candidate, and specific reactivity of DR patient sera was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with rabbit aldolase. The serum anti-aldolase autoantibody level was measured by ELISA. DR patients showed significantly higher autoantibody levels than normal donors or diabetic patients without retinopathy. However, no significant differences were observed between non-PDR and PDR patients, suggesting that the level of anti-aldolase autoantibody is not determined by the severity of retinopathy in diabetic patients. Our data collectively demonstrate that the anti-aldolase autoantibody serves as a useful marker for DR diagnosis.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1588-98.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Using high-resolution 2-DE, we resolved proteins extracted from fibrous and tuberous root tissues of 3-month-old cassava plants. Gel image analysis revealed an average of 1467 electrophoretically resolved spots on the fibrous gels and 1595 spots on the tuberous gels in pH 3-10 range. Protein spots from both sets of gels were digested with trypsin. The digests were subjected to nanoelectrospray quadrupole TOF tandem mass analysis. Currently, we have obtained 299 protein identifications for 292 gel spots corresponding to 237 proteins. The proteins span various functional categories from energy, primary and secondary metabolism, disease and defense, destination and storage, transport, signal transduction, protein synthesis, cell structure, and transcription to cell growth and division. Gel image analysis has shown unique, as well as up- and down-regulated proteins, present in the tuberous and the fibrous tissues. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the cassava root proteome is an important step towards further characterization of differentially expressed proteins and the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the development and biological functions of the two types of roots.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1640-53.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
CyDye DIGE Fluor saturation dye (saturation dye, GE Healthcare Amersham Biosciences) enables highly sensitive 2-D PAGE. As the dye reacts with all reduced cysteine thiols, 2-D PAGE can be performed with a lower amount of protein, compared with CyDye DIGE Fluor minimal dye (GE Healthcare Amersham Biosciences), the sensitivity of which is equivalent to that of silver staining. We constructed a 2-D map of the saturation dye-labeled proteins of a liver cancer cell line (HepG2) and identified by MS 92 proteins corresponding to 123 protein spots. Functional classification revealed that the identified proteins had chaperone, protein binding, nucleotide binding, metal ion binding, isomerase activity, and motor activity. The functional distribution and the cysteine contents of the proteins were similar to those in the most comprehensive 2-D database of hepatoma cells (Seow et al.., Electrophoresis 2000, 21, 1787-1813), where silver staining was used for protein visualization. Hierarchical clustering on the basis of the quantitative expression profiles of the 123 characterized spots labeled with two charge- and mass-matched saturation dyes (Cy3 and Cy5) discriminated between nine hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and primary cultured hepatocytes from five individuals, suggesting the utility of saturation dye and our database for proteomic studies of liver cancer.

Use of a fluorescent internal protein standard to achieve quantitative
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1385-98.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
2-DE is a powerful separation method for complex protein mixtures. However, large intergel variations in spot intensity limit its use for quantitative proteomics studies. To address this issue, we developed a fluorescent internal protein standard for use in 2-DE analysis. Protein samples are spiked with an Alexa-labeled internal standard (ALIS) prior to separation with 2-DE. Due to the high extinction coefficient of the Alexa-fluor, incorporation of 0.1% of total protein is sufficient to allow visualization of the internal standard yet low enough to avoid interference in subsequent quantification and identification steps. Following 2-DE, total proteins are visualized with fluorescent postelectrophoretic stains spectrally separated from ALIS. Four protein stains, Deep Purple, Sulforhodamine G, ruthenium II-tris(bathophenanthroline disulfonate) (RuTBS), and SYPRO Ruby, including improved purification and staining protocols for RuTBS and ten-fold dilutions of SYPRO Ruby were evaluated. All staining protocols were compatible with the ALIS method and had similar LODs (1-4 ng) and dynamic ranges (10(3)). ALIS is a powerful normalization method for quantitative 2-DE which avoids potential problems associated with dual spot migration patterns observed in the DIGE method. Furthermore, ALIS provides significantly improved normality in the distribution of spot abundance-variance compared to normalization through division by the total spot volume.

Alpha tocopherol supplementation elevates plasma apolipoprotein A1
isoforms in normal healthy subjects.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1695-703.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Plasma alpha-tocopherol (AT) concentrations are inversely related to cardiovascular (CV) risk; however, intervention studies with AT have failed to show any consistent benefit against CV disease (CVD). Proteomics offers the opportunity to examine novel effects of AT supplementation on protein expression and therefore improve our understanding of the physiological roles of AT. Thus, to investigate the effects of AT supplementation on the plasma proteome of healthy subjects we have undertaken a double-blind, randomised, parallel design supplementation study in which healthy subjects (n = 32; 11 male and 21 female) consumed AT supplements (134 or 268 mg/day) or placebo capsules for up to 28 days. Plasma samples were obtained before supplementation and after 14 and 28 days of supplementation for analysis of changes in the plasma proteome using 2-DE and MALDI-MS. Using semiquantitative proteomics, we observed that proapolipoprotein A1 (identified by MS and Western blotting) was altered at least two-fold. Using quantitative ELISA techniques, we confirmed a significant increase in plasma apolipoprotein A1 concentration following supplementation with AT which was both time and dose dependent (p < 0.01 after 28 days supplementation with 268 mg AT/day). These data demonstrate the time and dose sensitivity of the plasma proteome to AT supplementation.

Proteomic and SAGE profiling of murine melanoma progression indicates the

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1460-70.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Using 2-DE of total cell protein extracts, we compared soluble proteins from murine melanoma lines Tm1 and Tm5 with proteins from the nontumoral cell melan-a from which they were derived. Seventy-one of the 452 spots (average) detected with CBB were differentially accumulated, i.e., increased or decreased twofold. Forty-four spots were identified by PMF/MALDI-TOF, 15 with increased and 29 with decreased protein levels. SAGE showed that 17/34 (50%) of the differentially accumulated proteins, pI range 4-7, presented similar differences at the mRNA level. Major reductions in protein were observed in tumor cells of proteins that degrade reactive oxygen species (ROS). Decreases of > or = twofold in GST, superoxide dismutase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin 2, and peroxiredoxin 6 protein were observed. SAGE indicated the reduction of other proteins involved in ROS degradation. As expected, the accumulation of exogenous peroxides was significantly higher in the tumor cells while the levels of glutathionylation were two times lower in the tumor cells compared to melan-a. The differential accumulation of proteins involved in oncogene/tumor suppressor pathways was observed. Melanoma cells can favor survival pathways activated by ROS by inhibiting p53 pathways and activation of Ras and c-myc pathways.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1606-18.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Multivariate data analysis has been combined with proteomics to enhance the recovery of information from 2-DE of cod muscle proteins during different storage conditions. Proteins were extracted according to 11 different storage conditions and samples were resolved by 2-DE. Data generated by 2-DE was subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant partial least squares regression (DPLSR). Applying PCA to 2-DE data revealed the samples to form groups according to frozen storage time, whereas differences due to different storage temperatures or chilled storage in modified atmosphere packing did not lead to distinct changes in protein pattern. Applying DPLSR to the 2-DE data enabled the selection of protein spots critical for differentiation between 3 and 6 months frozen storage with 12 months frozen storage. Some of these protein spots have been identified by MS/MS, revealing myosin light chain 1, 2 and 3, triose-phosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase A and two alpha-actin fragments, and a nuclease diphosphate kinase B fragment to change in concentration, during frozen storage. Application of proteomics, multivariate data analysis and MS/MS to analyse protein changes in cod muscle proteins during storage has revealed new knowledge on the issue and enables a better understanding of biochemical processes occurring.

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1121-32.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In shotgun proteomics, proteins can be fractionated by 1-D gel electrophoresis and digested into peptides, followed by liquid chromatography to separate the peptide mixture. Mass spectrometry generates hundreds of thousands of tandem mass spectra from these fractions, and proteins are identified by database searching. However, the search scores are usually not sufficient to distinguish the correct peptides. In this study, we propose a confident protein identification method for high-throughput analysis of human proteome. To build a filtering protocol in database search, we chose Pseudomonas putida KT2440 as a reference because this bacterial proteome contains fewer modifications and is simpler than the human proteome. First, the P. putida KT2440 proteome was filtered by reversed sequence database search and correlated by the molecular weight in 1-D-gel band positions. The characterization protocol was then applied to determine the criteria for clustering of the human plasma proteome into three different groups. This protein filtering method, based on bacterial proteome data analysis, represents a rapid way to generate higher confidence protein list of the human proteome, which includes some of heavily modified and cleaved proteins.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Protein nanoarrays are addressable ensembles of nano-scale protein domain on solid surfaces. This method can serve as a useful platform for ultraminiaturized bioanalysis. In this study, we investigated single molecular nanopatterning and molecular interaction of proteins that were immobilized on Prolinker surface of gold-coated silicon wafer by using dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) method. Contact force and humidity were optimized at 0.01 nN and 80%, respectively. The domain features of protein nanoarrays were developed at the contact time of 5 s. The optimized conditions for the nanoarray process were applied to create protein nanoarray using integrin alpha(v)beta3 and angiogenin. Constructed protein nanoarrays using integrin alpha(v)beta3 have single molecular monolayer with regular domain shape (height 15 +/- 5 nm). The changed height value due to the single molecular interaction between integrin alpha(v)beta3 and vitronectin was approximately 30 +/- 5 nm on Prolinker surface as measured with atomic force microscopy tip. Taken together, these results suggest that protein nanoarray on Prolinker surface fabricated by well-controlled DPN process can be used to analyze single molecular interaction of protein.

Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(4):1230-6.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a fatal autosomal recessive cholesterol disorder characterized by severe progressive neurodegeneration. To unveil the mechanism of neurodegeneration, proteomic and morphological approaches were applied to the hippocampus in NPC -/- mouse. Two-DE was utilized to resolve the hippocampal protein expression profiles of 4- and 8-week-old NPC +/+ and -/- mice. Differentially expressed protein spots were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and database searching. At 4 weeks of age, there was no significant difference in protein profiles between NPC +/+ and -/- mice. However, at the age of 8 weeks, NPC +/+ and -/- mice showed marked difference in protein expressions. Among these, glutamate receptor 2 precursor was identified. The immunohistochemical study on neurotransporters showed that glial GABA transporter (GAT-3) increased in both 4- and 8-week-old NPC -/- mouse and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-6) increased in 8-week-old NPC -/- mouse. Glial glutamate transporter, excitatory amino acids carrier-1 (EAAC1), decreased in 8-week-old NPC -/- mouse. In conclusion, our data may provide insight into the understanding of the basic mechanism through perturbation of protein networks and neurotransporter systems in a single gene knockout model of NPC disease.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen that causes a variety of diseases, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, otitis media, and sinusitis, in both adults and children. The global pattern of growth phase-dependent protein expression of S. pneumoniae during in vitro culture was analyzed using 2-DE combined with MALDI-TOF MS and LC/ESI-MS/MS. Several protein production patterns were observed at four time points throughout the growth stage, although some protein levels did not change significantly. We focused on the switch in protein expression at the transition from log growth phase to stationary phase. Proteins that were significantly induced or repressed at this point are likely to be involved in central intermediary metabolism, amino acid synthesis, nucleotide, and fatty acid metabolism, cell wall synthesis, protein degradation, and stress responses. This global expression profiling approach has revealed previously unrecognized relationships between proteins in the life of this pathogen.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1712-5.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteomics research has developed until recently in a relative isolation from other fast-moving disciplines such as ecology and evolution. This is unfortunate since applying proteomics to these disciplines has apparently the potential to open new perspectives. The huge majority of species indeed exhibit over their entire geographic range a metapopulation structure, occupying habitats that are fragmented and heterogeneous in space and/or through time. Traditionally, population genetics is the main tool used to studying metatopulations, as it describes the spatial structure of populations and the level of gene flow between them. In this Viewpoint, we present the reasons why we think that proteomics, because of the level of integration it promotes, has the potential to resolve interesting issues specific to metapopulation biology and adaptive processes.

<ABSTRACT>
In a recently published article, Campostrini et al. [Proteomics 2005, 5, 2385-2395] raised questions regarding the utility of 2-D gels in proteomics research. We believe that the authors have overlooked several key issues including the dynamic range of protein expression and the sensitivity of the analytical methods used to explore a proteome. We argue that 2-D gels have and will continue to provide meaningful quantitative data when applied to proteomic analysis and that the practical significance of spot overlap has been overstated.

<ABSTRACT>
Embryos of simple chordates called ascidians (sea squirts) have few cells, develop rapidly, and are transparent, enabling the in vivo fluorescent imaging of labeled cell lineages. Ascidians are also simple genetically, with limited redundancy and compact regulatory regions. This cellular and genetic simplicity is now being exploited to link comprehensive gene networks to the cellular events underlying morphogenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
Destruction of intact cellular proteins is largely orchestrated by ATP-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. The REG-20S proteasome, however, only degrades short peptides. In this issue of Cell, challenge this notion by revealing that the proteasomal activator REGgamma directs degradation of the steroid receptor coactivator SRC-3 by the 20S proteasome in an ATP- and ubiquitin-independent manner.

Macrophages within the tumor microenvironment facilitate angiogenesis and extracellular-matrix breakdown and remodeling and promote tumor cell motility. Recent studies reveal that direct communication between macrophages and tumor cells leads to invasion and egress of tumor cells into the blood vessels (intravasation). Thus, macrophages are at the center of the invasion microenvironment and are an important drug target for cancer therapy.

From cell structure to transcription: Hippo forges a new path.

Cell. 2006 Jan 27;124(2):267-73.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The control of cell number during animal development is a longstanding puzzle. Recent studies in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have defined a new signaling pathway that restricts cell proliferation in differentiating epithelia. The cytoskeletal proteins Merlin and Expanded, which play a role in cell adhesion and structure, control the activation of the Hippo/Salvador kinase complex, which in turn activates the Warts/Mats kinase complex. Warts/Mats kinase phosphorylates and inhibits Yorkie, a transcriptional coactivator that positively regulates cell growth, survival, and proliferation. This conserved signaling pathway contains several tumor-suppressor genes and regulates the contact inhibition of proliferation in cultured cells.

Cernunnos, a novel nonhomologous end-joining factor, is mutated in human
immunodeficiency with microcephaly.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Jan 27;124(2):287-99.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur at random upon genotoxic stresses and represent obligatory intermediates during physiological DNA rearrangement events such as the V(D)J recombination in the immune system. DSBs, which are among the most toxic DNA lesions, are preferentially repaired by the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway in higher eukaryotes. Failure to properly repair DSBs results in genetic instability, developmental delay, and various forms of immunodeficiency. Here we describe five patients with growth retardation, microcephaly, and immunodeficiency characterized by a profound T+B lymphocytopenia. An increased cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation, a defective V(D)J recombination, and an impaired DNA-end ligation process both in vivo and in vitro are indicative of a general DNA repair defect in these patients. All five patients carry mutations in the Cernunnos gene, which was identified through cDNA functional complementation cloning. Cernunnos/XLF represents a novel DNA repair factor essential for the NHEJ pathway.

Genomic instability and aging-like phenotype in the absence of mammalian
SIRT6.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Jan 27;124(2):315-29.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Sir2 histone deacetylase functions as a chromatin silencer to regulate recombination, genomic stability, and aging in budding yeast. Seven mammalian Sir2 homologs have been identified (SIRT1-SIRT7), and it has been speculated that some may have similar functions to Sir2. Here, we demonstrate that SIRT6 is a nuclear, chromatin-associated protein that promotes resistance to DNA damage and suppresses genomic instability in mouse cells, in association with a role in base excision repair (BER). SIRT6-deficient mice are small and at 2-3 weeks of age develop abnormalities that include profound lymphopenia, loss of subcutaneous fat, lordokyphosis, and severe metabolic defects, eventually dying at about 4 weeks. We conclude that one function of SIRT6 is to promote normal DNA repair, and that SIRT6 loss leads to abnormalities in mice that overlap with aging-associated degenerative processes.

Structural analysis of strand misalignment during DNA synthesis by a human
DNA polymerase.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Jan 27;124(2):331-42.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Insertions and deletions in coding sequences can alter the reading frame of genes and have profound biological consequences. In 1966, Streisinger proposed that these mutations result from strand slippage, which in repetitive sequences generates misaligned intermediates stabilized by correct base pairing that support polymerization. We report here crystal structures of human DNA polymerase lambda, which frequently generates deletion mutations, bound to such intermediates. Each contains an extrahelical template nucleotide upstream of the active site. Surprisingly, the extra nucleotide, even when combined with an adjacent mismatch, does not perturb polymerase active site geometry, which is indistinguishable from that for correctly aligned strands. These structures reveal how pol lambda can polymerize on substrates with minimal homology during repair of double-strand breaks and represent strand-slippage intermediates consistent with Streisinger's classical hypothesis. They are thus relevant to the origin of single-base deletions, a class of mutations that can confer strong biological phenotypes.

Structural insight into the mechanism of double-stranded RNA processing by
ribonuclease III.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Jan 27;124(2):355-66.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Members of the ribonuclease III (RNase III) family are double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific endoribonucleases characterized by a signature motif in their active centers and a two-base 3' overhang in their products. While Dicer, which produces small interfering RNAs, is currently the focus of intense interest, the structurally simpler bacterial RNase III serves as a paradigm for the entire family. Here, we present the crystal structure of an RNase III-product complex, the first catalytic complex observed for the family. A 7 residue linker within the protein facilitates induced fit in protein-RNA recognition. A pattern of protein-RNA interactions, defined by four RNA binding motifs in RNase III and three protein-interacting boxes in dsRNA, is responsible for substrate specificity, while conserved amino acid residues and divalent cations are responsible for scissile-bond cleavage. The structure reveals a wealth of information about the mechanism of RNA hydrolysis that can be extrapolated to other RNase III family members.

Identification of intrinsic determinants of midbrain dopamine neurons.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Jan 27;124(2):393-405.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The prospect of using cell replacement therapies has raised the key issue of whether elucidation of developmental pathways can facilitate the generation of therapeutically important cell types from stem cells. Here we show that the homeodomain proteins Lmx1a and Msx1 function as determinants of midbrain dopamine neurons, cells that degenerate in patients with Parkinson's disease. Lmx1a is sufficient and required to trigger dopamine cell differentiation. An early activity of Lmx1a is to induce the expression of Msx1, which complements Lmx1a by inducing the proneural protein Ngn2 and neuronal differentiation. Importantly, expression of Lmx1a in embryonic stem cells results in a robust generation of dopamine neurons with a "correct" midbrain identity. These data establish that Lmx1a and Msx1 are critical intrinsic dopamine-neuron determinants in vivo and suggest that they may be essential tools in cell replacement strategies in Parkinson's disease.

Signals from the sympathetic nervous system regulate hematopoietic stem
cell egress from bone marrow.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Jan 27;124(2):407-21.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), attracted by the chemokine CXCL12, reside in specific niches in the bone marrow (BM). HSPC migration out of the BM is a critical process that underlies modern clinical stem cell transplantation. Here we demonstrate that enforced HSPC egress from BM niches depends critically on the nervous system. UDP-galactose ceramide galactosyltransferase-deficient (Cgt(-/-)) mice exhibit aberrant nerve conduction and display virtually no HSPC egress from BM following granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or fucoidan administration. Adrenergic tone, osteoblast function, and bone CXCL12 are dysregulated in Cgt(-/-) mice. Pharmacological or genetic ablation of adrenergic neurotransmission indicates that norepinephrine (NE) signaling controls G-CSF-induced osteoblast suppression, bone CXCL12 downregulation, and HSPC mobilization. Further, administration of a beta(2) adrenergic agonist enhances mobilization in both control and NE-deficient mice. Thus, these results indicate that the sympathetic nervous system regulates the attraction of stem cells to their niche.

Control of the assembly of ATP- and ADP-actin by formins and profilin.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Jan 27;124(2):423-35.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Formin proteins nucleate actin filaments, remaining processively associated with the fast-growing barbed ends. Although formins possess common features, the diversity of functions and biochemical activities raised the possibility that formins differ in fundamental ways. Further, a recent study suggested that profilin and ATP hydrolysis are both required for processive elongation mediated by the formin mDia1. We used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to observe directly individual actin filament polymerization in the presence of two mammalian formins (mDia1 and mDia2) and two yeast formins (Bni1p and Cdc12p). We show that these diverse formins have the same basic properties: movement is processive in the absence or presence of profilin; profilin accelerates elongation; and actin ATP hydrolysis is not required for processivity. These results suggest that diverse formins are mechanistically similar, but the rates of particular assembly steps vary.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1427-36.

<ABSTRACT>
A multiplexed fluorescence immunoassay using a novel planar waveguide technology-based microarray system, ZeptoMARK (Zeptosens), was developed to detect simultaneously urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in extracts of breast cancer tissues. The three analytes assay was cross-validated with single-analyte ELISA/chemiluminescence immunosorbent assay tests, revealing good correlations and enhanced assay sensitivities (LODs) of 1 pg/mL for uPA, 33 pg/mL for PAI-1, and 1 pg/mL for VEGF. Values were well within the 80-120% limits for assay recovery and within the +/-20% limits for assay precision. The uPA, PAI-1, and VEGF results obtained from 50 breast cancer cytosols using the protein array system demonstrated that the microarray-based multiplexed assay is a sensitive and robust tool to be used for the simultaneous quantification of cancer markers in small breast cancer tissue samples (core biopsies). The miniaturized, multiplexed assay format has a potential to be used for the quantitative analysis of a larger set of validated markers with significance in disease management.

Salt stress adaptation of Bacillus subtilis: a physiological proteomics
approach.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1550-62.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The adaptation to osmotic stress is crucial for growth and survival of Bacillus subtilis in its natural ecosystem. Dual channel imaging and warping of 2-D protein gels were used to visualize global changes in the protein synthesis pattern of cells in response to osmotic stress (6% NaCl). Many vegetative enzymes were repressed in response to salt stress and derepressed after resumption of growth. The enzymes catalyzing the metabolic steps from glucose to 2-oxoglutarate, however, were almost constantly synthesized during salt stress despite the growth arrest. This indicates an enhanced need for the proline precursor glutamate. The synthesis of enzymes involved in sulfate assimilation and in the formation of Fe-S clusters was also induced, suggesting an enhanced need for the formation or repair of Fe-S clusters in response to salt stress. One of the most obvious changes in the protein synthesis profile can be followed by the very strong induction of the SigB regulon. Furthermore, members of the SigW regulon and of the PerR regulon, indicating oxidative stress after salt challenge, were also induced. This proteomic approach provides an overview of cell adaptation to an osmotic upshift in B. subtilis visualizing the most dramatic changes in the protein synthesis pattern.

Down-regulation of the strawberry Bet v 1-homologous allergen in concert
with the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway in colorless strawberry mutant.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1574-87.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteomic screening of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) yielded a 58% success rate in protein identification in spite of the fact that no genomic sequence is available for this species. This was achieved by a combination of MALDI-MS/MS de novo sequencing of double-derivatized peptides and indel-tolerant searching against local protein databases built on both EST and full-length nucleotide sequences. The amino acid sequence of a strawberry allergen, homologous to the well-known major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1, was partially determined. This strawberry allergen, named Fra a 1 according to the nomenclature for allergen proteins, showed sequence identity of 54 and 77%, respectively, with corresponding allergens from birch and apple. Differential expression, as evaluated by 2-D DIGE, occurred in 10% of protein spots when red strawberries were compared to a colorless (white) strawberry mutant. White strawberries, known to be tolerated by individuals affected by allergy, were found to be virtually free from the strawberry allergen. Also several enzymes in the pathway for biosynthesis of flavonoids, to which the red color pelargonidin belongs, were down-regulated. This approach to assess differential protein expression without access to genomic sequence information can also be applied to other crop plants and phenotypic traits.

<ABSTRACT>
In the last decade, an increasing number of sequenced archaeal genomes have become available, opening up the possibility for functional genomic analyses. Here, we reconstructed the central carbon metabolism in the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and tricarboxylic acid cycle) on the basis of genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic and biochemical data. A 2-DE reference map of S. solfataricus grown on glucose, consisting of 325 unique ORFs in 255 protein spots, was created to facilitate this study. The map was then used for a differential expression study based on (15)N metabolic labelling (yeast extract + tryptone-grown cells (YT) vs. glucose-grown cells (G)). In addition, the expression ratio of the genes involved in carbon metabolism was studied using DNA microarrays. Surprisingly, only 3 and 14% of the genes and proteins, respectively, involved in central carbon metabolism showed a greater than two-fold change in expression level. All results are discussed in the light of the current understanding of central carbon metabolism in S. solfataricus and will help to obtain a system-wide understanding of this organism.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1399-414.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Progress in proteomic researches is largely determined by development and implementation of new methods for the revelation and identification of proteins in biological material in a wide concentration range (from 10(-3) M to single molecules). The most perspective approaches to address this problem involve (i) nanotechnological physicochemical procedures for the separation of multicomponent protein mixtures; among these of particular interest are biospecific nanotechnological procedures for selection of proteins from multicomponent protein mixtures with their subsequent concentration on solid support; (ii) identification and counting of single molecules by use of molecular detectors. The prototypes of biospecific nanotechnological procedures, based on the capture of ligand biomolecules by biomolecules of immobilized ligate and the concentration of the captured ligands on appropriate surfaces, are well known; these are affinity chromatography, magnetic biobeads technology, different biosensor methods, etc. Here, we review the most promising nanotechnological approaches for selection of proteins and kinetic characterization of their complexes based on these biospecific methods with subsequent MS/MS identification of proteins and protein complexes. Two major groups of methods for the analysis and identification of individual molecules and their complexes by use of molecular detectors will be reviewed: scanning probe microscopy (SPM) (including atomic-force microscopy) and cryomassdetector technology.

<ABSTRACT>
Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse causes time-dependent neuroadaptive changes in the mesocorticolimbic system of the brain that are considered to underlie the expression of major behavioral characteristics of drug addiction. We used a 2-D gel-based proteomics approach to examine morphine-induced temporal changes in protein expression and/or PTM in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of morphine-sensitized rats. Rats were pretreated with saline [1 mL/kg subcutaneously (s.c.)] or morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.) once daily for 14 days and the animals were decapitated 1 day later. The NAc was extracted and proteins resolved by 2-DE. Several protein functional groups were found to be regulated in the morphine-treated group, representing cytoskeletal proteins, proteins involved in neurotransmission, enzymes involved in energy metabolism and protein degradation, and a protein that regulates translation.

<ABSTRACT>
Proteomic profiling with SELDI-TOF MS has facilitated the discovery of disease-specific protein profiles. However, multicenter studies are often hindered by the logistics required for prompt deep-freezing of samples in liquid nitrogen or dry ice within the clinic setting prior to shipping. We report high concordance between MS profiles within sets of quadruplicate split urine and serum samples deep-frozen at 0, 2, 6, and 24 h after sample collection. Gage R&R results confirm that deep-freezing times are not a statistically significant source of SELDI-TOF MS variability for either blood or urine.

BCEC proteins were isolated, separated by 2-DE, and identified by MALDI-MS. Computer-based 2-D gel analysis identified 21 up-regulated proteins and 4 down-regulated proteins after hypoxia alone and 9 proteins that were further up-regulated after posthypoxic reoxygenation. The expression of the majority of hypoxia-induced proteins was reduced toward control levels during reoxygenation. The most prominent changes were identified for glycolytic enzymes (e.g., phosphoglycerate kinase), proteins of the ER (e.g., calreticulin), and cytoskeletal (e.g., vimentin) proteins. The results indicate that BCEC respond to hypoxia/reoxygenation by adaptive up-regulation of proteins involved in the glycolysis, protein synthesis, and stress response.

Proteomic analysis of beryllium-induced genotoxicity in an Escherichia

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1663-75.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Beryllium is the second lightest metal, has a high melting point and high strength-to-weight ratio, and is chemically stable. These unique chemical characteristics make beryllium metal an ideal choice as a component material for a wide variety of applications in aerospace, defense, nuclear weapons, and industry. However, inhalation of beryllium dust or fumes induces significant health effects, including chronic beryllium disease and lung cancer. In this study, the mutagenicity of beryllium sulfate (BeSO(4)) and the comutagenicity of beryllium with a known mutagen 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) were evaluated using a forward mutant detection system developed in Escherichia coli. In this system, BeSO(4) was shown to be weakly mutagenic alone and significantly enhanced the mutagenicity of MNNG up to 3.5-fold over MNNG alone. Based on these results a proteomic study was conducted to identify the proteins regulated by BeSO(4). Using the techniques of 2-DE and oMALDI-TOF MS, we successfully identified 32 proteins being differentially regulated by beryllium and/or MNNG in the E. coli test system. This is the first study to describe the proteins regulated by beryllium in vitro, and the results suggest several potential pathways for the focus of further research into the mechanisms underlying beryllium-induced genotoxicity.

The phosphate-starvation response in Vibrio cholerae O1 and phoB mutant
under proteomic analysis: disclosing functions involved in adaptation,
survival and virulence.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1495-511.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A proteomic analysis of a wild-type and of a phoB mutant showed that Vibrio cholerae expresses genes of two major regulons in response to phosphate starvation. The Pho regulon, expressed by the wild-type, allowed the cells to adapt to the new environment. Induction of the general stress regulon was mainly observed in the phoB mutant as a strategy to resist stress and survive. Some functions of the adaptative and survival responses play roles in the pathogenicity of the bacteria. Among the members of the Pho regulon, we found a porin described as an important factor for the intestinal colonisation. Other functions not obviously related to phosphate metabolism, expressed preferentially by the wild-type cells, have also been implicated in virulence. These findings might explain the lack of virulence of the phoB mutant. The Pho regulon picture of V. cholerae, however, will not be complete until minor members and membrane proteins are identified. Among the phosphate-starvation induced genes we have found 13 hypothetical ones and for some of them functions have been assigned. The majority of the genes identified here have not been described before, thus they could be used to expand the proteomic reference map of V. cholerae El Tor.

Protein profiling the effects of in vitro hyperoxic exposure on fetal
rabbit lung.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1957-62.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that acute in vitro exposure of prematurely delivered fetal rabbit lungs to hyperoxic conditions will induce the expression of an adaptive cassette of proteins that mediates antioxidant and inflammatory processes. To test this hypothesis, ex situ fetal rabbit lung explants were prepared from New Zealand white rabbits delivered by cesarean section on day 29 of gestation and incubated under air (21% O2; 5% CO2) or hyperoxic (95% O2; 5% CO2) atmospheres. Total tissue protein was extracted following incubation and subjected to 2-DE. Using this technique, 1500-2000 protein spots were resolved per gel. Treatment-dependent, differentially expressed proteins were identified by image analysis (Melanie II) and MALDI-TOF MS and MALDI-MS/MS. The analysis identified 12 protein spots that were differentially expressed by 1.5-fold or more (p<0.05) by exposure to hyperoxic conditions. Six of these differentially expressed proteins were identified as vimentin, annexin I, inorganic pyrophosphatase, prohibitin, an N-terminal fragment of ATP synthase and heat shock protein 27. The data obtained are consistent with the roles of these proteins in mediating cellular response to oxidative stress and in regulating cell proliferation.

The tegument surface membranes of the human blood parasite Schistosoma
mansoni: a proteomic analysis after differential extraction.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1471-82.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni can live for years in the hepatic portal system of its human host and so must possess very effective mechanisms of immune evasion. The key to understanding how these operate lies in defining the molecular organisation of the exposed parasite surface. The adult worm is covered by a syncytial tegument, bounded externally by a plasma membrane and overlain by a laminate secretion, the membranocalyx. In order to determine the protein composition of this surface, the membranes were detached using a freeze/thaw technique and enriched by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The resulting preparation was sequentially extracted with three reagents of increasing solubilising power. The extracts were separated by 2-DE and their protein constituents were identified by MS/MS, yielding predominantly cytosolic, cytoskeletal and membrane-associated proteins, respectively. After extraction, the final pellet containing membrane-spanning proteins was processed by liquid chromatographic techniques before MS. Transporters for sugars, amino acids, ions and other solutes were found together with membrane enzymes and proteins concerned with membrane structure. The proteins identified were categorised by their function and putative location on the basis of their homology with annotated proteins in other organisms.

Identification of proteins adducted by reactive metabolites of naphthalene
and 1-nitronaphthalene in dissected airways of rhesus macaques.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Feb;6(3):972-82.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Naphthalene and 1-nitronaphthalene are ambient air pollutants, which undergo P450-dependent bioactivation in the lung. Reactive metabolites of naphthalene and 1-nitronaphthalene covalently bind to proteins, and the formation of covalent adducts correlates with airway epithelial cell injury in rodent models. These studies were designed to identify protein adducts generated from these reactive metabolites within distal respiratory airways. Distal bronchioles and parenchyma from rhesus monkeys were incubated with [(14)C]naphthalene or [(14)C]1-nitronaphthalene. Proteins were separated by 2-DE, blotted to PVDF membranes, and adducted proteins imaged by storage phosphor analysis. MS of in-gel tryptic digests identified numerous adducted proteins including: eight cytoskeletal proteins, two chaperone proteins, seven metabolic enzymes, one redox protein, two proteins involved in ion balance and cell signaling, and two extracellular proteins. While many proteins are adducted by both naphthalene and 1-nitronaphthalene, some are unique to the individual toxicant and airway subcompartment. Although the role which adduction of these proteins plays in cytotoxicity was not evaluated, these studies provide candidate proteins for future work designed to determine the importance of protein adducts in the mechanisms of toxicity and for developing biomarkers useful in determining the relevance of findings in animal models to exposed human populations.

Proteomic analysis reveals a novel role for the actin cytoskeleton in
vincristine resistant childhood leukemia--an in vivo study.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1681-94.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Intrinsic or acquired resistance to vincristine (VCR), an antimicrotubule agent used in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), is a major clinical problem. Using a clinically relevant NOD/SCID mouse xenograft model of ALL, we established that alterations in the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton are involved in in vivo VCR resistance. Altered protein expression between VCR-sensitive ALL xenografts, and xenografts with intrinsic or acquired VCR resistance, was identified using 2-D DIGE coupled with MS. Of the 19 proteins displaying altered expression, 11 are associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Altered expression of the actin- and/or tubulin-binding proteins gelsolin, moesin, ezrin, tropomyosin, CAP-G, HSP27, HSP70, TCP-1, and stathmin were associated with in vivo VCR resistance. The actin-regulating protein gelsolin was increased in both acquired and resistant leukemia as confirmed by immunoblotting and gene expression. The major cytoskeletal protein, gamma-actin, was down-regulated in the VCR-resistant leukemia xenografts; in contrast, there was no significant change in beta-actin expression. This study provides the first evidence for a role of the actin cytoskeleton in intrinsic and acquired in vivo antimicrotubule drug resistance in childhood leukemia and highlights the power of 2-D DIGE for the discovery of resistance markers, pharmacoproteomics, and signaling pathways in cancer.

Outer membrane vesicles from group B Neisseria meningitidis delta gna33

outer membrane vesicles.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1856-66.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We compared the proteome of detergent-derived group B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB) outer membrane vesicles (DOMVs) with the proteome of outer membrane vesicles (m-OMVs) spontaneously released into culture supernatant by MenB delta gna33, a mutant in which the gene coding for a lytic transglycosylase homologous to the E. coli MltA was deleted. In total, 138 proteins were identified in DOMVs by 1- and 2-DE coupled with MS; 64% of these proteins belonged to the inner membrane and cytoplasmic compartments. By contrast, most of the 60 proteins of m-OMVs were classified by PSORT as outer membrane proteins. When tested for their capacity to elicit bactericidal antibodies, m-OMVs elicited a broad protective activity against a large panel of MenB strains. Therefore, the identification of mutations capable of conferring an OMV-releasing phenotype in bacteria may represent an attractive approach to study bacterial membrane composition and organization, and to design new efficacious vaccine formulations.

Protein extraction procedure and the reducing agent content (DTT, dithioerythritol, tributyl phosphine and tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP)) of the sample and rehydration buffers were optimised for European beech leaves and roots and Norway spruce needles. Optimal extraction was achieved with 100 mM DTT for leaves and needles and a mixture of 2 mM TCEP and 50 mM DTT for roots. Performing IEF in buffers containing hydroxyethyldisulphide significantly enhanced the quality of separation for all proteins except for acidic root proteins, which were optimally focused in the same buffer as extracted.

Proteomic and biochemical analyses of in vitro carcinogen-induced lung
cell transformation: synergism between arsenic and benzo[a]pyrene.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1619-30.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Chronic coexposures to carcinogens inorganic arsenic and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) are common in the living environment. However, little is known about their effects exerted at the proteome level. Our previous study in rat lung epithelial cells showed that cell transformation frequency increased by more than 100-fold when arsenic was given in combination with B[a]P than cells either exposed to arsenic or B[a]P alone. This demonstrated a synergism between them. Here, we reported that alterations to the proteome varied and were more pronounced in the transformed cells that were exposed to a combination of arsenic and B[a]P than to B[a]P and much less to arsenic alone when compared to passage-matched control cells. In general, three proteins belonging to intermediate filaments were found to be significantly down-regulated and six proteins belonging to antioxidative stress-, chaperone-, and glycolytic proteins were up-regulated in these transformed cells. These transformed cells were also associated with an increase of proliferation and de-differentiation. Taken together, our findings suggest that although arsenic or B[a]P alone is sufficient to induce cell transformation and alter the proteome to a similar extent, the effects of coexposure are much more pronounced. This further substantiates the notion that these carcinogens act in concert during cocarcinogenesis.

Functional peptide microarrays for specific and sensitive antibody

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Peptide microarrays displaying biologically active small synthetic peptides in a high-density format provide an attractive technology to probe complex samples for the presence and/or function of protein analytes. We present a new approach for manufacturing functional peptide microarrays for molecular immune diagnostics. Our method relies on the efficiency of site-specific solution-phase coupling of biotinylated synthetic peptides to NeutrAvidin (NA) and localized microdispensing of peptide-NA-complexes onto activated glass surfaces. Antibodies are captured in a sandwich manner between surface immobilized peptide probes and fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies. Our work includes a total of 54 peptides derived from immunodominant linear epitopes of the T7 phage capsid protein, Herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D, c-myc protein, and three domains of the Human coronavirus polymerase polyprotein and their cognate mAbs. By using spacer molecules of different type and length for NA-mediated peptide presentation, we show that the incorporation of a minimum spacer length is imperative for antibody binding, whereas the peptide immobilization direction has only secondary importance for antibody affinity and binding. We further demonstrate that the peptide array is capable of detecting low-picomolar concentrations of mAbs in buffered solutions and diluted human serum with high specificity.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1758-69.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In the field of proteomics, the increasing difficulty to unify the data format, due to the different platforms/instrumentation and laboratory documentation systems, greatly hinders experimental data verification, exchange, and comparison. Therefore, it is essential to establish standard formats for every necessary aspect of proteomics data. One of the recently published data models is the proteomics experiment data repository [Taylor, C. F., Paton, N. W., Garwood, K. L., Kirby, P. D. et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 2003, 21, 247-254]. Compliant with this format, we developed the systematic proteomics laboratory analysis and storage hub (SPLASH) database system as an informatics infrastructure to support proteomics studies. It consists of three modules and provides proteomics researchers a common platform to store, manage, search, analyze, and exchange their data. (i) Data maintenance includes experimental data entry and update, uploading of experimental results in batch mode, and data exchange in the original PEDRo format. (ii) The data search module provides several means to search the database, to view either the protein information or the differential expression display by clicking on a gel image. (iii) The data mining module contains tools that perform biochemical pathway, statistics-associated gene ontology, and other comparative analyses for all the sample sets to interpret its biological meaning. These features make SPLASH a practical and powerful tool for the proteomics community.

Genomic imprinting is an essential epigenetic process that controls the size of seeds in flowering plants. In Arabidopsis, DEMETER activates the maternal copy of the imprinted MEDEA Polycomb gene. In this issue of Cell, Gehring et al. (2006) demonstrate that this activation involves DNA demethylation of MEDEA by DEMETER. Remarkably, they also find that silencing of the paternal MEDEA allele is independent of DNA methylation and is controlled by maternal expression of MEDEA itself.

The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a conserved Ser/Thr kinase that regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to environmental cues. Here, highlighting contributions from studies in model organisms, we review mammalian TOR complexes and the signaling branches they mediate. TOR is part of two distinct multiprotein complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1), which is sensitive to rapamycin, and TORC2, which is not. The physiological consequences of mammalian TORC1 dysregulation suggest that inhibitors of mammalian TOR may be useful in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity, and metabolic disorders.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Dengue virus (DENV) is a significant human pathogen that causes millions of infections and results in about 24,000 deaths each year. Dendritic cell-specific ICAM3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), abundant in immature dendritic cells, was previously reported as being an ancillary receptor interacting with the surface of DENV. The structure of DENV in complex with the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of DC-SIGN was determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 25 A resolution. One CRD monomer was found to bind to two glycosylation sites at Asn67 of two neighboring glycoproteins in each icosahedral asymmetric unit, leaving the third Asn67 residue vacant. The vacancy at the third Asn67 site is a result of the nonequivalence of the glycoprotein environments, leaving space for the primary receptor binding to domain III of E. The use of carbohydrate moieties for receptor binding sites suggests a mechanism for avoiding immune surveillance.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
MEDEA (MEA) is an Arabidopsis Polycomb group gene that is imprinted in the endosperm. The maternal allele is expressed and the paternal allele is silent. MEA is controlled by DEMETER (DME), a DNA glycosylase required to activate MEA expression, and METHYLTRANSFERASE I (MET1), which maintains CG methylation at the MEA locus. Here we show that DME is responsible for endosperm maternal-allele-specific hypomethylation at the MEA gene. DME can excise 5-methylcytosine in vitro and when expressed in E. coli. Abasic sites opposite 5-methylcytosine inhibit DME activity and might prevent DME from generating double-stranded DNA breaks. Unexpectedly, paternal-allele silencing is not controlled by DNA methylation. Rather, Polycomb group proteins that are expressed from the maternal genome, including MEA, control paternal MEA silencing. Thus, DME establishes MEA imprinting by removing 5-methylcytosine to activate the maternal allele. MEA imprinting is subsequently maintained in the endosperm by maternal MEA silencing the paternal allele.

A three-protein signaling pathway governing immunity to a bacterial
cannibalism toxin.

<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Feb 10;124(3):549-59.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We describe a three-protein signal-transduction pathway that governs immunity to a protein toxin involved in cannibalism by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Cells of B. subtilis enter the pathway to sporulate under conditions of nutrient limitation but delay becoming committed to spore formation by killing nonsporulating siblings and feeding on the dead cells. Killing is mediated by the exported toxic protein SdpC. We report that extracellular SdpC induces the synthesis of an immunity protein, SdpI, that protects toxin-producing cells from being killed. SdpI, a polytopic membrane protein, is encoded by a two-gene operon under sporulation control that contains the gene for an autorepressor, SdpR. The autorepressor binds to and blocks the promoter for the operon. Evidence indicates that SdpI is also a signal-transduction protein that responds to the SdpC toxin by sequestering the SdpR autorepressor at the membrane. Sequestration relieves repression and stimulates synthesis of immunity protein.

A receptor-modifying deamidase in complex with a signaling phosphatase

Cell. 2006 Feb 10;124(3):561-71.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Signal transduction underlying bacterial chemotaxis involves excitatory phosphorylation and feedback control through deamidation and methylation of sensory receptors. The structure of a complex between the signal-terminating phosphatase, CheC, and the receptor-modifying deamidase, CheD, reveals how CheC mimics receptor substrates to inhibit CheD and how CheD stimulates CheC phosphatase activity. CheD resembles other cysteine deamidases from bacterial pathogens that inactivate host Rho-GTPases. CheD not only deamidates receptor glutamine residues contained within a conserved structural motif but also hydrolyzes glutamyl-methyl-esters at select regulatory positions. Substituting Gln into the receptor motif of CheC turns the inhibitor into a CheD substrate. Phospho-CheY, the intracellular signal and CheC target, stabilizes the CheC:CheD complex and reduces availability of CheD. A point mutation that dissociates CheC from CheD impairs chemotaxis in vivo. Thus, CheC incorporates an element of an upstream receptor to influence both its own effect on receptor output and that of its binding partner, CheD.

<ABSTRACT>
How is the characteristic shape of a membrane bound organelle achieved? We have used an in vitro system to address the mechanism by which the tubular network of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is generated and maintained. Based on the inhibitory effect of sulfhydryl reagents and antibodies, network formation in vitro requires the integral membrane protein Rtn4a/NogoA, a member of the ubiquitous reticulon family. Both in yeast and mammalian cells, the reticulons are largely restricted to the tubular ER and are excluded from the continuous sheets of the nuclear envelope and peripheral ER. Upon overexpression, the reticulons form tubular membrane structures. The reticulons interact with DP1/Yop1p, a conserved integral membrane protein that also localizes to the tubular ER. These proteins share an unusual hairpin topology in the membrane. The simultaneous absence of the reticulons and Yop1p in S. cerevisiae results in disrupted tubular ER. We propose that these "morphogenic" proteins partition into and stabilize highly curved ER membrane tubules.

Macrophage/cancer cell interactions mediate hormone resistance by a
nuclear receptor derepression pathway.

Cell. 2006 Feb 10;124(3):615-29.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Defining the precise molecular strategies that coordinate patterns of transcriptional responses to specific signals is central for understanding normal development and homeostasis as well as the pathogenesis of hormone-dependent cancers. Here we report specific prostate cancer cell/macrophage interactions that mediate a switch in function of selective androgen receptor antagonists/modulators (SARMs) from repression to activation in vivo. This is based on an evolutionarily conserved receptor N-terminal L/HX7LL motif, selectively present in sex steroid receptors, that causes recruitment of TAB2 as a component of an N-CoR corepressor complex. TAB2 acts as a sensor for inflammatory signals by serving as a molecular beacon for recruitment of MEKK1, which in turn mediates dismissal of the N-CoR/HDAC complex and permits derepression of androgen and estrogen receptor target genes. Surprisingly, this conserved sensor strategy may have arisen to mediate reversal of sex steroid-dependent repression of a limited cohort of target genes in response to inflammatory signals, linking inflammatory and nuclear receptor ligand responses to essential reproductive functions.

p120-catenin mediates inflammatory responses in the skin.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Feb 10;124(3):631-44.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Although p120-catenin regulates adherens junction (AJ) stability in cultured cells, genetic studies in lower eukaryotes have not revealed a role for this protein in vivo. Using conditional targeting in mice, we show that p120 null neonatal epidermis exhibits reduced intercellular AJ components but no overt disruption in barrier function or intercellular adhesion. As the mice age, however, they display epidermal hyperplasia and chronic inflammation, typified by hair degeneration and loss of body fat. Using skin engraftments and anti-inflammatory drugs, we show that these features are not attributable to reductions in junctional cadherins and catenins, but rather NFkB activation. Both in vivo and in vitro, p120 null epidermal cells activate nuclear NFkB, triggering a cascade of proinflammatory NFkB targets. Although the underlying mechanism is likely complex, we show that p120 affects NFkB activation and immune homeostasis in part through regulation of Rho GTPases. These findings provide important new insights into p120 function.

Proteomic analysis in human breast cancer: identification of a
characteristic protein expression profile of malignant breast epithelium.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1989-2002.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Gene expression analysis has become a promising tool in predicting the clinical course of malignant disease and the response to antineoplastic therapy. Surprisingly, only little is known about the protein expression pattern of human tumors. Recent advances in proteomic analysis allow proteins of interest to be identified by their expression and/or modification pattern in 2-DE rather than using the traditional approach of translating gene expression data. To identify a proteomic pattern that is characteristic for malignant breast epithelium, we performed differential 2-DE analysis in sets of microdissected malignant breast epithelia and corresponding adjacent normal breast epithelia from five patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Thirty-two protein spots were found to be selectively regulated in malignant epithelium, and were subjected to MALDI-TOF and/or immunoblotting for protein identification. Thirteen of the identified proteins had previously not been associated with breast cancer. The validity of these findings was confirmed by literature review and immunohistochemistry for identified proteins in an independent cohort of 50 breast cancer specimens. We here describe, for the first time, a proteomic analysis of matched normal and malignant epithelia from invasive breast carcinomas. This strategy leads to a better understanding of oncogenesis at an operational level and helps to characterize the malignant phenotype of individual tumors, and thereby to identify novel targets for antineoplastic therapy.

Identification of novel phosphoproteins in signaling pathways triggered by
latent membrane protein 1 using functional proteomics technology.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1810-21.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Previous studies have shown that the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded latent membrane protein1 (LMP1) could activate nuclear factor kappa B, activator protein-1, and Janus kinases/signal transducer and activation of transcription factors pathways. However, many signaling molecules and downstream target proteins triggered by LMP1 have not been identified. To determine the functional components in signaling pathways triggered by LMP1, we combined the novel strategy of phosphoprotein enrichment with proteomics technology to elucidate the signaling cascade activated by LMP1. We found that LMP1 could increase the quantity of total phosphoproteins by 18.03%, and 43 proteins showed significant changes in the degree of phosphorylation when LMP1 was expressed. Twenty-five signaling molecules or downstream targets of signaling pathways triggered by LMP1 were identified, several of which had previously been implicated in LMP1 signal pathways. The other proteins, including annexin A2, heat shock protein 27, stathmin, annexin I, basic transcription factor 3, and porin, were novel signaling molecules or targets with no previously known function in LMP1 signal transduction. The method used here has proven to be suitable for the identification of molecules involved in various signaling pathways.

Comparative proteome approach to characterize the high-pressure stress
response of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DSM 20451(T).

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1878-85.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) exerts diverse effects on microorganisms, leading to stress response and cell death. While inactivation of microorganisms by lethal HHP is well investigated in the context of food preservation and the hygienic safety of minimal food processes, sublethal HHP stress response and its effect on adaptation and cross-protection is less understood. In this study, the HHP stress response of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis was characterized and compared with cold, heat, salt, acid and starvation stress at the proteome level by using 2-DE so as to provide insight into general versus specific stress responses. Sixteen proteins were found to be affected by HHP and were identified by using N-terminal amino acid sequencing and MS. Only one slightly increased protein was specific to the HHP response and showed homology to a clp protease. The other proteins were influenced by most of the investigated stresses in a similar way as HHP. The highest similarity in the HHP proteome was found to be with cold- and NaCl-stressed cells, with 11 overlapping proteins. At the proteome level, L. sanfranciscensis appears to use overlapping subsets of stress-inducible proteins rather than stereotype responses. Our data suggest that a specific pressure response does not exist in this bacteria.

MapQuant: open-source software for large-scale protein quantification.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1770-82.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Whole-cell protein quantification using MS has proven to be a challenging task. Detection efficiency varies significantly from peptide to peptide, molecular identities are not evident a priori, and peptides are dispersed unevenly throughout the multidimensional data space. To overcome these challenges we developed an open-source software package, MapQuant, to quantify comprehensively organic species detected in large MS datasets. MapQuant treats an LC/MS experiment as an image and utilizes standard image processing techniques to perform noise filtering, watershed segmentation, peak finding, peak fitting, peak clustering, charge-state determination and carbon-content estimation. MapQuant reports abundance values that respond linearly with the amount of sample analyzed on both low- and high-resolution instruments (over a 1000-fold dynamic range). Background noise added to a sample, either as a medium-complexity peptide mixture or as a high-complexity trypsinized proteome, exerts negligible effects on the abundance values reported by MapQuant and with coefficients of variance comparable to other methods. Finally, MapQuant's ability to define accurate mass and retention time features of isotopic clusters on a high-resolution mass spectrometer can increase protein sequence coverage by assigning sequence identities to observed isotopic clusters without corresponding MS/MS data.

Analysis of the interacting partners of the neuronal calcium-binding

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1822-32.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Intracellular Ca2+ signals are transduced by the binding of Ca2+ to sensor proteins, which subsequently modify the activity of their target proteins. Identification of these target proteins is, therefore, important for an understanding of cellular signalling processes. We have investigated the binding partners of four EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins. Three proteins of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family, hippocalcin, NCS-1 and neurocalcin delta were prepared as N-terminally tagged GST fusion proteins, and the less closely related protein L-CaBP1 was prepared in both N- and C-terminally tagged forms, the latter requiring generation of a new vector. Immobilised fusion proteins were used to purify binding partners from bovine brain cytosol and membrane extracts in the presence of 1 microM free Ca2+. Bound proteins were eluted with Ca2+-free and high-salt buffers and eluted proteins were identified by MALDI-MS and Western blotting. New protein targets detected included ARF1, Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion 1, cyclic nucleotide 3',5'-phosphodiesterase, the vacuolar ATPase, AP1 and AP2 complexes and the type I TGF-beta receptor. While certain of these interactions occurred with more than one of the Ca2+-binding proteins, others were found to be specific targets for particular Ca2+ sensors, and many of these did not overlap with known calmodulin-binding proteins. These findings provide new clues to the functional roles of the neuronal calcium sensor proteins.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1783-90.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Advanced proteomic research efforts involving areas such as systems biology or biomarker discovery are enabled by the use of high level informatics tools that allow the effective analysis of large quantities of differing types of data originating from various studies. Performing such analyses on a large scale is not feasible without a computational platform that performs data processing and management tasks. Such a platform must be able to provide high-throughput operation while having sufficient flexibility to accommodate evolving data analysis tools and methodologies. The Proteomics Research Information Storage and Management system (PRISM) provides a platform that serves the needs of the accurate mass and time tag approach developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. PRISM incorporates a diverse set of analysis tools and allows a wide range of operations to be incorporated by using a state machine that is accessible to independent, distributed computational nodes. The system has scaled well as data volume has increased over several years, while allowing adaptability for incorporating new and improved data analysis tools for more effective proteomics research.

Quantitation of protein phosphorylation in pregnant rat uteri using stable
isotope dimethyl labeling coupled with IMAC.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1722-34.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Quantitative analysis of protein phosphorylation provides important insights into molecular signaling mechanisms and a better understanding of many cellular processes. In this study, we coupled stable isotope dimethyl labeling with immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) enrichment to quantify protein phosphorylation at MS-determined phosphorylation sites. The proposed method was first characterized using alpha- and beta-casein as two model phosphoproteins, and further applied to the analysis of pregnant rat uteri with and without treatment with 8-bromo-cGMP. Dimethyl labeling has several significant advantages: global, fast (within 5 min) and complete (near 100%). Our results indicate that the labeling has no adverse effect on the IMAC enrichment for tryptic peptides having single and multiple phosphorylation sites. Moreover, the enhanced a1 signal and the complete reaction by dimethyl labeling provide unequivocal identification of both the N-terminal amino acid and the number of the labeling site. Using these two criteria in data validation, which is particularly important for identifying phosphoproteins, we found that the confidence in interpreting dimethyl-labeled peptides had greatly increased. In the analysis of late gestation rat uteri, the abundance ratio between treated and un-treated phosphopeptide signals ranged from 0.51 to 1.69 with an average of around 1.01 +/- 0.25. The obtained ratio of the phosphorylation levels at Ser 15 of HSP27 was further confirmed by the consistent results obtained from Western blot analyses. Based on the analysis of the results, it is interesting to note that the activated cGMP dependent protein kinase G (PKG) seems to affect the phosphorylation of proteins associated with the inhibition of cell migration and proliferation, redistribution of actin-associated proteins, and the increase of protein synthesis in late-gestation uteri. These observations provide important evidence suggesting that activated PKG may play a critical role in the shift of pregnant uteri from proliferative to hypertrophic states.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Pathogenic staphylococci can form biofilms in which they show a higher resistance to antibiotics and the immune defense system than their planktonic counterparts, which suggests that the cells in a biofilm have an altered metabolic activity. Here, 2-D PAGE was used to identify secreted, cell wall-associated and cytoplasmic proteins expressed in Staphylococcus aureus after 8 and 48 h of growth. The proteins were separated at pH ranges of 4-7 or 6-11. The protein patterns revealed significant differences in 427 protein spots; from these, 258 non-redundant proteins were identified using ESI-MS/MS. Biofilm cells expressed higher levels of proteins associated with cell attachment and peptidoglycan synthesis, and in particular fibrinogen-binding proteins. Enzymes involved in pyruvate and formate metabolism were upregulated. Furthermore, biofilm cells expressed more staphylococcal accessory regulator A protein (SarA), which corroborates the positive effect of SarA on the expression of the intercellular adhesion operon ica and biofilm growth. In contrast, proteins, such as proteases and particularly immunodominant antigen A (IsaA) and staphylococcal secretory antigen (SsaA), were found in lower amounts. The RNA expression profiling largely supports the proteomic data. The results were mapped onto KEGG pathways.

Proteomic characterization of the effects of clofibrate on protein
expression in rat liver.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1915-33.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Clofibrate is a peroxisome proliferator known to induce liver tumours in rats. A proteomics study was conducted to provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of clofibrate-induced non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogenesis. Rats were treated with 250 mg/kg day clofibrate orally and sacrificed after 7 days. Proteins extracted from the liver were analysed by 2-DE using DIGE technology. The protein identification performed by MS showed that clofibrate induced up-regulation of 77 proteins and down-regulation of 27 proteins. The highest expression ratios corresponded to proteins involved in a series of biochemical pathways such as lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, protein metabolism, citric acid cycle, xenobiotic detoxification and oxidative stress. Proteins implicated in cell proliferation and apoptosis, such as prohibitin, 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, senescence marker protein-30, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase and vimentin, were also identified as being regulated. These results provide leads for further investigations into the molecular mechanisms of liver tumours induced by clofibrate. In addition, MS results showed that a series of regulated proteins were detected as several spots corresponding to different pI and/or M(r). Differential effects on those variants could result from specific PTM and could be a specific molecular signature of the clofibrate-induced protein expression modulation in rat liver.

<ABSTRACT>
The emergence of highly virulent community acquired Staphylococcus aureus and continued progression of resistance to multiple antimicrobials, including methicillin and vancomycin, marks the reemergence of S. aureus as a serious health care threat. Investigation of proteins localized to the cell surface could help to elucidate mechanisms of virulence and antibiotic resistance in S. aureus. In this study, proteomic profiling methods were developed to solubilize, display, and evaluate abundance levels of proteins present in the supernatants of the lysostaphin-digested cell envelope from cultured vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) cells. Combining approaches of 2-DE or chromatographic separation of proteins with MS analyses resulted in the identification of 144 proteins of particular interest. Of these proteins, 48 contained predicted cell wall localization or export signal motifs, including 14 with distinct covalent peptidoglycan-anchor sites, four of which are uncharacterized to date. One of the two most abundant cell envelope proteins, which showed remarkably high variations in MW and pI in the 2-DE gel display, was the S. aureus surface protein G. The display of numerous secreted proteins that are not covalently cell wall-anchored, suggests that, in the exponential growth phase, secreted proteins can be retained physiologically in the cell envelope and may interact with cell wall-anchored proteins and carbohydrate structures in a manner yet to be determined. The remaining 96 proteins, devoid of recognizable motifs, were repeatedly profiled in the VISA cell envelope fractions. We describe a novel semiquantitative method to determine abundance factors of such proteins in 2-DE gels of cell envelope fractions relative to whole cell lysates and discuss these data in the context of true cell envelope localization versus experimentally caused cell lysis.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1963-75.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Novel prognostic biomarkers are imperatively needed to help direct treatment decisions by typing subgroups of node-negative breast cancer patients. The current study has used a proteomic approach of SELDI-TOF-MS screening to identify differentially cytosolic expressed proteins with a prognostic impact in 30 node-negative breast cancer patients with no relapse versus 30 patients with metastatic relapse. The data analysis took into account 73 peaks, among which 2 proved, by means of univariate Cox regression, to have a good cumulative prognostic-informative power. Repeated random sampling (n = 500) was performed to ensure the reliability of the peaks. Optimized thresholds were then computed to use both peaks as risk factors and, adding them to the St. Gallen ones, improve the prognostic classification of node-negative breast cancer patients. Identification of ubiquitin and ferritin light chain (FLC), corresponding to the two peaks of interest, was obtained using ProteinChip LDI-Qq-TOF-MS. Differential expression of the two proteins was further confirmed by Western blotting analyses and immunohistochemistry. SELDI-TOF-MS protein profiling clearly showed that a high level of cytosolic ubiquitin and/or a low level of FLC were associated with a good prognosis in breast cancer.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Lipid particles (LP) of all types of cells are a depot of neutral lipids. The present investigation deals with the isolation of LP from the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica and the characterization of their lipid and protein composition. Properties of LP varied depending on the carbon source. LP from glucose-grown cells revealed a mean diameter of 650 nm with a hydrophobic core mainly formed of triacylglycerols (TAG) and a minor amount of steryl esters (SE). Oleic acid was the major fatty acid species esterified in LP. When cells were grown on oleic acid, LP size increased 3.8-fold, the particles exhibited a significantly lower ratio of TAG to SE, and the relative amount of oleic acid in LP lipids increased compared to cells grown on glucose. Analysis of LP proteins revealed an increasing number of polypeptides when cells were shifted from glucose- to oleic acid-containing medium. Twenty-one major LP proteins were identified under both growth conditions, and additional nine polypeptides were specific for growth on oleic acid. Identification of these proteins by MS and comparison of the deduced ORFs to those from Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that most proteins of Y. lipolytica LP are involved in lipid metabolism. LP proteins specific for growth on oleic acid are also enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, but some of them are also components of the intracellular traffic machinery. Thus, proteom analysis of LP proteins suggests involvement of this compartment in different cell biological processes.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The immunogenic nonhuman carbohydrate sequences in membrane proteins from porcine kidney were identified and characterized using MALDI-TOF MS and ESI-QTOF-MS. The MALDI profile, investigated by incubation with exoglycosidases, showed a series of about 40 carbohydrates that were identified as high mannose glycans (Man(3-9)GlcNAc2) and complex bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary glycans with and without core fucose. The antennae of many of the complex glycans were terminated with alpha-galactose residues, with the numbers of these residues ranging from one up to the number of antennae. Negative ion ESI-MS/MS spectra confirmed the location of the alpha-galactose residues on the ends of the antennae. This total glycan profile of the membrane proteins from porcine kidney will thus provide important information for the study of molecular interactions between antigenic carbohydrates and proteins in xenotransplantation.

<ABSTRACT>
Proteomic analysis of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 cultured in monocyclic aromatic compounds was performed using 2-DE/MS and cleavable isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) to determine whether proteins involved in aromatic compound degradation pathways were altered as predicted by genomic analysis (Jimenez et al., Environ Microbiol. 2002, 4, 824-841). Eighty unique proteins were identified by 2-DE/MS or MS/MS analysis from P. putida KT2440 cultured in the presence of six different organic compounds. Benzoate dioxygenase (BenA, BenD) and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (CatA) were induced by benzoate. Protocatechuate 3,4-dixoygenase (PcaGH) was induced by p-hydroxybenzoate and vanilline. beta-Ketoadipyl CoA thiolase (PcaF) and 3-oxoadipate enol-lactone hydrolase (PcaD) were induced by benzoate, p-hydroxybenzoate and vanilline, suggesting that benzoate, p-hydroxybenzoate and vanilline were degraded by different dioxygenases and then converged in the same beta-ketoadipate degradation pathway. An additional 110 proteins, including 19 proteins from 2-DE analysis, were identified by cleavable ICAT analysis for benzoate-induced proteomes, which complemented the 2-DE results. Phenylethylamine exposure induced beta-ketoacyl CoA thiolase (PhaD) and ring-opening enzyme (PhaL), both enzymes of the phenylacetate (pha) biodegradation pathway. Phenylalanine induced 4-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate dioxygenase (Hpd) and homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HmgA), key enzymes in the homogentisate degradation pathway. Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AphC) was induced under all aromatic compounds conditions. These results suggest that proteome analysis complements and supports predictive information obtained by genomic sequence analysis.

Proteases and chaperones are the most abundant proteins in the
parasitophorous vacuole of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1563-73.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
After invasion of erythrocytes, the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum resides within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) which forms an interface between the host cell cytosol and the parasite surface. This vacuole protects the parasite from potentially harmful substances, but allows access of essential nutrients to the parasite. Furthermore, the vacuole acts as a transit compartment for parasite proteins en route to the host cell cytoplasm. Recently we developed a strategy to biotin label soluble proteins of the PV. Here, we have paired this strategy with a high-throughput MALDI-TOF-MS analysis to identify 27 vacuolar proteins. These proteins fall into the following main classes: chaperones, proteases, and metabolic enzymes, consistent with the expected functions of the vacuole. These proteins are likely to be involved in several processes including nutrient acquisition from the host cytosol, protein sorting within the vacuole, and release of parasites at the end of the intraerythrocytic cycle.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1750-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Insoluble expression of heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli is a major bottleneck of many structural genomics and high-throughput protein biochemistry projects. Many of these proteins may be amenable to refolding, but their identification is hampered by a lack of high-throughput methods. We have developed a matrix-assisted refolding approach in which correctly folded proteins are distinguished from misfolded proteins by their elution from affinity resin under non-denaturing conditions. Misfolded proteins remain adhered to the resin, presumably via hydrophobic interactions. The assay can be applied to insoluble proteins on an individual basis but is particularly well suited for high-throughput applications because it is rapid, automatable and has no rigorous sample preparation requirements. The efficacy of the screen is demonstrated on small-scale expression samples for 15 proteins. Refolding is then validated by large-scale expressions using SEC and circular dichroism.

In addition to their role in regulating signal transduction, multiple functions have been proposed, such as anchorage of receptors, trafficking of cholesterol, and regulation of permeability. However, an extensive understanding of their protein composition in human heart, both in failing and non-failing conditions, is not yet available. Membrane microdomains were isolated from left ventricular tissue of both failing (n = 15) and non-failing (n = 15) human hearts. Protein composition and differential protein expression was explored by comparing series of 2-D maps and subsequent identification by LC-MS/MS analysis. Data indicated that heart membrane microdomains are enriched in chaperones, cytoskeletal-associated proteins, enzymes and protein involved in signal transduction pathway. In addition, differential protein expression profile revealed that 30 proteins were specifically up- or down-regulated in human heart failure membrane microdomains. This study resulted in the identification of human heart membrane microdomain protein composition, which was not previously available. Moreover, it allowed the identification of multiple proteins whose expression is altered in heart failure, thus opening new perspectives to determine which role they may play in this disease.

<ABSTRACT>
Serum is believed to harbor thousands of distinct proteins that are either actively secreted or leak from various blood cells or tissues. Exploring protein composition in serum may accelerate the discovery of novel protein biomarkers for specific economic traits in livestock species. This study analyzed serum protein composition to establish a 2-DE reference map, and monitored protein dynamics of single-comb White Leghorn hens at 8, 19 and 23 weeks after hatching. A total of 119 CBB-stained and 315 silver-stained serum protein spots were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Of these, 98 CBB-stained and 94 silver-stained protein spots were significantly matched to existing chicken proteins. The identified spots represented 30 distinctive proteins in the serum of laying hens. To compare protein expression during development, expression levels of 47 protein spots were quantified by relative spot volume with Melanie 3 software. Ten protein spots increased and 3 protein spots decreased as hen age increased. Previous research has suggested that some of these proteins play critical roles in egg production. The differentially expressed proteins with unknown identities will be valuable candidates for further explorations of their roles in egg production of laying hens.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The proteome of a proliferating human stem cell line was analyzed and then utilized to detect stem cell differentiation-associated changes in the protein profile. The analysis was conducted with a stable human fetal midbrain stem cell line (ReNcell VM) that displays the properties of a neural stem cell. Therefore, acquisition of proteomic data should be representative of cultured human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in general. Here we present a 2-DE protein-map of this cell line with annotations of 402 spots representing 318 unique proteins identified by MS. The subsequent proteome profiling of differentiating cells of this stem cell line at days 0, 4 and 7 of differentiation revealed changes in the expression of 49 identified spots that could be annotated to 45 distinct proteins. This differentiation-associated expression pattern was validated by Western blot analysis for transgelin-2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, as well as peroxiredoxin 1 and 4. The group of regulated proteins also included NudC, ubiquilin-1, STRAP, stress-70 protein, creatine kinase B, glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin. Our results reflect the large rearrangement of the proteome during the differentiation process of the stem cells to terminally differentiated neurons and offer the possibility for further characterization of specific targets driving the stem cell differentiation.

A broad-spectrum fluorescence-based peptide library for the rapid

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2112-20.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Identification of peptide substrates for proteases can be a major undertaking. To overcome issues such as feasibility and deconvolution, associated with large peptide libraries, a 'small but smart' generic fluorescence resonance energy transfer rapid endopeptidase profiling library (REPLi) was synthesised as a tool for rapidly identifying protease substrates. Within a tripeptide core, flanked by Gly residues, similar amino acids were paired giving rise to a relatively small library of 3375 peptides divided into 512 distinct pools each containing only 8 peptides. The REPLi was validated with trypsin, pepsin, the matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-12 and MMP-13 and calpains-1 and -2. In the case of calpain-2, a single iteration step involving LC-MS, provided the definitive residue specificity from which a highly sensitive fluorogenic substrate, (FAM)-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gln-Leu-Tyr-Gly-Gly-DPA-Arg-Arg-Lys-(TAMRA), was then designed. The thorough validation of this 'small but smart' peptide library with representatives from each of the four mechanistic protease classes indicates that the REPLi will be useful for the rapid identification of substrates for multiple proteases.

Analysis of the wheat and Puccinia triticina (leaf rust) proteomes during
a susceptible host-pathogen interaction.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1897-907.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Wheat leaf rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia triticina. The genetics of resistance follows the gene-for-gene hypothesis, and thus the presence or absence of a single host resistance gene renders a plant resistant or susceptible to a leaf rust race bearing the corresponding avirulence gene. To investigate some of the changes in the proteomes of both host and pathogen during disease development, a susceptible line of wheat infected with a virulent race of leaf rust were compared to mock-inoculated wheat using 2-DE (with IEF pH 4-8) and MS. Up-regulated protein spots were excised and analyzed by MALDI-QqTOF MS/MS, followed by cross-species protein identification. Where possible MS/MS spectra were matched to homologous proteins in the NCBI database or to fungal ESTs encoding putative proteins. Searching was done using the MASCOT search engine. Remaining unmatched spectra were then sequenced de novo and queried against the NCBInr database using the BLAST and MS BLAST tools. A total of 32 consistently up-regulated proteins were examined from the gels representing the 9-day post-infection proteome in susceptible plants. Of these 7 are host proteins, 22 are fungal proteins of known or hypothetical function and 3 are unknown proteins of putative fungal origin.

Relative and absolute quantitative expression profiling of cytochromes
P450 using isotope-coded affinity tags.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1934-47.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The development of a novel method for absolute quantification of proteins based on isotope-coded affinity tagging using ICAT reagents is described. The method exploits synthetic peptide standards to determine protein content at the femtomole level in biological samples. The approach is generally applicable to any subset of proteins, but is particularly appropriate for quantitative analysis of multiple, closely related isoforms, and for hydrophobic proteins that are poorly represented in 2-D gels. Relative and absolute quantification techniques are applied to an important group of microsomal metabolic enzymes, the cytochromes P450 (P450), which are critical in determining the disposition, safety and efficacy of drugs in man. Measurement of the P450 induction profile in response to chemicals is a fundamental aspect of drug safety evaluation and is currently achieved by low-throughput methods employing poorly discriminatory antibodies or substrates. Tagging technology is shown to supersede conventional methods for P450 profiling in terms of discriminatory power and throughput, exemplified by the simultaneous detection of distinct induction profiles for cyp2c subfamily members in response to phenobarbitone: cyp2c29 expression, but not cyp2c40 or cyp2c50, was induced threefold by treatment. This technology should abbreviate the drug development pathway, and provide a widely applicable, rapid means of quantifying proteins.

<ABSTRACT>
Construction and microscopic imaging of protein fusions to green fluorescent protein (GFP) have revolutionised our understanding of bacterial structure and function. We have undertaken a systematic study of the localisation of over 100 Bacillus subtilis proteins, following the development of high-throughput construction and analysis procedures. We focused on proteins linked in various ways to the DNA replication machinery, as well as on proteins exemplifying a range of other cellular functions and structures. The results validate the approach as a way of obtaining systematic protein localisation information. They also provide a range of novel biological insights, particularly through the identification of a number of proteins not previously known to be associated with the DNA replication factory.

Differential protein expression in hypertrophic heart with and without

<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1948-56.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Although cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension has been well recognized, the molecular mechanisms for the development of hypertrophy are still largely unknown. In this study, the protein expression profiles of left ventricular myocardia in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats at different ages were analyzed using 2-DE in combination with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS. The results showed that 20 proteins were modulated in the hypertrophic myocardium. Out of these modulated proteins, 13 proteins presented significant changes in SHR at an early stage prior to the development of sustained hypertension, while the changes of the other 7 protein expressions occurred only at a late stage in SHR when the blood pressure was significantly elevated, and were largely reversible by treatment with rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors losartan or enalapril. These data demonstrate that the changes in energy metabolism in the hypertrophied heart favor an increase in glycolysis and a decrease in oxidation of fatty acid and glucose, which occur at an early stage in SHR without hypertension. Our results also provide evidence to support the hypothesis that oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A technique of fluorescence multiplexing is described for analysis of the plasma membrane proteome of colorectal cancer cells from surgically resected specimens, enabling detection and immunophenotyping when the cancer cells are in the minority. A single-cell suspension was prepared from a colorectal tumour, and the mixed population of cells was captured on a CD antibody microarray. The cancer cells were detected using a fluorescently tagged antibody for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA-Alexa647) or epithelial cell adhesion marker (EpCAM-Alexa488). Using this multiplexing procedure, dot patterns from colorectal cancers were distinct from those of adjacent normal tissue. Subtraction of the expression levels for each antigen from normal tissue from those for the cancer shows differential expression in the cancer of CD66c, CD15s, CD55, CD45, CD71, CD45RO, CD11b and CEA, in descending order. Cells captured on the same microarray were also labelled with fluorescent CD3-phycoerythrin antibody revealing the presence of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. The immunophenotypes of T lymphocytes from the tumour samples showed differential expression of HLA-DR, TCR alpha/beta, CD49d, CD52, CD49e, CD5, CD95, CD28, CD38 and CD71, in descending order. Fluorescence multiplexing of mixed cell populations captured on a single antibody microarray enables expression profiling of multiple sub-populations of cells within a tumour sample.

Optimizing search conditions for the mass fingerprint-based identification

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2079-85.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The two central problems in protein identification by searching a protein sequence collection with MS data are the optimal use of experimental information to allow for identification of low abundance proteins and the accurate assignment of the probability that a result is false. For comprehensive MS-based protein identification, it is necessary to choose an appropriate algorithm and optimal search conditions. We report a systematic study of the quality of PMF-based protein identifications under different sequence collection search conditions using the Probability algorithm, which assigns the statistical significance to each result. We employed 2244 PMFs from 2-DE-separated human blood plasma proteins, and performed identification under various search constraints: mass accuracy (0.01-0.3 Da), maximum number of missed cleavage sites (0-2), and size of the sequence collection searched (5.6 x 10(4)-1.8 x 10(5)). By counting the number of significant results (significance levels 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001) for each condition, we demonstrate the search condition impact on the successful outcome of proteome analysis experiments. A mass correction procedure utilizing mass deviations of albumin matching peptides was tested in an attempt to improve the statistical significance of identifications and iterative searching was employed for identification of multiple proteins from each PMF.

Comparative proteome analysis of subcellular fractions from Borrelia
burgdorferi by NEPHGE and IPG.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2121-34.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease, produces excessive amounts of membrane lipoproteins such as outer surface protein A (OspA) when grown in vitro, and consequently many low or moderately abundant proteins are underrepresented when cell lysates are examined by 2-DE. We analyzed the B. burgdorferi B31 proteome computationally and by IPG or modified NEPHGE after subcellular fractionation into membrane-associated and soluble proteins. The B. burgdorferi B31 theoretical proteome is comprised of 1623 proteins and has a mean pI of 8.36 and a median pI of 9.03 with 68% of the proteome possessing a pI >/=7.5. Separation of soluble proteins by IPG resulted in 205 individual spots and identification of 78 protein spots by MALDI-TOF MS. Separation by modified NEPHGE routinely resulted in approximately 185 soluble and 160 membrane protein spots with the identification of 88 individual protein spots combined by MALDI-TOF MS. Homologues to GroEL and aminopeptidase I were present in greater amounts in the membrane faction, with enolase at nearly equivalent amounts in the soluble and membrane fractions. Identification of proteins isolated and separated by such methods will enable future determination of proteome changes in membrane and soluble protein fractions as spirochetes adapt to their changing environments.

A proteomic approach to verify in vivo expression of a novel gamma-gliadin
containing an extra cysteine residue.

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1908-14.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Gliadins and glutenins are the main protein fractions present in wheat gluten. They are responsible for technological and nutritional quality of wheat based products. In particular, glutenins are mainly responsible for dough visco-elastic properties, whereas gliadins confer extensibility to dough and are the most important factor triggering celiac disease, the major human intolerance to gluten. Gliadins are monomeric proteins, whereas glutenins are polymers stabilized by disulfide bonds. Although they have distinctive structural characteristics, it is possible that some gliadins become part of the glutenin fraction because of mutations that affect cysteine number and distribution. Here, we provide evidence that a naturally mutated gamma-gliadin with an extra cysteine residue is incorporated into the polymeric fraction. This goal was achieved using an integrated approach involving heterologous expression, 2-DE, RP-HPLC and MS.

<ABSTRACT>
A network governing DNA integrity was identified in yeast by a global genetic analysis of synthetic fitness or lethality defect (SFL) interactions. Within this network, 16 functional modules or minipathways were defined based on patterns of global SFL interactions. Modules or genes involved in DNA replication, DNA-replication checkpoint (DRC) signaling, and oxidative stress response were identified as the major guardians against lethal spontaneous DNA damage, efficient repair of which requires the functions of the DNA-damage checkpoint signaling and multiple DNA-repair pathways. This genome-wide genetic interaction network also identified novel components (DIA2, NPT1, HST3, HST4, and the CSM1 module) that potentially contribute to mitotic DNA replication and genomic stability and revealed novel functions of well-studied genes (the CTF18 module) in DRC signaling. This network will guide more detailed characterization of mechanisms governing DNA integrity in yeast and other organisms.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a leading cause of congestive heart failure. The exact mechanisms that control cardiac growth and regulate the transition to failure are not fully understood, in part due to the lack of a complete inventory of proteins associated with LVH. We investigated the proteomic basis of LVH using the transverse aortic constriction model of pressure overload in mice coupled with a multidimensional approach to identify known and novel proteins that may be relevant to the development and maintenance of LVH. We identified 123 proteins that were differentially expressed during LVH, including LIM proteins, thioredoxin, myoglobin, fatty acid binding protein 3, the abnormal spindle-like microcephaly protein (ASPM), and cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and myosin. In addition, proteins with unknown functions were identified, providing new directions for future research in this area. We also discuss common pitfalls and strategies to overcome the limitations of current proteomic technologies. Together, the multidimensional approach provides insight into the proteomic changes that occur in the LV during hypertrophy.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2147-56.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Candida albicans is an important human pathogen that causes systemic infections, predominantly among populations with weakened immune systems. The morphological transition from the yeast to the hyphal state is one of the key factors in C. albicans pathogenesis. Owing to their location at the host-pathogen interface, the cell wall and associated proteins are of interest, especially with respect to the yeast to hyphal transition. This study entailed the proteomic analysis of differentially regulated proteins involved in this transition. The protein profiles of C. albicans DTT/SDS-extractible proteins and the cyanogen bromide (CNBr)/trypsin-extractable proteins of a cell wall-enriched fraction from yeast and hyphae were compared. In total, 107 spots were identified from the DTT/SDS-extractible cell wall-enriched fraction, corresponding to 82 unique proteins. Of these DTT/SDS-extractible proteins, 14 proteins were upregulated and 10 were downregulated in response to hyphal induction. Approximately 6-9% of total cell wall-protein-enriched fraction was found to be resistant to DTT/SDS extraction. Analysis of the DTT/SDS-resistant fraction using a CNBr/trypsin extraction resulted in the identification of 29 proteins. Of these, 17 were identified only in the hyphae, four were identified only in the yeast, and eight were identified in both the yeast and hyphae.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2259-72.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a common malignancy with a very low 5-year survival rate. Currently, there are no valid markers for early detection and targets for therapy. Here, we used 2-DE to analyze the protein profiles of eight PDAC specimens and paired adjacent nontumor tissues. MS was used to identify 15 protein spots that were found to be overexpressed in PDAC tissues versus adjacent controls. One of them was identified as phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) 1, a secretable glycolytic enzyme known to participate in angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis of 63 PDAC specimens revealed moderate to strong expression of PGK1 in >70% of the tumors. Further Western blotting analysis of cells from tumor and adjacent nontumor tissues obtained by laser capture microdissection confirmed the enhanced expression of PGK1 in tumor cells. Furthermore, the serum levels of PGK1 were significantly higher in PDAC patients (n = 21) than in the control group (n = 25) (p < 0.005), as determined by ELISA. These observations indicate that protein profile analysis using a combination of 2-DE and MS provides an effective strategy for identifying biomarkers that may have diagnostic potential for PDAC, and identify PGK1 as a potential biomarker and/or therapeutic target for PDAC.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The physiological role of proteins phosphorylated on serine/threonine/tyrosine (Ser/Thr/Tyr) residues or the identity of the corresponding kinases and phosphatases is generally poorly understood in bacteria. As a first step in analysing the importance of such phosphorylation, we sought to establish the nature of the Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphoproteome in Bacillus subtilis, using in vivo labelling with [(32)P]-orthophosphate, one-unit pH 2-DE, combined with MS. Highly reproducible 2-D profiles of phosphoproteins were obtained with early stationary-phase cells. The 2-D profiles contained at least 80 clearly labelled spots in the pH range 4-7. Forty-six spots were analysed by MS (confirmed in most cases by LC-MS/MS), identifying a total of 29 different proteins, with 19 identified for the first time as bacterial phosphoproteins. These phosphoproteins are implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes, including carbon and energy metabolism, transport, stress and development. Significant changes to the profiles were obtained as a result of cold, heat or osmotic shock, demonstrating that, in stationary-phase cells, the phosphoproteome is dynamic. An initial comparative study indicated that at least 25 [(32)P]-labelled spots were also stained by Pro-Q Diamond, with apparently six additional phosphoproteins uniquely detected by Pro-Q.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2199-207.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A proteomic approach was used to study the responses of Taxus cuspidata cells to local microenvironments in different zones of immobilized support matrices. Analysis of protein spots by 2-DE revealed significant differences in the abundance of 31 spots, 28 spots, and 23 spots in outer, middle, and central zone cells between the immobilized and suspended cells. Six of these proteins, identified by MALDI-TOF-MS, were involved in the regulation of carbohydrate, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolisms. Immobilization triggered an increase in taxol production of the immobilized cells in the middle and central zones compared to that of the suspended cells. A negative relation between taxol production and the mitotic index was observed in the cells in the immobilization support matrix. Cells in the outer zone had high mitotic index and low taxol production, while cells in the middle and central zones showed low mitotic index and high taxol production. The abundance of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, which was identified as one of the differentially expressed proteins, was positively correlated to the cell division activity in the immobilized cell cultures.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In agricultural sciences, proteomics has become the new hope for analyzing the meat quality traits that are closely related to the skeletal muscle traits. 2-DE muscle maps of many species have been recently reported and used to find molecular markers of meat quality traits. However, one limitation of 2-DE based analyses is due to the limited alkaline protein separation. Considering this problem, there is a need to use recent advances that have markedly improved the 2-DE based analysis of alkaline proteins. Hence, the present study provides additional information concerning the alkaline proteome of bovine skeletal muscle by using an appropriate protocol to characterize proteins over the entire range of pH 7-11. A total of 32 distinct gene products corresponding to 60 protein spots were identified by PMF and grouped in seven categories according to their main function. This 2-D map will contribute to muscle proteome studies since a significant portion of proteins is in the alkaline pH range.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2286-94.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have employed SELDI-TOF MS to screen for differentially expressed proteins in plasma samples from 27 patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and 26 healthy controls. One ion (m/z approximately 8600) that was found to be elevated in IPAH was validated by SELDI-TOF MS analysis of a second and separate set of plasma samples comprising 30 IPAH patients and 19 controls. The m/z 8600 was purified from plasma by sequential ion exchange and reverse-phase chromatographies and SDS-PAGE. It was identified, following trypsin digestion, by MS peptide analysis as the complement component, complement 4a (C4a) des Arg. Plasma levels of C4a des Arg measured by ELISA confirmed that the levels were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in IPAH patients (2.12 +/- 0.27 microg/mL) compared with normal controls (0.53 +/- 0.05 microg/mL). A cut-off level of 0.6 microg/mL correctly classified 92% of IPAH patients and 80% of controls. Further studies will be needed to determine its performance as a diagnostic biomarker, whether used alone or in combination with other biomarkers. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that putative biomarkers characteristic of IPAH can be identified using a conjoint SELDI-TOF MS - proteomics approach.

Surface plasmon resonance imaging protein arrays for analysis of triple
protein interactions of HPV, E6, E6AP, and p53.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2108-11.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have developed a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based protein microarray to study protein-protein interactions in a high-throughput mode. As a model system, triple protein interactions have been explored with human papillomaviral E6 protein, tumor suppressor p53, and ubiquitin ligase E6AP. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to be a causative agent of cervical cancer. Upon infection, the viral E6 protein forms a heterotrimeric protein complex with p53 and E6AP. The formation of the complex eventually results in the degradation of p53. In the present study, a GST-fused E6AP protein was layered onto a glutathione (GSH)-modified gold chip surface. The specific binding of GST-E6AP protein onto the gold chip surface was facilitated through the affinity of GST to its specific ligand GSH. The interacting proteins (E6 and/or p53) were then spotted. Detection of the interaction was performed using a SPR imaging (SPRI) technique. The resulting SPRI intensity data showed that the protein-protein interactions of E6AP, E6, and p53 were detected in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the SPRI-based microarray system can be an effective tool to study protein-protein interactions where multiple proteins are involved.

Successful establishment of infection by bacterial pathogens requires adhesion to host cells, colonization of tissues, and in certain cases, cellular invasion-followed by intracellular multiplication, dissemination to other tissues, or persistence. Bacteria use monomeric adhesins/invasins or highly sophisticated macromolecular machines such as type III secretion systems and retractile type IV pili to establish a complex host/pathogen molecular crosstalk that leads to subversion of cellular functions and establishment of disease.

These insights are revolutionizing our understanding of endocytosis and the movement of vesicles within cells. In addition, such insights reveal new targets for attacking viruses before they can usurp the host-cell machinery for replication.

<ABSTRACT>
Microtubule-mediated transport of macromolecules and organelles (also known as "cargo") is essential for cells to function. Deficiencies in cytoplasmic transport are frequently associated with severe diseases and syndromes. Cytoplasmic transport also provides viruses with the means to reach their site of replication and is the route for newly assembled progeny to leave the infected cell. This parasitic relationship of viruses with the host cytoskeleton provides an excellent basis for cell biologists to unlock the secrets of cytoplasmic transport and unravel mechanisms of disease. Recent advances in live cell imaging and computational tracking of fluorescently labeled viruses are now revealing how complex the movements of single viruses are in infected cells. This review focuses on microtubule-based motility of viruses and highlights the mechanisms regulating cytoplasmic transport.

Invasion of red blood cells by malaria parasites.

Cell. 2006 Feb 24;124(4):755-66.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The malaria parasite is the most important member of the Apicomplexa, a large and highly successful phylum of intracellular parasites. Invasion of host cells allows apicomplexan parasites access to a rich source of nutrients in a niche that is largely protected from host defenses. All Apicomplexa adopt a common mode of host-cell entry, but individual species incorporate unique features and utilize a specific set of ligand-receptor interactions. These adhesins ultimately connect to a parasite actin-based motor, which provides the power for invasion. While some Apicomplexa can invade many different host cells, the disease-associated blood-stage form of the malaria parasite is restricted to erythrocytes.

</TITLE>

Cell. 2006 Feb 24;124(4):767-82.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Multicellular organisms possess very sophisticated defense mechanisms that are designed to effectively counter the continual microbial insult of the environment within the vertebrate host. However, successful microbial pathogens have in turn evolved complex and efficient methods to overcome innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, which can result in disease or chronic infections. Although the various virulence strategies used by viral and bacterial pathogens are numerous, there are several general mechanisms that are used to subvert and exploit immune systems that are shared between these diverse microbial pathogens. The success of each pathogen is directly dependant on its ability to mount an effective anti-immune response within the infected host, which can ultimately result in acute disease, chronic infection, or pathogen clearance. In this review, we highlight and compare some of the many molecular mechanisms that bacterial and viral pathogens use to evade host immune defenses.

<ABSTRACT>
Microorganisms that invade a vertebrate host are initially recognized by the innate immune system through germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). Several classes of PRRs, including Toll-like receptors and cytoplasmic receptors, recognize distinct microbial components and directly activate immune cells. Exposure of immune cells to the ligands of these receptors activates intracellular signaling cascades that rapidly induce the expression of a variety of overlapping and unique genes involved in the inflammatory and immune responses. New insights into innate immunity are changing the way we think about pathogenesis and the treatment of infectious diseases, allergy, and autoimmunity.

Host-microbe interactions: shaping the evolution of the plant immune
response.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Feb 24;124(4):803-14.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The evolution of the plant immune response has culminated in a highly effective defense system that is able to resist potential attack by microbial pathogens. The primary immune response is referred to as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) and has evolved to recognize common features of microbial pathogens. In the coevolution of host-microbe interactions, pathogens acquired the ability to deliver effector proteins to the plant cell to suppress PTI, allowing pathogen growth and disease. In response to the delivery of pathogen effector proteins, plants acquired surveillance proteins (R proteins) to either directly or indirectly monitor the presence of the pathogen effector proteins. In this review, taking an evolutionary perspective, we highlight important discoveries over the last decade about the plant immune response.

The evolution of adaptive immune systems.

Cell. 2006 Feb 24;124(4):815-22.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A clonally diverse anticipatory repertoire in which each lymphocyte bears a unique antigen receptor is the central feature of the adaptive immune system that evolved in our vertebrate ancestors. The survival advantage gained through adding this type of adaptive immune system to a pre-existing innate immune system led to the evolution of alternative ways for lymphocytes to generate diverse antigen receptors for use in recognizing and repelling pathogen invaders. All jawed vertebrates assemble their antigen-receptor genes through recombinatorial rearrangement of different immunoglobulin or T cell receptor gene segments. The surviving jawless vertebrates, lampreys and hagfish, instead solved the receptor diversification problem by the recombinatorial assembly of leucine-rich-repeat genetic modules to encode variable lymphocyte receptors. The convergent evolution of these remarkably different adaptive immune systems involved innovative genetic modification of innate-immune-system components.

Innate immunity gone awry: linking microbial infections to chronic
inflammation and cancer.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Feb 24;124(4):823-35.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Clinical and epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between infectious agents and chronic inflammatory disorders and cancer. Better understanding of microbial pattern-recognition receptors and innate immune signaling pathways of the host is helping to elucidate the connection between microbial infection and chronic disease. We propose that a key aspect of pathogenesis is an aberrant epithelial barrier that can be instigated by microbial toxins, environmental insults, or the genetic predisposition of the host. Loss of epithelial integrity results in activation of resident inflammatory cells by microbial invaders or endogenous ligands. When coupled with a failure of normal control mechanisms that limit leukocyte activation, a cascade is established that induces chronic inflammation and its consequences. Here, we outline this mechanistic framework and briefly review how alteration of innate immune response genes in murine models can provide insights into the potential microbial origins of diverse conditions including Crohn's disease, psoriasis, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and liver cancer.

Cell. 2006 Feb 24;124(4):849-63.

<ABSTRACT>
Vaccination is the most effective means of preventing infectious diseases. Despite the success of many vaccines, there is presently little knowledge of the immunological mechanisms that mediate their efficacy. Such information will be critical in the design of future vaccines against old and new infectious diseases. Recent advances in immunology are beginning to provide an intellectual framework with which to address fundamental questions about how the innate immune system shapes adaptive immunity. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about how the innate immune system modulates the quantity and quality of long-term T and B cell memory and protective immune responses to pathogens. In addition, we point out unanswered questions and identify critical challenges, the solution of which, we believe, will greatly facilitate the rational design of novel vaccines against a multitude of emerging infections.

Cell. 2006 Mar 24;124(6):1183-95. Epub 2006 Feb 23.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The interaction between ubiquitinated proteins and intracellular proteins harboring ubiquitin binding domains (UBDs) is critical to a multitude of cellular processes. Here, we report that Rabex-5, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5, binds to Ub through two independent UBDs. These UBDs determine a number of properties of Rabex-5, including its coupled monoubiquitination and interaction in vivo with ubiquitinated EGFRs. Structural and biochemical characterization of the UBDs of Rabex-5 revealed that one of them (MIU, motif interacting with ubiquitin) binds to Ub with modes superimposable to those of the UIM (ubiquitin-interacting motif):Ub interaction, although in the opposite orientation. The other UBD, RUZ (Rabex-5 ubiquitin binding zinc finger) binds to a surface of Ub centered on Asp58(Ub) and distinct from the "canonical" Ile44(Ub)-based surface. The two binding surfaces allow Ub to interact simultaneously with different UBDs, thus opening new perspectives in Ub-mediated signaling.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Although colorectal cancer is one of the best-characterized tumors with regard to the multistep progression, it remains one of the most frequent and deadly neoplasms. For a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the process of tumorigenesis and tumor progression, changes in protein expression between microdissected normal and tumorous colonic epithelium were analyzed. Cryostat sections from colorectal tumors, adenoma tissue, and adjacent normal mucosa were laser-microdissected and analyzed using ProteinChip Arrays. The derived MS profiles exhibited numerous statistical differences. One peak showing significantly high expression in the tumor was purified by reverse-phase chromatography and SDS-PAGE. The protein band of interest was passively eluted from the gel and identified as heat shock protein 10 (HSP 10) by tryptic digestion, peptide mapping, and MS/MS analysis. This tumor marker was further characterized by immunohistochemistry. Analysis of HSP 10-positive tissue by ProteinChip technology confirmed the identity of this protein. This work demonstrates that biomarker in colorectal cancer can be detected, identified, and assessed by a proteomic approach comprising tissue microdissection, protein profiling, and immunological techniques. In our experience, histological defined microdissected tissue areas should be used to identify proteins that might be responsible for tumorigenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
Feature extraction or biomarker selection is a critical step in disease diagnosis and knowledge discovery based on protein MS. Many studies have discussed the classification methods applied in proteomics; however, few could be found to address feature extraction in detail. In this paper, we developed a systematic approach for the extraction of mass spectrum peak apex and peak area with special emphasis on noise filtration and peak calibration. Application to a head and neck cancer data generated at the Eastern Virginia Medical School [Wadsworth, J. T., Somers, K. D., Cazares, L. H., Malik, G. et al.., Clin. Cancer Res. 2004, 10, 1625-1632] revealed that the new feature extraction method would yield consistent and highly discriminatory biomarkers.

Proteomic identification of alterations in metabolic enzymes and signaling

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Hypokalemic nephropathy caused by prolonged K(+) deficiency is associated with metabolic alkalosis, polydipsia, polyuria, growth retardation, hypertension, and progressive tubulointerstitial injury. Its pathophysiology, however, remains unclear. We performed gel-based, differential proteomics analysis of kidneys from BALB/c mice fed with high-normal-K(+) (HNK), low-normal-K(+) (LNK), or K(+)-depleted diet for 8 wk (n = 6 in each group). Plasma K(+) levels were 4.62 +/- 0.35, 4.46 +/- 0.23, and 1.51 +/- 0.21 mmol/L for HNK, LNK, and KD mice, respectively (p < 0.0001; KD vs. others). With comparable amounts of food intake, the KD mice drank significantly more water than the other two groups and had polyuria. Additionally, the KD mice had growth retardation, metabolic alkalosis, markedly enlarged kidneys, renal tubular dilation, intratubular deposition of amorphous and laminated hyaline materials, and tubular atrophy. A total of 33 renal proteins were differentially expressed between the KD mice and others, whereas only eight proteins were differentially expressed between the HNK and LNK groups, as determined by quantitative intensity analysis and ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc multiple comparisons. Using MALDI-MS and/or quadrupole-TOF MS/MS, 30 altered proteins induced by K(+)-depletion were identified as metabolic enzymes (e.g., carbonic anhydrase II, aldose reductase, glutathione S-transferase GT41A, etc.), signaling proteins (14-3-3 epsilon, 14-3-3 zeta, and cofilin 1), and cytoskeletal proteins (gamma-actin and tropomyosin). Some of these altered proteins, particularly metabolic enzymes and signaling proteins, have been demonstrated to be involved in metabolic alkalosis, polyuria, and renal tubular injury. Our findings may lead to a new road map for research on hypokalemic nephropathy and to better understanding of the pathophysiology of this medical disease when the functional and physiological significances of these altered proteins are defined.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2180-98.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
To get more insight into plant cell response to cadmium (Cd) stress, both proteomic and metabolomic "differential display" analyses were performed on Arabidopsis thaliana cells exposed to different concentrations of the toxic chemical. After a 24 h treatment, soluble proteins extracted from untreated and treated cells were separated by 2-D-PAGE and image analyses were performed to quantify and compare protein levels. Proteins up- and down-regulated in response to Cd were identified by MS and mapped into specific metabolic pathways and cellular processes, highlighting probable activation of the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolic pathways. For some of these proteins, Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses were performed to test transcript accumulation in response to Cd. In parallel, metabolite profiling analyses by LC coupled to ESI MS were initiated to better characterize the metabolic adaptation to the chemical stress. This study revealed that the main variation at the metabolite level came from the presence of six different families of phytochelatins, in A. thaliana cells treated with Cd, whose accumulation increases with Cd concentrations. Taken together these data provide an overview of the molecular and cellular changes elicited by Cd exposure.

Human colostrum is an important source of protective, nutritional and developmental factors for the newborn. We have investigated the low abundance proteins in the aqueous phase of human colostrum, after depletion of the major proteins secretory IgA, lactoferrin, alpha-lactalbumin and HSA by immunoabsorption, using 2-D LC and gel-based proteomic methods. One hundred and fifty-one proteins were identified, 83 of which have not been previously reported in human colostrum, or milk. This is the first comprehensive proteomic analysis of human colostrum produced during the first 48 h of lactation.

A proteomics-based approach is described that combines gel electrophoresis and MS in order to identify protein interactions and the nature of the interaction interface with high-sample throughput and sensitivity. Results for protein antigens of the influenza virus have demonstrated that the approach can be successfully employed to detect determinants within the hemagglutinin antigen of two divergent type A forms of the virus in present circulation. The determinants are localised to residues 206-224 following tryptic digestion of the hemagglutinin antigen. Specific peptide-antibody complexes formed after treatment of gel-recovered antigen are shown to be able to be preserved on the MALDI target array as has been previously demonstrated in this laboratory for whole virus. The approach has broad applicability for the analysis of a wide array of protein complexes with identification of the interaction interface in a single step with high-sample throughput and at low sample levels.

Proteomic analysis of the tegument and excretory-secretory products of
adult Schistosoma bovis worms.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S226-36.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Schistosoma bovis is a ruminant pathogen that is poorly known at a molecular level. With an aim of identifying the parasite proteins involved in host-parasite interplay, we studied two protein extracts that contain, respectively, the proteins excreted/secreted by the adult worm (ES) and the tegumental proteins exposed to the host (TG). The 2-DE, 2-D immunoblot and MS were employed to separate and identify the antigenic proteins and the most abundant non-antigenic proteins in each extract. There were some 400 and 600 spots detected in the ES and the TG extracts, respectively. Ninety-six spots were subjected to MS analysis and 64 of them were identified. Overall, we identified 18 S. bovis proteins located at the host-parasite interface, 16 of which have not been identified previously in this parasite, and one of which -lysozyme- has never been reported in a Schistosoma species. Of the proteins identified, at least 4 can counteract host defence mechanisms. The other proteins are also likely to play some role in the host-parasite relationships. Therefore, studies in grater depth on all these proteins will provide a better understanding of how this parasite interacts with its host and new strategies for anti-schistosome drug or vaccine design.

Identification of substrates of the extracellular protease ADAMTS1 by DIGE
proteomic analysis.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S28-35.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Proteolytic modification of components of the extracellular milieu by metalloproteinases plays important roles in the regulation of multiple cellular and physiological processes and pathological conditions. ADAMTS1 is a secreted enzyme of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family of proteases, which is related to angiogenesis and inflammation processes. Here, we describe a proteomic screening for putative ADAMTS1 substrates by analyzing the protein profiles obtained from cultures of transfected cells overexpressing the protease as compared to parental cells. Conditioned medium proteins of cultures of the two cell lines have been quantitatively compared by DIGE. Proteins showing differential levels have been identified by MS techniques leading to the finding of five potential new substrates of ADAMTS1: the basement membrane proteins nidogen-1 and -2, the desmosomal protein desmocollin-3, and the extracellular glycoproteins dystroglycan 1 and Mac-2-binding protein. Nidogen-1 and -2 have been further validated as substrates by immunochemical analysis. Our results demonstrate the utility of the DIGE proteomic technique for the discovery of specific substrates of matrix proteases.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S256-61.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Differential proteomic analysis has been performed on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of six healthy and six patients suffering form sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), age- and sex-matched, after immuno-subtraction of albumin and immunoglobulins. These maps have revealed 28 polypeptide chains differentially modulated in the sCJD samples, of which 10 appeared to be up-regulated, the remaining 18 being down-regulated. Among those, 13 could be identified upon digestion and MALDI-TOF, MS analysis. In addition, the strong modulation of cystatin C was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis and the highly altered level of the 14-3-3 proteins that escaped detection by 2-D mapping, could be assessed by Western blots and immuno-detection of monomeric and homo- and hetero-dimeric 14-3-3 isotypes. In search for a panel of potential markers for sCJD, we highlight cystatin C, 14-3-3 proteins, transferrin, ubiquitin, Apoliprotein J and perhaps some of the still unidentified, but strongly modulated polypeptide chains detected in the differential map.

<ABSTRACT>
Genomic and proteomic analyses generate a massive amount of data that requires specific bioinformatic tools for its management and interpretation. GARBAN II, developed from the previous GARBAN platform, provides an integrated framework to simultaneously analyse and compare multiple datasets from DNA microarrays and proteomic studies. The general architecture, gene classification and comparison, and graphical representation have been redesigned to ensure a user-friendly feature and to improve the capabilities and efficiency of this system. Additionally, GARBAN II has been extended with new applications to display networks of coexpressed genes and to integrate access to BioRag and MotifScanner so as to facilitate the holistic analysis of users' data.

level and protein identification.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S215-25.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In this paper, we present the protein map corresponding to the porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to better understand the role of these cells in the pig immune system. To conform the map, the proteins were separated by 2-DE using a 5-8 range pH gradient in IEF and approximately 800 spots were detected. Due to the high level of indeterminate variability associates to the 2-DE, analytical and biological variances were analyzed. The analytical variance was calculated for 50 proteins in three replicate 2-DE gels from the same protein extract whereas the biological variance was determined by comparison of the patterns obtained for the same 50 proteins in different animals. Values of 15.13 and 33.70% were determined for analytical and biological variances, respectively. These average variances will provide a quantified and statistical basis for future proteomic studies directed to evaluate relevant quantitative changes in the biological response. A representative set of the major proteins was subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis and over 75% of the proteins were identified on the basis of their similarity with its human homologue proteins. A large number of cytoskeletal and metabolic proteins were found as well as some proteins related to cell mobility and immunological functions. Finally, other proteins implicated in the cell signaling process, transport or apoptosis were also identified giving a wide overview of the porcine PBMC protein map.

Towards the identification of late-embryogenic-abundant phosphoproteome in

</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S175-85.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Late-embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) proteins accumulate as plant seeds desiccate and also in vegetative organs during periods of stress. They are predicted to play a role in plant stress tolerance. In the present study, we have initiated the characterization of phosphorylated LEA proteins present in the Arabidopsis seed, using a strategy that combines the thermostability (solubility upon heating) of many LEA-type proteins with the use of phosphoaffinity chromatography to obtain an enriched subpopulation of phosphoproteins. The specificity and efficiency of the procedure was assessed by alkaline phosphatase treatment and by a specific stain for phosphoproteins, in addition to the immunodetection of AtRab18, a phosphorylated LEA protein present in the mature dry seed. The phosphoproteins were identified by MS either by PMF using MALDI-TOF MS after 2-DE separation, or by peptide sequencing using both capillary LC MS/MS (LC muESI-ITMS/MS) and nanoLC coupled to nanoESI-MS/MS (LC-nanoESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS). Several LEA-type and storage-like proteins were identified as components of the phosphoproteome of the Arabidopsis seed.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
As a global approach to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in pea resistance to Erysiphe pisi, changes in the leaf proteome of two pea genotypes differing in their resistance phenotype were analyzed by a combination of 2-DE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Leaf proteins from control non-inoculated and inoculated susceptible (Messire) and resistant (JI2480) plants were resolved by 2-DE, with IEF in the 5-8 pH range and SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. CBB-stained gels revealed the existence of quantitative and qualitative differences between extracts from: (i) non-inoculated leaves of both genotypes (77 spots); (ii) inoculated and non-inoculated Messire leaves (19 spots); and (iii) inoculated and non-inoculated JI2480 leaves (12 spots). Some of the differential spots have been identified, after MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis and database searching, as proteins belonging to several functional categories, including photosynthesis and carbon metabolism, energy production, stress and defense, protein synthesis and degradation and signal transduction. Results are discussed in terms of constitutive and induced elements involved in pea resistance against Erysiphe pisi.

A mass spectrometric approach to identify arbuscular mycorrhiza-related
proteins in root plasma membrane fractions.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S145-55.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
One of the most important morphological changes occurring in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) roots takes place when the plant plasma membrane (PM) invaginates around the fungal arbuscular structures resulting in the periarbuscular membrane formation. To investigate whether AM symbiosis-specific proteins accumulate at this stage, two complementary MS approaches targeting the root PM from the model legume Medicago truncatula were designed. Membrane extracts were first enriched in PM using a discontinuous sucrose gradient method. The resulting PM fractions were further analysed with (i) an automated 2-D LC-MS/MS using a strong cation exchange and RP chromatography, and (ii) SDS-PAGE combined with a systematic LC-MS/MS analysis. Seventy-eight proteins, including hydrophobic ones, were reproducibly identified in the PM fraction from non-inoculated roots, representing the first survey of the M. truncatula root PM proteome. Comparison between non-inoculated and Glomus intraradices-inoculated roots revealed two proteins that differed in the mycorrhizal root PM fraction. They corresponded to an H(+)-ATPase (Mtha1) and a predicted glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored blue copper-binding protein (MtBcp1), both potentially located on the periarbuscular membrane. The exact role of MtBcp1 in AM symbiosis remains to be investigated.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Exposure to oil mist has been associated with a variety of acute and chronic respiratory effects. Using proteomics approaches to investigate exposure-associated proteins may provide useful information to understand the mechanisms of associated respiratory effects. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in rat bronchoalveolar lavage fluid proteins associated with oil mist exposure using nano-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The results revealed that 29 proteins exhibited significant changes after exposure. These proteins included surfactant-associated proteins (SP-A and SP-D), inflammatory proteins (complement component 3, immunoglobulins, lysozyme, etc.), growth factors (e.g., transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha)), calcium-binding proteins (calcyclin, calgranulin A, calreticulin, and calvasculin), and other proteins (e.g., cathepsin D, saposin, and intestinal trefoil factor). To further evaluate changes in protein levels, a simple quantitative strategy was developed in this study. A large decrease in protein levels of SP-A and SP-D (0.24- and 0.38-fold, respectively) following exposure was observed. In contrast, protein levels of TGF-alpha and calcium-binding proteins were significantly increased (4.46- and 1.4-1.8-fold, respectively). Due to the diverse functions of these proteins, the results might contribute to understand the mechanisms involved in lung disorders induced by oil mist exposure.

Functional proteomics of resveratrol-induced colon cancer cell apoptosis:
caspase-6-mediated cleavage of lamin A is a major signaling loop.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2386-94.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The study investigated the molecular basis of resveratrol (RSV)-evoked apoptosis in four (Bax+/-, Bax-/-, p53+/+, and p53-/-) HCT116 colon cancer cell lines. RSV induced apoptosis in all the cells in a dose-dependent manner; however, Bax+/- and p53+/+ cells were more susceptible than their knockout counterparts (Bax-/- and p53-/-, respectively). Using Bax+/- cells as a model, proteomic analysis revealed four RSV-responsive events: fragmentation of lamin A/C protein; increase in concentration of a more basic isoelectric variant of the ribosomal protein P0; and decrease in concentration of dUTPase as well as stathmin 1. Lamin A cleavage in response to RSV treatment was confirmed using Western blot analysis. Caspase-6 was activated, which was evidenced by cleavage and accumulation in active form of caspase-6 as well as upregulation of the protease activity. RSV-elicited lamin A cleavage and apoptosis were entirely abrogated by the peptide inhibitors of caspase-6. Likewise, partial knockdown of caspase-6 expression using small interfering RNA resulted in significant inhibition of RSV-elicited lamin A cleavage and apoptosis. Furthermore, the lower apoptosis sensitivity of the knockout cells (Bax-/- and p53-/-) correlated with the relatively reduced processing of caspase-6 and lamin A cleavage. Taken together, these data highlight the critical role of caspase-6 and its cleavage of lamin A in apoptotic signaling triggered by RSV in the colon carcinoma cells, which can be activated in the absence of Bax or p53.

An evaluation of in vitro protein-protein interaction techniques:
assessing contaminating background proteins.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2050-69.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Determination of protein-protein interactions is an important component in assigning function and discerning the biological relevance of proteins within a broader cellular context. In vitro protein-protein interaction methodologies, including affinity chromatography, coimmunoprecipitation, and newer approaches such as protein chip arrays, hold much promise in the detection of protein interactions, particularly in well-characterized organisms with sequenced genomes. However, each of these approaches attracts certain background proteins that can thwart detection and identification of true interactors. In addition, recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli are also extensively used to assess protein-protein interactions, and background proteins in these isolates can thus contaminate interaction studies. Rigorous validation of a true interaction thus requires not only that an interaction be found by alternate techniques, but more importantly that researchers be aware of and control for matrix/support dependence. Here, we evaluate these methods for proteins interacting with DmsD (an E. coli redox enzyme maturation protein chaperone), in vitro, using E. coli subcellular fractions as prey sources. We compare and contrast the various in vitro interaction methods to identify some of the background proteins and protein profiles that are inherent to each of the methods in an E. coli system.

Surface enhanced laser desorption ionization spectrometry reveals
biomarkers for drug treatment but not dose.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2101-7.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Here we describe the use of SELDI-MS to detect dose-dependent peptide changes in plasma from mice treated with vehicle or rosiglitazone at one of two doses (10 and 30 mg/kg). SELDI features differentiating spectra from the three conditions were found and used to train classifiers. Samples treated with vehicle could be reliably distinguished from samples treated with either dose, but samples treated with the different doses could not be reliably distinguished from one another. We conclude that while SELDI-TOF mass spectra can be used to distinguish treated from untreated samples, the reproducibility and information content of SELDI-TOF are currently not sufficient as a pharmacodynamic readout to distinguish between mice treated with 10 or 30 mg/kg of rosiglitazone. This raises more general questions about whether SELDI's sensitivity is sufficient for detecting dose-dependent changes in plasma.

Comparative proteomic analysis reveals a function of the novel death
receptor-associated protein BRE in the regulation of prohibitin and p53
expression and proliferation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2376-85.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The brain and reproductive organ expressed (BRE) gene encodes a highly conserved stress-modulating protein. To gain further insight into the function of this gene, we used comparative proteomics to investigate the protein profiles of C2C12 and D122 cells resulting from small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing as well as overexpression of BRE. Silencing of BRE in C2C12 cells, using siRNA, resulted in up-regulated Akt-3 and carbonic anhydrase III expression, while the 26S proteasome regulatory subunit S14 and prohibitin were down-regulated. Prohibitin is a potential tumour suppressor gene, which can directly interact with p53. We found that cell proliferation was significantly increased after knockdown of BRE, concomitant with reduced p53 and prohibitin expression. In contrast, we observed decreased proliferation and up-regulation of p53 and prohibitin when BRE was overexpressed in the D122 cell line. In total, five proteins were found to be up-regulated after BRE over-expression. The majority of these proteins can target or crosstalk with NF-kappaB, which plays a central role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Our results establish a crucial role for BRE in the regulation of key proteins of the cellular stress-response machinery and provide an explanation for the multifunctional nature of BRE.

<ABSTRACT>
We are interested in learning more about the proteome of Uromyces appendiculatus, the fungus that causes common bean rust. Knowledge of the proteins that differentiate life-cycle stages and distinguish infectious bodies such as uredospores, germlings, appressoria, and haustoria may be used to define host-pathogen interactions or serve as targets for chemical inhibition of the fungus. We have used 2-D nanoflowLC-MS/MS to identify more than 400 proteins from asexual uredospores. A majority of the proteins appear to have roles in protein folding or protein catabolism. We present a model by which an abundance of heat shock proteins and translation elongation factors may enhance a spore's ability to survive environmental stresses and rapidly initiate protein production upon germination.

Proteomic analysis of nasal cells from cystic fibrosis patients and
non-cystic fibrosis control individuals: Search for novel biomarkers of
cystic fibrosis lung disease.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2314-25.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Potential biological markers for cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease were identified by comparative proteomics profiling of nasal cells from deletion of phenylalanine residue 508 (F508del)-homozygous CF patients and non-CF controls. From the non-CF 2-DE gels, 65 spots were identified by MS, and a reference 2-DE map was thus established. The majority of those correspond to ubiquitously expressed proteins. Consistent with the epithelial origin of this tissue, some of the identified proteins are epithelial markers (e.g. cytokeratins, palate lung and nasal epithelium clone protein (PLUNC), and squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1). Comparison of this protein profile with the one similarly obtained for CF nasal cells revealed a set of differentially expressed proteins. These included proteins related to chronic inflammation and some others involved in oxidative stress injury. Alterations were also observed in the levels of cytoskeleton proteins, being probably implicated with cytoskeleton organization changes described to occur in CF-airways. Lower levels were found for some mitochondrial proteins suggesting an altered mitochondrial metabolism in CF. Differential expression was also found for two more enzymes that have not been previously associated to CF. Further studies will clarify the involvement of such proteins in CF pathophysiology and whether they are targets for CF therapy.

Improving the reliability and throughput of mass spectrometry-based
proteomics by spectrum quality filtering.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2086-94.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In contemporary peptide-centric or non-gel proteome studies, vast amounts of peptide fragmentation data are generated of which only a small part leads to peptide or protein identification. This motivates the development and use of a filtering algorithm that removes spectra that contribute little to protein identification. Removal of unidentifiable spectra reduced both the amount of computational and human time spent on analyzing spectra as well as the chances of obtaining false identifications. Thorough testing on various proteome datasets from different instruments showed that the best suggested machine-learning classifier is, on average, able to recognize half of the unidentified spectra as bad spectra. Further analyses showed that several unidentified spectra classified as good were derived from peptides carrying unanticipated amino acid modifications or contained sequence tags that allowed peptide identification using homology searches. The implementation of the classifiers is available under the GNU General Public License at http://www.bioinfo.no/software/spectrumquality.

Proteomic analysis of quorum sensing in Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S97-S106.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Production of quorum-sensing signal molecules of the acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) type by Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae UPM791 is dependent on its plasmid content. Curing of two of its four native plasmids, pUPM791d and pSym, resulted in loss of production of the largest (C(14)) and the three smaller (C(6)-C(8)) AHLs, respectively. Introduction of a lactonase-containing plasmid resulted in AHL signal degradation and quorum quenching. The quorum-dependent proteome was studied in these strains by DIGE. Quorum quenching affected a small (1.7%) fraction of the detected spots in the wild-type and a smaller (0.6%) fraction in the pSym-cured strain. Unexpectedly, quorum quenching affected up to 3.3% of the detected spots in the pUPM791d-cured strain, suggesting that C(14)-AHL normally interferes with the quorum response mediated by other AHLs. This, together with the observation that ca. 50% of the quorum-regulated proteins in strain UPM791 showed AHL-mediated repression, suggests that an important part of their functionality can be exerted through repression, although AHLs are usually considered as gene expression inducers. The three main quorum-induced polypeptides were identified by MALDI-MS as charge isoforms of the rhizospheric RhiA protein. Another major quorum-induced polypeptide was only present in the pUPM791d-cured strain and could not be identified.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The main goal of this study was to analyze, using proteomic techniques, changes in protein expression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells that could give insights into a better early prognosis for tumor pathophysiology. Proteomic analysis of different subtypes of AML cells was carried out using 2-DE and MALDI-TOF PMF analysis. Proteins identified as more significantly altered between the different AMLs belonged to the group of suppressor genes, metabolic enzymes, antioxidants, structural proteins and signal transduction mediators. Among them, seven identified proteins were found significantly altered in almost all the AML blast cells analyzed in relation to normal mononuclear blood cells: alpha-enolase, RhoGDI2, annexin A10, catalase, peroxiredoxin 2, tromomyosin 3, and lipocortin 1 (annexin 1). These differentially expressed proteins are known to play important roles in cellular functions such as glycolysis, tumor suppression, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis, and they might contribute to the adverse evolution of the disease. Proteomic analysis has identified for the first time novel proteins that may either help to form a differential prognosis or be used as markers for disease outcome, thus providing potential new targets for rational pathogenesis-based therapies of AML.

<ABSTRACT>
Postembryonically formed shoot-borne roots make up the major backbone of the adult maize root stock. In this study the abundant soluble proteins of the first node (coleoptilar node) of wild-type and mutant rtcs seedlings, which do not initiate crown roots, were compared at two early stages of crown root formation. In Coomassie Bluestained 2-D gels, representing soluble proteins of coleoptilar nodes 5 and 10 days after germination, 146 and 203 proteins were detected, respectively. Five differentially accumulated proteins (> two-fold change; t-test: 95% significance) were identified in 5-day-old and 14 differentially accumulated proteins in 10-day-old coleoptilar nodes of wild-type versus rtcs. All 19 differentially accumulated proteins were identified via ESI MS/MS mass spectrometry. Five differentially accumulated proteins, including a regulatory G-protein and a putative auxin-binding protein, were further analyzed at the RNA expression level. These experiments confirmed differential gene expression and revealed subtle developmental regulation of these genes during early coleoptilar node development. This study represents the first proteomic analysis of shoot-borne root initiation in cereals and will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis of this developmental process unique to cereals.

The 2-nitrobenzenesulfenyl (NBS) method, which is useful for quantitative proteome analysis, is based on stable isotope labeling of tryptophan residues with NBS chloride ((12)C(6)-NBSCl or (13)C(6)-NBSCl). We found that 3-hydroxy-4-nitrobenzoic acid (3H4NBA) is a more suitable matrix than 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) for detecting NBS-labeled peptides by MALDI-quadrupole IT (QIT)-TOF MS . Furthermore, NBS-labeled peptides were selectively ionized and detected in a mixture of NBS-labeled and unlabeled peptides. Labeled paired peaks were easily detected without enrichment, nonpaired labeled peaks were clearly distinguished from unlabeled contaminating peptides, and nitrotyrosine-containing peptides were also selectively detected on the 3H4NBA matrix, while by-product-peaks arising from nitrobenzene moieties were suppressed. The use of 3H4NBA as a comatrix with CHCA improved the sensitivity of detection while substantially retaining the selectivity of 3H4NBA. The 3H4NBA matrix offers great advantages in terms of simplicity, sensitivity, and usability when used for the NBS method and for MALDI-TOF MS analysis applied to compounds having a nitrobenzene ring.

<ABSTRACT>
The Human Liver Proteome Project (HLPP) is the first initiative of the Human Proteome Organisation (HUPO) to target a human organ/tissue and aims at the establishment of a biological atlas of the liver to advance our understanding of liver functions and to provide the tools to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics for liver diseases. The major achievements of HLPP during its pilot phase (2003-2005) were presented during a one-day workshop held on August 27, 2005, immediately prior to the 4th HUPO World Congress in Munich, Germany. These include (i) the participation of a large number of laboratories worldwide and the initiation of international research collaborations; (ii) the establishment of a management infrastructure and (iii) the development of standard operating procedures and the generation and collection of a first set of expression profile data. A summary of the workshop was subsequently presented by Professor Fuchu He, the Chair of this initiative, during the HUPO 4th Annual World Congress.

Proteome analysis of sorbitol fermentation specific protein in Vibrio
cholerae by 2-DE and MS.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1848-55.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Vibrio cholerae can be differentiated into epidemic and non-epidemic strains by sorbitol fermentation speed, but little research has been done on its mechanisms. In this study, we investigated differential protein expression of the two strains in response to sorbitol metabolism. V. cholerae strains were cultured in media with and without sorbitol, respectively. Proteins were separated by 2-DE, and those that showed different expression in the two media were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Fifteen proteins in epidemic strains and 11 proteins in non-epidemic strains showed a different expression in sorbitol medium. Among them, 4 proteins were common to epidemic and non-epidemic strains. Gene sequence analysis showed that some mutations occurred in these proteins between the two strains. Potential functions of these proteins included sugar uptake, amino acid uptake, electron transport, sulfate and thiosulfate transport.

Proteome analysis of multidrug resistance in vincristine-resistant human

Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):2009-21.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In order to elucidate the mechanisms of multidrug resistance (MDR) of vincristine-resistant human gastric carcinoma cell line SGC7901/VCR, 2-DE was used to separate the total proteins of SGC7901/VCR and its parental cell line SGC7901. PDQuest software was applied to analyze 2-DE images, and the differential protein spots were identified by both MALDI-TOF-MS and ESI-Q-TOF-MS. Then the differential expressional levels of partially identified proteins were determined by Western blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, the association of heat shock protein (HSP27), one of the highly expressed proteins in sgc7901/vcr, with MDR was analyzed using antisense inhibition of HSP27. In this study, the well-resolved, reproducible 2-DE patterns of SGC7901/VCR and SGC7901 were established, and yielded about 1100 protein-spots each. All the 24 differential proteins between the two cell lines were identified, and the differential expression levels of the partial proteins were confirmed. The suppression of HSP27 expression by HSP27 antisense oligonucleotides could enhance vincristine chemosensitivity in sgc7901/vcr and induce the cells to exhibit apoptotic morphological features after vincristine treatment. The differentially expressed proteins could be divided into six groups based on their functions: calcium-binding proteins, chaperones, proteins involved in drug detoxification or repair of DNA damage, metabolic enzymes, proteins related to cellular structure, and proteins relative to signal transduction, some of which may contribute to MDR of human gastric carcinoma cell line SGC7901/VCR. These data will be valuable for further study of the mechanisms of MDR in human gastric cancer.

Ligand profiling and identification technology for searching bioactive
ligands.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(6):1741-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We introduce a new methodology named ligand profiling and identification for effective discovery of bioactive ligands such as peptide hormones. This technology was developed from a new concept of parallel column chromatography and active fraction profiling by nano-LC MS. Traditional methods use sequential column chromatography, and thus are inevitably limited by the low abundance of the peptide of interest and by a low yield due to the many column steps. Using this new technology, insulin was successfully identified and diarginylinsulin, a minor intermediate form of insulin, was unexpectedly also identified simultaneously from 100 mg of porcine pancreatic tissue. This integrative technology could be used to search for various low-abundance peptides (or bioactive molecules) rapidly and simultaneously, by applying this to the later stages of traditional sequential purification.

Differentially isotope-coded N-terminal protein sulphonation: combining
protein identification and quantification.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2338-49.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Most proteomic labelling technologies intend to improve protein quantification and/or facilitate (de novo) peptide sequencing. We present here a novel stable-isotope labelling method to simultaneously identify and quantify protein components in complex mixtures by specifically derivatizing the N-terminus of proteins with 4-sulphophenyl isothiocyanate (SPITC). Our approach combines protein identification with quantification through differential isotope-coded labelling at the protein N-terminus prior to digestion. The isotope spacing of 6 Da (unlabelled vs. six-fold 13C-labelled tag) between derivatized peptide pairs enables the detection on different MS platforms (MALDI and ESI). Optimisation of the reaction conditions using SPITC was performed on three model proteins. Improved detection of the N-terminally derivatized peptide compared to the native analogue was observed in negative-ion MALDI-MS. Simpler fragmentation patterns compared to native peptides facilitated protein identification. The 13C-labelled SPITC resulted in convenient peptide pair spacing without isotopic overlap and hence facilitated relative quantification by MALDI-TOF/TOF and LC-ESI-MS/MS. The combination of facilitated identification and quantification achieved by differentially isotope-coded N-terminal protein tagging with light/heavy SPITC represents, to our knowledge, a new approach to quantitative proteomics.

Oxidation-reduction respiratory chains and ATP synthase complex are
localized in detergent-resistant lipid rafts.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2444-53.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In order to detect and identify ubiquitous lipid raft marker proteins, we isolated lipid rafts from different mouse organs, including the liver, lung, large brain, and kidney, and analyzed their proteins via 2-DE. Many protein spots were determined to be ubiquitous in all of the lipid rafts, and were annotated via LC and MS/MS. Twelve proteins were identified as ubiquitous raft proteins, and most of these were determined to be mitochondrial proteins, including mortalin, prohibitin, voltage-dependent anion channel, ATP synthase, NADH dehydrogenase, and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. Via immunoblotting, these proteins were shown to exist in detergent-resistant lipid rafts prepared using different organ tissues. Since these oxidation-reduction respiratory chains and ATP synthase complex were detected in detergent-resistant lipid raft fractions which had been isolated from the plasma membrane but not from the mitochondria, and found in the cell surface when determined by immunofluoresence and immunohistochemistry, we conclude that plasma membrane lipid rafts might contain oxidation-reduction respiratory chains and ATP synthase complex.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In this report we present a catalogue of 162 proteins (including isoforms and variants) identified in a prototype of proteomic map of breast cancer cells. This work represents the prosecution of previous studies describing the protein complement of breast cancer cells of the line 8701-BC, which has been well characterized for several parameters, providing to be a useful model for the study of breast cancer-associated candidate biomarkers. In particular, 110 spots were identified ex novo by PMF, or validated following previous gel matching identification method; 30 were identified by N-terminal microsequencing and the remaining by gel matching with maps available from our former work. As a consequence of the expanded number of proteins, we have updated our previous classification extending the number of protein groups from 4 to 13. In order to facilitate comparative proteome studies of different kinds of breast cancers, in this report we provide the whole complement of proteins so far identified and grouped into the new classification. A consistent number of them were not described before in other proteomic maps of breast cancer cells or tissues, and therefore they represent a valuable contribution for breast cancer protein databases and for future application in basic and clinical researches.

An important role of a "probable ATP-binding component of ABC transporter"
during the process of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance to
fluoroquinolone.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2495-503.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In order to find new drug target to eliminate the fluoroquinolone resistance, the in vitro progress of Pseudomonas aeruginosa fluoroquinolone resistance was mimicked, and then proteomic analysis was applied to comparing different protein profiles during the resistant process. The results show that the expression of a "probable ATP-binding component of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter" existed in ciprofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains, but not in sensitive strain. In addition, the ciprofloxacin concentrations in P. aeruginosa strains, which were obtained from the progress of P. aeruginosa fluoroquinolone resistance, were determined by means of HPLC; the results show that the decrease of the intracellular concentration of drug and the expression of this new protein nearly take place simultaneously. The changes of mRNA levels of the probable ATP-binding component of ABC transporter were detected by virtue of RT-PCR and showed that this protein did not express in the sensitive strains but expressed increasingly in the intermediate and resistant strains. In order to determine the relationships between the development of antibiotic resistance and this protein further, a DNAzyme was designed to aim at the mRNA of the probable ATP-binding component of ABC transporter directly; the ciprofloxacin resistance of P. aeruginosa was partially reduced in vivo by inhibiting the expression of this protein. This DNAzyme has no effect on sensitive strain. And the comparison of drug intracellular concentrations between DNAzyme-treated strains and its control strains shows that this protein may be included in the course of active drug efflux.

Selecting thioredoxins for disulphide proteomics: Target proteomes of
three thioredoxins from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.

<ABSTRACT>
Searching for enzymes and other proteins which can be redox-regulated by dithiol/disulphide exchange is a rapidly expanding area of functional proteomics. Recently, several experimental approaches using thioredoxins have been developed for this purpose. Thioredoxins comprise a large family of redox-active enzymes capable of reducing protein disulphides to cysteines and of participating in a variety of processes, such as enzyme modulation, donation of reducing equivalents and signal transduction. In this study we screened the target proteomes of three different thioredoxins from the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, using site-directed active-site cysteine-to-serine mutants of its m-, x- and y-type thioredoxins. The properties of a thioredoxin that determine the outcome of such analyses were found to be target-binding capacity, solubility and the presence of non-active-site cysteines. Thus, we explored how the choice of thioredoxin affects the target proteomes and we conclude that the m-type thioredoxin, TrxA, is by far the most useful for screening of disulphide proteomes. Furthermore, we improved the resolution of target proteins on non-reducing/reducing 2-DE, leading to the identification of 14 new potentially redox-regulated proteins in this organism. The presence of glycogen phosphorylase among the newly identified targets suggests that glycogen breakdown is redox-regulated in addition to glycogen synthesis.

<ABSTRACT>
The polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbon 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is an ubiquitously distributed environmental pollutant which can induce a broad spectrum of toxic responses in animals, including birds. In this study, we investigated the impact of 0 or 20 ng TCDD injections into the yolk of chicken eggs before start of development, on liver and ovarian protein expression in hatchlings using fluorescent two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D-DIGE) under a pH range of 4-7, combined with MS. Despite considerable interindividual variability, exposure to TCDD prior to the start of embryonic development resulted in significant changes in expression of a small set of proteins. Expression of fibrinogen gamma chain precursor in the liver and 60 kDa heat shock protein in the ovary were significantly higher as a result of the very early exposure to TCDD. NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase (42 kDa subunit) and regucalcin expression was decreased by early TCDD treatment in the liver and ovary, respectively. These proteins could not be directly linked with drug metabolism per se but are involved in blood clotting, oxidative stress, electron transport, and calcium regulation. It remains to be elucidated how these changes in the hatchling might be linked to the observed long-term consequences during posthatch life of the chicken.

Tat protein expression.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S63-73.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The effects of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein on cellular gene expression were analysed using a Jurkat cell line that was stably transfected with tat gene in a doxycycline-repressible expression system. Expressed Tat protein (aa 1-101) was proved to present basically a nuclear localisation, and to be fully functional to induce HIV LTR transactivation. Tat expression also resulted in protection from Tunicamycin-induced apoptosis as determined by DNA staining and TUNEL assays. We applied proteomics methods to investigate changes in differential protein expression in the transfected Jurkat-Tat cells. Protein identification was performed using 2-D DIGE followed by MS analysis. We identified the down-regulation of several cytoskeletal proteins such as actin, beta-tubulin, annexin II, as well as gelsolin, cofilin and the Rac/Rho-GDI complex. Down-expression of these proteins could be involved in the survival of long-term reservoirs of HIV-infected CD(4) (+) T cells responsible for continuous viral production. In conclusion, in addition to its role in viral mRNA elongation, the proteomic approach has provided insight into the way that Tat modifies host cell gene expression.

<ABSTRACT>
In response to environmental and dietary cues, the C. elegans orphan nuclear receptor, DAF-12, regulates dauer diapause, reproductive development, fat metabolism, and life span. Despite strong evidence for hormonal control, the identification of the DAF-12 ligand has remained elusive. In this work, we identified two distinct 3-keto-cholestenoic acid metabolites of DAF-9, a cytochrome P450 involved in hormone production, that function as ligands for DAF-12. At nanomolar concentrations, these steroidal ligands (called dafachronic acids) bind and transactivate DAF-12 and rescue the hormone deficiency of daf-9 mutants. Interestingly, DAF-9 has a biochemical activity similar to mammalian CYP27A1 catalyzing addition of a terminal acid to the side chain of sterol metabolites. Together, these results define the first steroid hormones in nematodes as ligands for an invertebrate orphan nuclear receptor and demonstrate that steroidal regulation of reproduction, from biology to molecular mechanism, is conserved from worms to humans.

In this way, endocytosis and cell signaling are intertwined in many biological processes, such as cell motility and cell fate determination.

<ABSTRACT>
Sex chromosomes--particularly the human Y--have been a source of fascination for decades because of their unique transmission patterns and their peculiar cytology. The outpouring of genomic data confirms that their atypical structure and gene composition break the rules of genome organization, function, and evolution. The X has been shaped by dosage differences to have a biased gene content and to be subject to inactivation in females. The Y chromosome seems to be a product of a perverse evolutionary process that does not select the fittest Y, which may cause its degradation and ultimate extinction.

RNAi components are required for nuclear clustering of Polycomb group
response elements.

Cell. 2006 Mar 10;124(5):957-71.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Drosophila Polycomb group (PcG) proteins silence homeotic genes through binding to Polycomb group response elements (PREs). Fab-7 is a PRE-containing regulatory element from the homeotic gene Abdominal-B. When present in multiple copies in the genome, Fab-7 can induce long-distance gene contacts that enhance PcG-dependent silencing. We show here that components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery are involved in PcG-mediated silencing at Fab-7 and in the production of small RNAs at transgenic Fab-7 copies. In general, these mutations do not affect the recruitment of PcG components, but they are specifically required for the maintenance of long-range contacts between Fab-7 copies. Dicer-2, PIWI, and Argonaute1, three RNAi components, frequently colocalize with PcG bodies, and their mutation significantly reduces the frequency of PcG-dependent chromosomal associations of endogenous homeotic genes. This suggests a novel role for the RNAi machinery in regulating the nuclear organization of PcG chromatin targets.

Crystal structure of the CSL-Notch-Mastermind ternary complex bound to

<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Mar 10;124(5):985-96.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Notch signaling mediates communication between cells and is essential for proper embryonic patterning and development. CSL is a DNA binding transcription factor that regulates transcription of Notch target genes by interacting with coregulators. Transcriptional activation requires the displacement of corepressors from CSL by the intracellular portion of the receptor Notch (NotchIC) and the recruitment of the coactivator protein Mastermind to the complex. Here we report the 3.1 A structure of the ternary complex formed by CSL, NotchIC, and Mastermind bound to DNA. As expected, the RAM domain of Notch interacts with the beta trefoil domain of CSL; however, the C-terminal domain of CSL has an unanticipated central role in the interface formed with the Notch ankyrin repeats and Mastermind. Ternary complex formation induces a substantial conformational change within CSL, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the conversion of CSL from a repressor to an activator.

Ligands for clathrin-mediated endocytosis are differentially sorted into
distinct populations of early endosomes.
</TITLE>

Cell. 2006 Mar 10;124(5):997-1009.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cells rely on the correct sorting of endocytic ligands and receptors for proper function. Early endosomes have been considered as the initial sorting station where cargos for degradation separate from those for recycling. Using live-cell imaging to monitor individual endosomes and ligand particles in real time, we have discovered a sorting mechanism that takes place prior to early endosome entry. We show that early endosomes are in fact comprised of two distinct populations: a dynamic population that is highly mobile on microtubules and matures rapidly toward late endosomes and a static population that matures much more slowly. Several cargos destined for degradation are preferentially targeted to the dynamic endosomes, whereas the recycling ligand transferrin is nonselectively delivered to all early endosomes and effectively enriched in the larger, static population. This pre-early endosome sorting process begins at clathrin-coated vesicles, depends on microtubule-dependent motility, and appears to involve endocytic adaptors.

A landmark protein essential for establishing and perpetuating the
polarity of a bacterial cell.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Mar 10;124(5):1011-23.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Polarity is often an intrinsic property of the cell, yet little is known about its origin or its maintenance over generations. Here we identify a landmark protein, TipN, which acts as a spatial and temporal cue for setting up the correct polarity in the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. TipN marks the new pole throughout most of the cell cycle, and its relocation to the nascent poles at the end of division provides a preexisting reference point for orienting the polarity axis in the progeny. Deletion of tipN causes pleiotropic polarity defects, including frequently reversed asymmetry in progeny size and mislocalization of proteins and organelles. Ectopic localization of TipN along the lateral side of the cell creates new axes of polarity leading to cell branching and formation of competent cell poles. Localization defects of the actin-like protein MreB in the DeltatipN mutant suggest that TipN is upstream of MreB in regulating cell polarity.

Bacterial birth scar proteins mark future flagellum assembly site.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Mar 10;124(5):1025-37.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Many prokaryotic protein complexes underlie polar asymmetry. In Caulobacter crescentus, a flagellum is built exclusively at the pole that arose from the previous cell division. The basis for this pole specificity is unclear but could involve a cytokinetic birth scar that marks the newborn pole as the flagellum assembly site. We identified two developmental proteins, TipN and TipF, which localize to the division septum and the newborn pole after division. We show that septal localization of TipN/F depends on cytokinesis. Moreover, TipF, a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase homolog, is a flagellum assembly factor that relies on TipN for proper positioning. In the absence of TipN, flagella are assembled at ectopic locations, and TipF is mislocalized to such sites. Thus TipN and TipF establish a link between bacterial cytokinesis and polar asymmetry, demonstrating that division does indeed leave a positional mark in its wake to direct the biogenesis of a polar organelle.

SMK-1, an essential regulator of DAF-16-mediated longevity.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Mar 10;124(5):1039-53.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) regulates aging in worms, flies, and mice through a well-characterized, highly conserved core set of components. IIS also regulates early developmental decisions, the reproductive status of the animal, innate immunity, and stress-resistance functions. In C. elegans, the sole insulin/IGF-1 receptor, DAF-2, negatively regulates the FOXO transcription factor, DAF-16. We report here on a new component of the IIS longevity pathway, SMK-1, which specifically influences DAF-16-dependent regulation of the aging process in C. elegans by regulating the transcriptional specificity of DAF-16 activity. Localization analysis of DAF-16 places SMK-1 downstream of DAF-16's phosphorylation-dependent relocation to the nucleus. Physiological and transcription analyses indicate that smk-1 is required for the innate immune, UV, and oxidative stress but not the thermal stress functions of DAF-16. SMK-1 therefore plays a role in longevity by modulating DAF-16 transcriptional specificity without affecting other processes regulated by IIS.

Germ-cell loss extends C. elegans life span through regulation of DAF-16
by kri-1 and lipophilic-hormone signaling.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Mar 10;124(5):1055-68.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In C. elegans, removing the germ cells extends life span by triggering the nuclear localization and activation of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor in the intestine. In this study, we identify and analyze genes required for germline removal to extend life span. We find that the reproductive system communicates with the intestine through lipophilic-hormone signaling and that a gene called kri-1 is likely to act in the intestine to promote DAF-16 nuclear localization in response to this signal. This lipophilic-signaling pathway and kri-1 are not required for DAF-16's nuclear localization and life-span extension in animals with decreased insulin/IGF-1 signaling. Thus, this pathway specifically enables the integration of cues from the reproductive system with central DAF-16-activation pathways to influence the aging of the animal.

Proteomic analysis of tobacco mosaic virus-infected tomato (Lycopersicon

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S196-206.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is a widespread plant virus from the genus Tobamovirus that affects tobacco and tomato plants causing a pathology characterised by cell breakage and disorganisation in plant leaves and fruits. In this study we undertook a proteomic approach to investigate the molecular and biochemical mechanisms potentially involved in tomato fruit defence against the viral infection. The comparison of 2-D gels from control and TMV-infected but asymptomatic tomato fruits revealed changes in several proteins. The differential expression of peptidases, endoglucanase, chitinase and proteins participating in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle in infected fruits suggests that pathogenesis-related proteins and antioxidant enzymes may play a role in the protection against TMV infection. TMV coat protein appeared as a prominent spot in 2-D gels from TMV-infected asymptomatic fruits. A Triton X-114 phase-partitioning step of tomato protein extracts favoured the solubilisation of TMV coat protein and the enrichment of two aminopeptidases not present in control fruits. PMF and MS/MS data of the 2-D gel-isolated TMV coat protein is proposed as a powerful analysis method for the simultaneous tobamovirus detection, species determination and strain differentiation in virus-infected fruit commodities.

Proteomic analysis of p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S262-71.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Oncogenic Ras signaling has been long known to play an important role in tumorigenesis and human cancer. In this report, we have used the sensitive 2-D-DIGE coupled to MS for the identification of proteins differentially expressed at the cell membrane level between oncogenic H-RasV12-transformed wild-type and p38alpha-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Following trifluoroethanol solubilization, 76 proteins were found to be differentially regulated. After PMF, 63 spots containing 42 different proteins were unequivocally identified by MALDI-TOF MS coupled with database interrogation. As expected, many of them were membrane proteins. Six proteins were selected for further validation studies based on their potential functional link with malignant transformation and signal transduction. These were prohibitin (PHB), protein disulfide isomerase 3 (PDIA3), focal adhesion kinase 2 (FAK2), c-GMP dependent protein kinase 2 (KGP2), NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 30 kDa subunit (NUGM) and translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP). All these proteins were up-regulated in the membranes of H-RasV12-transformed p38alpha-/-cells, except for prohibitin, which was down-regulated. An excellent correlation was found between DIGE results and Western blot studies, indicating the reliability of the 2-D-DIGE analysis. The available evidence about the putative function of the identified proteins supports the emerging role of p38alpha as a negative regulator of tumorigenesis. Further studies are in progress to elucidate the implications of these findings in the regulation of H-Ras-induced transformation by p38alpha signaling.

Variation in the holm oak leaf proteome at different plant developmental
stages, between provenances and in response to drought stress.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S207-14.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Major proteins of the holm oak leaf proteome have been previously identified using a combination of 2-DE, MS analysis and BLAST similarity search (Jorge et al., Proteomics 2005, 5, 222-234). That study, conducted with field samples from mature trees, revealed the existence of a great variability in the 2-DE protein map, with qualitative as well as quantitative changes, both analytical and biological. A similar study has been carried out with 2-year-old seedlings to analyze and study: (i) changes in the 2-DE protein profile at different tree developmental stages; (ii) the 2-DE protein map variability between three different Spanish provenances; and (iii) variations in the 2-DE protein profile in response to drought stress. Although the protein profile of leaves from seedlings and mature trees was fairly similar, the biological variance found was lower in the former. In the present study, new proteins have been identified. At least four different protein spots differentiated Spanish provenances, two of them identified as an ATP synthase alpha chain, and a 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase. Fourteen different protein spots were qualitatively variable between well-watered and drought-stressed seedlings, with some of them corresponding to enzymes of carbohydrate and protein metabolism. Data presented indicated the mobilization of storage proteins and carbohydrates, as well as photosynthesis inhibition under drought conditions.

mass spectrometry.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S4-S11.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Quantitative proteomics using stable isotopic (16)O/(18)O labeling has emerged as a very powerful tool, since it has a number of advantages over other methods, including the simplicity of chemistry, the constant mass tag at the C termini and its general applicability. However, due to the small mass difference between labeled and unlabeled peptide species, this approach has usually been restricted to high-resolution mass spectrometers. In this study we explored whether the high-resolution scanning mode, together with the extremely high scanning speed of the linear IT allows the (16)O/(18)O-labeling method to be used for accurate, large-scale quantitative analysis of proteomes. A protocol, including digestion, desalting, labeling, MS and quantitative analysis was developed and tested using protein standards and whole proteome extracts. Using this method we were able to identify and quantify 140 proteins from only 10 mug of a proteome extract from mesenchymal stem cells. Relative expression changes larger than twofold can be identified with this method at the 95% confidence level. Our results demonstrate that accurate quantitative analysis using (16)O/(18)O labeling can be performed in the practice using linear IT MS, without compromising large-scale peptide identification efficiency.

<ABSTRACT>
Aerial parts (shoots) of maize seedlings fed hydroponically with 300 muM sodium arsenate [As(V)] or 250 muM sodium arsenite [As(III)] for 24 h were analyzed for differentially expressed proteins by 2-DE and digital image analysis. About 15% of total detected proteins (74 out of 500) were up- or, mainly, down-regulated by arsenic, among which 14 were selected as being those most affected by the metalloid. These proteins were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and 7 of them were identified: translation initiation factor eIF-5A, ATP synthase, cysteine synthase, malate dehydrogenase, protein kinase C inhibitor, Tn10 transposase-like protein, and guanine nucleotide binding protein. Each of these proteins was completely repressed by As(V) and/or As(III), except protein kinase C inhibitor, which was newly detected after exposure to As(V).

Systematic characterization of phosphorylation sites in NFATc2 by linear
ion trap mass spectrometry.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S16-27.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors regulate transcription of genes involved in the function of many different cellular systems. Activity of NFAT proteins is regulated by a complex interplay of phosphorylation events that are still poorly understood. In this work, we take advantage of the high scanning speed of the linear ion trap to develop a method to make a systematic characterization of NFATc2 phosphorylation. The method is based on the simultaneous monitoring of all tryptic peptides that can be detected by MS and contain potential phosphorylation sites. By this approach, we detected six NFATc2 phosphorylation sites by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) in vitro in only one experiment; a further site was also identified by performing digestion in solution. Using this approach, we have also characterized five basal phosphorylation sites in NFATc2 protein expressed in HEK cell cultures. Two of these NFATc2 phosphorylation sites in vivo have not been described before. The simplicity and sensitivity of this technique, which can be applied to any potential modification, makes it particularly attractive for the systematic detection of post-translational modifications of specific target proteins both in vitro and in vivo.

Proteomic analysis of detergent-resistant membranes from Candida albicans.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S74-81.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Lipid rafts are membrane microdomains with a higher amount of saturated fatty acids and sterols than the rest of the membrane. They are more resistant to the action of non-anionic detergents, and are called, for this reason, detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Lipid rafts are involved in many cellular processes, like signaling, cytokinesis, response to environment, etc., and therefore must contain important proteins. We have obtained a fraction enriched in proteins from Candida albicans DRMs. The sample has been analyzed by SDS-PAGE and 29 proteins have been identified including markers for lipid rafts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, like Pma1p and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein belonging to the Phr family. Ecm33p, a GPI-anchored protein involved in cell wall biogenesis, has been found for the first time in lipid rafts. We have also identified proteins implicated in protein glycosylation, like the mannosyltransferases Mnn7p, Pmt2p and Mnt1p; proteins involved in lipid metabolism, like Erg11p and Scs7p; and heat shock proteins, like Ssa1p and Hsp90p. Most of the proteins identified are located in plasma, mitochondrial, Golgi or ER membranes, supporting the postulated existence of lipid-raft domains in all the membranes.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S237-44.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The noncollagenous-1 domain of the alpha3 chain of collagen IV networks of basement membranes is the target of an antibody-mediated inflammatory response in Goodpasture autoimmune disease. This domain when excised from basement membranes by bacterial collagenase digestion exists in two molecular forms, M(H) and M(L), that differ in cleavage site and mobility in SDS-PAGE. In the present study, M(H) and M(L) were shown to also differ with respect to epitope exposure, susceptibility to endoprotease digestion, and redox states of specific cystene residues, as determined by MS. Moreover, M(H) and M(L) assemble to form different quaternary structures, critically influencing pathogenic epitope(s) exposure and autoantibody binding. Collectively, our findings reveal that M(H) and M(L) are conformational isomers stabilized by a distinct disulfide bond connectivity, and coexist in basement membranes. The hitherto unrecognized conformational diversification of the Goodpasture autoantigen may be of relevance in pathogenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
Acinetobacter baumannii is a multiresistant opportunistic nosocomial pathogen. A protein fraction was purified and analyzed by 2-DE. Twenty-nine major protein spots were selected for protein identification using trypsin digestion and MS analysis. As the A. baumannii genome has not yet been described, protein identification was performed by homology with other Acinetobacter species in the NCBi database. We identified ribosomal proteins, chaperones, elongation factors and outer membrane proteins (Omp), such as OmpA and the 33-36-kDa OMP. Proteomic analysis of A. baumannii provides a platform for further studies in antimicrobial resistance.

<ABSTRACT>
Secreted proteins of the human pathogen Corynebacterium diphtheriae might be involved in important pathogen-host cell interactions. Here, we present the first systematic reference map of the extracellular and cell surface proteome fractions of the type strain C. diphtheriae C7s(-)tox-. The analysis window of 2-DE covered the pI range from 3 to 10 along with a MW range from 8 to 150 kDa. Computational analysis of the 2-D gels detected almost 150 protein spots in the extracellular proteome fraction and about 80 protein spots of the cell surface proteome. MALDI-TOF-MS and PMF with trypsin unambiguously identified 107 extracellular protein spots and 53 protein spots of the cell surface, representing in total 85 different proteins of C. diphtheriae C7s(-)tox-. Several of the identified proteins are encoded by pathogenicity islands and might represent virulence factors of C. diphtheriae. Additionally, four solute-binding proteins (HmuT, Irp6A, CiuA, and FrgD) of different iron ABC transporters were identified, with the hitherto uncharacterized FrgD protein being the most abundant one of the cell surface proteome of C. diphtheriae C7s(-)tox-.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Monitoring environmental pollution using biomarkers requires detailed knowledge about the markers, and many only allow a partial assessment of pollution. New proteomic methods (environmental proteomics) can identify proteins that, after validation, might be useful as alternative biomarkers, although this approach also has its limitations, derived mainly from their application to non-model organisms. Initial studies using environmental proteomics were carried out in animals exposed to model pollutants, and led to the concept of protein expression signatures. Experiments have been carried out in model organisms (yeast, Arabidopsis, rat cells, or mice) exposed to model contaminants. Over the last few years, proteomics has been applied to organisms from ecosystems with different pollution levels, forming the basis of an environmental branch in proteomics. Another focus is connected with the presence of metals bound to biomolecules, which adds an additional dimension to metal-biomolecule and metalloprotein characterization - the field of metallomics. The metallomic approach considers the metallome: a whole individual metal or metalloid species within a cell or tissue. A metallomic analytical approach (MAA) is proposed as a new tool to study and identify metalloproteins.

<ABSTRACT>
We have developed a strategy to identify putative tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)receptors present in pancreatic cancer cells by affinity capture with tPA-Sepharose followed by 2-DE and MALDI-MS PMF. Proteins pulled down from either total lysates or raft membrane fractions were characterized and compared with those from a total lysate of an endothelial cell line (HUVEC) to identify pancreas-restricted tPA receptors. A total of 31 proteins were found by this approach, including annexin A2, already described as a tPA receptor in pancreas and endothelial cells, other proteins acting as tPA receptors (i.e., enolase, cytokeratins 8 and 18) in other tissues, and additional proteins not previously identified as candidate tPA receptors. Confirmation of the results was performed for some of these proteins using immunoblotting. These studies are the basis for further functional analyses on the role of these proteins in the biological effects of tPA.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S119-32.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Rhodococcus sp. strain TFB is a versatile gram-positive bacterium able to grow on a wide variety of aromatic compounds as carbon and energy sources. Since the strain is refractory to genetic analysis, a proteomic approach was used to study the metabolic pathways involved in the catabolism of such compounds by analyzing differentially induced proteins. The most marked difference was observed when the proteome profiles of phthalate-grown cells were compared with those cultured in the presence of tetralin- or naphthalene, suggesting that different metabolic pathways are involved in the degradation of mono- and polyaromatic compounds. Comparison with the proteome of glucose-grown cells indicated that each pathway was specifically induced by the corresponding aromatic compound. A combination of proteomics and molecular biology led to the identification of 14 proteins (65-80% identical to known Pht proteins) that describe a complete pathway for the catabolism of phthalate to central metabolites via intradiol cleavage of protochatechuic acid. Chaperonins were also induced in phthalate-grown cells, indicating that growth on this compound induces a stress response. Absence of catabolite repression by glucose was observed by both transcriptional and proteome analysis, suggesting that Rhodococcus sp. strain TFB may have advantages over other tightly regulated strains in bioremediation.

<ABSTRACT>
In the present study plasma samples from 15 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and 16 healthy controls of initially unknown haptoglobin (Hp) phenotype were separated by 2-DE, and tryptic digests of the excised Hpalpha polypeptide chain spots were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Selected tryptic peptides were sequenced by nano-(n)ESI-IT MS/MS. The six major Hp phenotypes were present, although with distinct frequencies in controls and SLE patients. Thus, there were an increased proportion of SLE patients with Hp 2-2, or Hp 2-1S phenotypes. The Hp phenotype distribution resulted in allele frequencies of 0 625 (Hp(2)), 0.281 (Hp(1S)), and 0.093 (Hp(1F)) in healthy controls, correlating fairly well with the allele frequencies of European populations. In contrast, the Hp allele frequencies of the SLE patients were 0.733 (Hp(2)), 0.233 (Hp(1S)), and 0.033 (Hp1(1F)), which clearly indicated an increased frequency of Hp(2), a similar proportion of Hp(1S) and a diminished proportion of Hp(1F) in SLE patients compared with that in healthy controls. Preferential Hpalpha2 expression in SLE patients may contribute to some of the clinical manifestations of the disease such as hypergammaglobulinemia, systemic vasculitis, and cardiovascular disorders.

<ABSTRACT>
Botrytis cinerea is a phytopathogenic fungi causing disease in a number of important crops. It is considered a very complex species in which different populations seem to be adapted to different hosts. In order to characterize fungal virulence factors, a proteomic research was started. A protocol for protein extraction from mycelium tissue, with protein separation by 2-DE and MS analysis, was optimised as a first approach to defining the B. cinerea proteome. Around 400 spots were detected in 2-DE CBB-stained gels, covering the 5.4-7.7 pH and 14-85 kDa ranges. The averages of analytical and biological coefficients of variance for 64 independent spots were 16.1% and 37.5%, respectively. Twenty-two protein spots were identified by MALDI-TOF or ESI IT MS/MS, with some of them corresponding to forms of malate dehydrogenase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Two more spots matched a cyclophilin and a protein with an unknown function.

Differential proteome profiles in E2F2-deficient T lymphocytes.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S42-50.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
E2F transcription factors are important regulators of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. We have previously shown that E2F2(-/- )mice develop late-onset autoimmune features, similar to systemic lupus erythematosus. E2F2-deficient T lymphocytes exhibit enhanced T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulated proliferation, which is presumably responsible for causing autoimmunity in E2F2-deficient mice. The comparison of E2F2(-/-) and wild-type T lymphocyte expression profiles by 2-DE followed by MS identification has revealed a set of deregulated proteins involved in TCR-mediated signaling, cell survival and stress responses. The deregulation of these proteins may account for the hyperproliferative phenotype that characterizes E2F2(-/- )T cells. Our work shows that proteomic analysis of gene-knockout strains can be a useful methodology to study the functional role of specific genes.

Proteotyping of human haptoglobin by MALDI-TOF profiling: Phenotype
distribution in a population of toxic oil syndrome patients.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S272-81.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Toxic oil syndrome (TOS) is a disease that appeared in Spain in 1981 as a consequence of the ingestion of an aniline-adulterated oil illegally marketed as edible. TOS affected more than 20 000 people and produced over 400 deaths in the first 18 months after the outbreak. There is evidence that genetic factors could play a role in the susceptibility of individuals towards the disease. Recently, we suggested that haptoglobin (Hp) polymorphism could also play a role in TOS. To provide a rapid method for high-throughput Hp phenotyping, we developed a two-step MALDI-TOF procedure that allows specific identification of the three common Hp alpha chains. Resolution of the homologous alpha-1s and alpha-1f chains, which have a mass difference of only 0.043 Da, is obtained after guanidination of the protein with O-methylisourea. We applied this procedure to the study of the distribution of the Hp alleles HP(1s), HP(1f), HP(2) in a control versus a TOS-affected population, both originally exposed to the toxic oil. The MALDI-TOF proteotyping method was validated by a parallel analysis of the serum samples by 2-DE. Data obtained from 54 TOS cases and 48 control individuals indicate significant differences in the distribution of Hp phenotypes in the two populations.

<ABSTRACT>
The utility of proteomics to assess pollutant response of Scrobicularia plana clams from three sites of Guadalquivir Estuary at the southern end of the National Park of Donana (SW Spain) has been studied. Protein expression profiles were analyzed by 2-DE in soluble fractions of S. plana gills. Nearly 2000 well-resolved spots were detected in silver-stained gels, with focused areas in the 4-6.5 pH range. Different protein expression signatures were found at each site, with the highest number of more intense spots in animals with the highest metal content. Nineteen more intense protein spots were analyzed out by nanospray-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry, de novo sequencing and a bioinformatics search for their possible identification. While sequence tags of 16 more intense protein spots were obtained, including several proteins induced by pollutant exposure of model organisms, only 2 proteins were unambiguously identified: hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH). Both enzymes were significantly higher in animals with the highest metal contents. Thus, we propose these two proteins, HPRT and G3PDH, as novel pollution biomarkers.

Genetic and proteomic evidences support the localization of yeast enolase
in the cell surface.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S107-18.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Although enolase, other glycolytic enzymes, and a variety of cytoplasmic proteins lacking an N-terminal secretion signal have been widely described as located at the cell surface in yeast and in mammalian cells, their presence in this external location is still controversial. Here, we report that different experimental approaches (genetics, cellular biology and proteomics) show that yeast enolase can reach the cell surface and describe the protein regions involved in its cell surface targeting. Hybrid enolase truncates, fused at their C terminus with the yeast internal invertase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as reporter proteins, proved that the 169 N-terminal amino acids are sufficient to target the protein to the cell surface. Furthermore, the enolase-GFP fusion co-localized with a plasma membrane marker. Enolase was also identified among membrane proteins obtained by a purification protocol that includes sodium carbonate to prevent cytoplasmic contamination. These proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS for peptide identification. Elongation factors, mitochondrial membrane proteins and a mannosyltransferase involved in cell wall mannan biosynthesis were also identified in this fraction.

Differential protein expression of murine macrophages upon interaction
with Candida albicans.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6 Suppl 1:S133-44.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Numerous studies highlight the importance of macrophages for optimal host protection against systemic Candida albicans infections. We chose the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 and the wild-type strain C. albicans SC5314 to study of the induced expression/repression of proteins in macrophages when they are in contact with C. albicans, based on 2-DE, comparison between different gels and protein identification. RAW 264.7 cells were allowed to interact with C. albicans cells for 45 min, and a significant differential protein expression was observed in these macrophages compared to controls. Gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby, allowing a better quantification of the intensity of the protein spots. Fifteen spots were up-regulated, whereas 32 were down-regulated; 60 spots appeared and 49 disappeared. Among them, we identified 11 proteins: annexin I, LyGDI (GDID4), Hspa5 (Grp78, Bip), tropomyosin 5 and L-plastin, that augment; and Eif3s5, Hsp60, Hspa9a, Grp58 (ER75), and Hspa8a (Hsc70), that decrease. The translation elongation factor (Eef2p) is modified in some of its different protein species. Many processes seem to be affected: cytoskeletal organisation, oxidative responses (superoxide and nitric oxide production) and protein biosynthesis and refolding.

Optimizing the surface plasmon resonance/mass spectrometry interface for
functional proteomics applications: how to avoid and utilize nonspecific
adsorption.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2355-64.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A great challenge in functional or interaction proteomics is to map protein networks and establish a functional relationship between expressed proteins and their effects on cellular processes. These cellular processes can be studied by characterizing binding partners to a "bait" protein against a complex background of other molecules present in cells, tissues, or biological fluids. This so-called ligand fishing process can be performed by combining surface plasmon resonance biosensors with MS. This combination generates a unique and automated method to quantify and characterize biomolecular interactions, and identify the interaction partners. A general problem in chip-based affinity separation systems is the large surface-to-volume ratio of the fluidic system. Extreme care, therefore, is required to avoid nonspecific adsorption, resulting in losses of the target protein and carry-over during the affinity purification process, which may lead to unwanted signals in the final MS analysis and a reduction in sensitivity. In this study, carry-over of protein and low-molecular weight substances has been investigated systematically and cleaning strategies are presented. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that by the introduction of colloidal particles as a capturing and transporting agent, the recovery yield of the affinity-purified ligand could be improved nearly twofold.

Proteomic analysis of serum marker proteins in recipient mice with liver
cirrhosis after bone marrow cell transplantation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2564-70.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We previously found that transplantation with bone marrow cells (BMCs) improves liver function and liver fibrosis in cirrhotic mice. In the presence of liver damage induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), transplanted BMC migrated into the peri-portal region and trans-differentiated into hepatocytes that produce albumin. Thus under these conditions, BMC transplantation induces liver regeneration. Detecting serum marker proteins is important to monitor the recovery of liver function of cirrhotic mice after BMC transplantation. We therefore initially resolved proteins extracted from serum samples at 48 h after BMC transplantation by 2-DE and compared spot intensity between control and BMC groups of mice. Six protein spots increased in the BMC group compared with the control group. MS revealed that these spots comprised apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), apolipoprotein C3 (apoC3), vitamin D-binding protein, alpha-1-antitrypsin and proteasome subunit alpha type 1. We subsequently confirmed the levels of apoA1 in serum and liver samples by immunoblotting. ApoA1 increased at early stage (48 h and 1 wk) after BMC transplantation in this mouse model of liver cirrhosis. The early elevation of apoA1 might be useful to predict liver regeneration in cirrhotic mice after BMC transplantation.

Proteome analysis of silk gland proteins from the silkworm, Bombyx mori.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2586-99.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The silk gland of Bombyx mori is an organ specialized for the synthesis and secretion of silk proteins. We report here the resolution of silk gland proteins by 2-DE and the identification of many of those proteins. This was accomplished by dissecting the glands into several sections, with each exhibiting more than 400 protein spots by 2-DE, of which 100 spots were excised and characterized by in-gel digestion followed by PMF. Ninety-three proteins were tentatively identified. These were then categorized into groups involved in silk protein secretion, transport, lipid metabolism, defense, etc. Western blotting of a 2-DE gel using an antibody of the carotenoid binding protein confirmed the presence of this protein in the silk gland. Proteins including fibroin L-chain and P25 were found as multiple isoforms, some of which contained differential amounts of phosphate residues as analyzed by on-probe dephosphorylation. The current analysis contributes to our understanding of proteins expressed by the silk gland not only of the model lepidopteran B. mori, but also to proteins from other silk-producing insects such as Philosamia cynthia ricini.

Profiling of membrane proteins from human macrophages: comparison of two

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2365-75.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Macrophages are involved in various important biological processes and their functions are tightly regulated. Hydrophobic proteins are difficult to analyse by 2-DE because of their intrinsic tendency to self-aggregate during the first dimension (IEF). We have compared two protocols for extracting, separating and identifying membrane proteins from human macrophages by MALDI-TOF MS. The first protocol used protein extraction by solvent, followed by 2-DE and allowed us to identify 10% membrane proteins among the proteins identified a being like the peroxisome-activated receptor delta. The second method is based on solubilizing the membranes with Triton X-100, separating the proteins by anion-exchange chromatography followed by SDS-PAGE. This method allowed us to identify 49 membrane proteins, including four integral membrane proteins, ten type I, two type II and one type III membrane proteins. Several receptors were identified, including integrin alpha-3 and ephrin type A receptor 7. Interestingly, several proteins involved in macrophage functions were identified, such as integrin alpha-X and macrophage mannose receptor. These findings show that techniques are available to identify membrane proteins, but that they require large quantities of cells which means that they are not suitable for the limiting amounts of precious samples available from clinical studies.

Proteins unique to intraphagosomally grown Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2485-94.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Pathogenic mycobacteria persist and replicate within phagosomes of host phagocytes by inhibiting phagosome maturation at an early endosome stage. The molecular basis for this behavior is not understood. To identify proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis unique to the intraphagosomal phase, mycobacteria were purified from phagosomes of infected murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and analyzed by high-resolution 2-DE and MS. Protein patterns of intraphagosomally grown M. tuberculosis were compared with those of broth-cultured mycobacteria. The analysis revealed 11 mycobacterial proteins exclusively detected in intraphagosomal mycobacteria. Some of these proteins are involved in metabolism and cell envelope synthesis, such as the lipid carrier protein Rv1627c, and the conserved hypothetical protein Rv1130 that shows homology to a virulence-associated protein of Legionella pneumophila. The relevance of these proteins as factors enabling intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis is being discussed.

Improved mass spectrometry compatibility is afforded by ammoniacal silver
staining.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2350-4.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Sequence coverage in MS analysis of protein digestion-derived peptides is a key issue for detailed characterization of proteins or identification at low quantities. In gel-based proteomics studies, the sequence coverage greatly depends on the protein detection method. It is shown here that ammoniacal silver detection methods offer improved sequence coverage over standard silver nitrate methods, while keeping the high sensitivity of silver staining. With the development of 2D-PAGE-based proteomics, another burden is placed on the detection methods used for protein detection on 2-D-gels. Besides the classical requirements of linearity, sensitivity, and homogeneity from one protein to another, detection methods must now take into account another aspect, namely their compatibility with MS. This compatibility is evidenced by two different and complementary aspects, which are (i) the absence of adducts and artefactual modifications on the peptides obtained after protease digestion of a protein detected and digested in - gel, and (ii) the quantitative yield of peptides recovered after digestion and analyzed by the mass spectrometer. While this quantitative yield is not very important per se, it is however a crucial parameter as it strongly influences the S/N of the mass spectrum and thus the number of peptides that can be detected from a given protein input, especially at low protein amounts. This influences in turn the sequence coverage and thus the detail of the analysis provided by the mass spectrometer.

Proteomic approach to study the cytotoxicity of dioscin (saponin).
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2422-32.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Dioscin, extracted from the root of Polygonatum zanlanscianense pamp, exhibits cytotoxicity towards human myeloblast leukemia HL-60 cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that the expression of mitochondrial associated proteins was substantially altered in HL-60 cells corresponding to the dioscin treatment, suggesting that mitochondria are the major cellular target of dioscin. Mitochondrial functional studies validated that mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was initiated by dioscin treatment. Changes in proteome other than mitochondrial related proteins implicate that other mechanisms were also involved in dioscin-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells, including the activity impairment in protein synthesis, alterations of phosphatases in cell signaling, and deregulation of oxidative stress and cell proliferation. Current study of protein alterations in dioscin-treated HL-60 cells suggested that dioscin exerts cytotoxicity through multiple apoptosis-inducing pathways.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2555-63.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Chloroplast RNA-binding proteins are involved in stabilizing stored chloroplast mRNAs and in recruiting site-specific factors that mediate RNA metabolism. In the present study, we characterized two major chloroplast RNA-binding proteins, cp29A and cp29B, by MALDI-TOF MS, N-terminal sequencing, and ESI-MS/MS following 2D-PAGE separation. Polypeptides derived from cp29A were recovered with free N-terminus or with N-terminal acetylation. In addition to the two isoforms found for cp29A, an isoform derived from cp29B was also observed to have five amino acids cleaved from its N-terminus. Results of quantitative real-time RT-PCR indicate that both genes reached maximal rates of transcription 96 h after commencement of germination and maintained relatively high levels throughout the whole life cycle. Transcription of cp29A and cp29B did not vary significantly under light or dark conditions, although production of the acetylated and N-terminally cleaved protein isoforms exhibited light dependence. Exposure of etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings to light conditions for as short as 9 h restored the modified isoforms to levels similar to those found in green plants. Identification of post-translational modifications in major chloroplast RNA-binding proteins may help elucidate their roles in seedling development and in plant RNA stabilization during the greening process.

<ABSTRACT>
In an effort to contribute to a better understanding of the hepatic toxicity of the ubiquitous environmental pollutant and hepatocarcinogen 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a comprehensive quantitative proteome analysis was performed on 5L rat hepatoma cells exposed to 1 nM TCDD for 8 h. Changes in the abundances of individual protein species in TCDD-treated cells as compared to untreated cells were analysed using the nongel-based isotope-coded protein label (ICPL) method [Schmidt, A., Kellermann, J., Lottspeich, F., Proteomics 2005, 5, 4-15]. 89 proteins were identified as up- or down-regulated by TCDD. For the majority of the altered proteins, an impact of TCDD on their abundance had not been known before. Due to the physicochemical properties or the translational regulation of a large number of the affected proteins, their alteration would have escaped detection by gel-based methods for proteome analysis and by standard mRNA expression profiling, respectively. The identified proteins with TCDD-altered abundance include several proteins implicated in cell cycle regulation, growth factor signalling and the control of apoptosis. The results thus provide new starting-points for the investigation of specific aspects of the toxicity and carcinogenicity of dioxin in liver.

Glutamine regulates the expression of proteins with a potential

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Glutamine is an essential amino acid for the enterocytes with respect to maintaining the gut mucosal integrity and function. This study was conducted to explore a molecular basis for the beneficial effects of glutamine on intestinal cells by searching for glutamine-dependent changes in the proteome. Caco-2 cells were exposed to different concentrations of L-glutamine with or without L-methionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of the glutamine synthetase activity. 2-DE combined with MALDI-TOF-MS was used to identify proteins whose expression is changed by glutamine. To assess the relative protein synthesis rate, incorporation of L-[2H5]glutamine into individual proteins was monitored. The expression levels of 14 proteins changed significantly with the glutamine availability. Examples of differentially expressed proteins with potential health-promoting effects on the intestine are plasma retinol-binding protein, ornithine aminotransferase, apolipoprotein A-I, mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, and acyl-CoA synthetase 5. Expression of these proteins was not changed by arginine deprivation. The differential change in the expression levels of the proteins was not correlated with their rate of synthesis, excluding an effect of glutamine depletion on general protein synthesis. Together, this study shows a gene-specific effect of glutamine on intestinal cells.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2504-29.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
As a highly reduced organism, pollen performs specialized functions to generate and carry sperm into the ovule by its polarily growing pollen tube. Yet the molecular genetic basis of these functions is poorly understood. Here, we identified 322 unique proteins, most of which were not reported previously to be in pollen, from mature pollen of Oryza sativa L. ssp japonica using a proteomic approach, 23% of them having more than one isoform. Functional classification reveals that an overrepresentation of the proteins was related to signal transduction (10%), wall remodeling and metabolism (11%), and protein synthesis, assembly and degradation (14%), as well as carbohydrate and energy metabolism (25%). Further, 11% of the identified proteins are functionally unknown and do not contain any conserved domain associated with known activities. These analyses also identified 5 novel proteins by de novo sequencing and revealed several important proteins, mainly involved in signal transduction (such as protein kinases, receptor kinase-interacting proteins, guanosine 5'-diphosphate dissociation inhibitors, C2 domain-containing proteins, cyclophilins), protein synthesis, assembly and degradation (such as prohibitin, mitochondrial processing peptidase, putative UFD1, AAA+ ATPase), and wall remodeling and metabolism (such as reversibly glycosylated polypeptides, cellulose synthase-like OsCsLF7). The study is the first close investigation, to our knowledge, of protein complement in mature pollen, and presents useful molecular information at the protein level to further understand the mechanisms underlying pollen germination and tube growth.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2174-9.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is an enteric human pathogen responsible for much worldwide morbidity and mortality. EPEC uses a type III secretion system to inject bacterial proteins into the cytosol of intestinal epithelial cells to cause diarrheal disease. We are interested in determining the host proteins to which EPEC translocator and effector proteins bind during infection. To facilitate protein enrichment, we created fusions between GST and EPEC virulence proteins, and expressed these fusions individually in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The biology of S. cerevisiae is well understood and often employed as a model eukaryote to study the function of bacterial virulence factors. We isolated the yeast proteins that interact with individual EPEC proteins by affinity purifying against the GST tag. These complexes were subjected to ICAT combined with ESI-MS/MS. Database searching of sequenced peptides provided a list of proteins that bound specifically to each EPEC virulence protein. The dataset suggests several potential mammalian targets of these proteins that may guide future experimentation.

<ABSTRACT>
A method for the diagnosis of the congenital disorders of glycosylation type I (CDG-I) by SELDI-TOF-MS of serum transferrin immunocaptured on protein chip arrays is described. The underglycosylation of glycoproteins in CDG-I produces glycoforms of transferrin with masses lower than that of the normal fully glycosylated transferrin. Immobilisation of antitransferrin antibodies on reactive-surface protein chip arrays (RS100) selectively enriched transferrin by at least 100-fold and allowed the detection of patterns of transferrin glycoforms by SELDI-TOF-MS using approximately 0.3 microL of serum/plasma. Abnormal patterns of immunocaptured transferrin were detected in patients with known defects in glycosylation (CDG-Ia, CDG-Ib, CDG-Ic, CDG-If and CDG-Ih) and in patients in whom the basic defect has not yet been identified (CDG-Ix). The correction of the N-glycosylation defect in a patient with CDG-Ib after mannose therapy was readily detected. A patient who had an abnormal transferrin profile by IEF but a normal profile by SELDI-TOF-MS analysis was shown to have an amino acid polymorphism by sequencing transferrin by quadrupole-TOF MS. Complete agreement was obtained between analysis of immunocaptured transferrin by SELDI-TOF-MS and the IEF profile of transferrin, the clinical severity of the disease and the levels of aspartylglucosaminidase activity (a surrogate marker for the diagnosis of CDG-I). SELDI-TOF-MS of transferrin immunocaptured on protein chip arrays is a highly sensitive diagnostic method for CDG-I, which could be fully automated using microtitre plates and robotics.

Differential post-translational modifications of transthyretin in
Alzheimer's disease: A study of the cerebral spinal fluid.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2305-13.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Transthyretin (TTR) is a 55 kDa homotetrameric protein. TTR in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is primarily synthesized by the choroid plexus. TTR can bind to the beta-amyloid peptide and a number of familial amyloidosis diseases (familial amyloid polyneuropathy) have been associated with its allele variants. In a transgenic mice model overexpression of TTR was positively correlated with a neuroprotective effect from the pathogenic APPsw mutation. TTR has a free reactive sulphydryl moiety located on the Cys(10) residue which has been implicated to undergo a variety of oxidation reactions. To examine the neuroprotective role of TTR, we investigated the conjugated forms of TTR with cysteine (Cys) and cysteinglycine (CsyGly) in the CSF of 39 probable Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected subjects and in a cohort of subjects without cognitive impairment (27 subjects). Linear MALDI-TOF MS experiments were employed to obtain high-resolution protein profiling of TTR isoforms. Nano-LC-TANDEM MS combined with reflectron MALDI-TOF-MS was used to unequivocally assign the investigated TTR-conjugate signals. Our results indicate a differential distribution of TTR-Cys and TTR-CsyGly adducts. Both oxidized forms of TTR are significantly less abundant in the AD group (p = 0.0001). The investigated population (66 subjects) was then diagnosed using the ratio of conjugated TTR to free TTR in each subject. A sensitivity >90% and a specificity >70% were derived from a receiver operating characteristic curve when the overall cohort is analysed by the TTR-Cys signals. This manuscript is the first report describing the presence of differential post-translational oxidations of TTR in the CSF of AD patients.

C-terminal sequencing method for proteins in polyacrylamide gel by the
reaction of acetic anhydride.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(7):2026-33.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
A successive C-terminal amino acid truncation reaction with acetic anhydride was applied on proteins in polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands separated by conventional SDS-PAGE were excised, partially fixed in the gel with glutaraldehyde ethanol solution, dehydrated with ACN and subjected to the truncation reaction with acetic anhydride formamide solution. Pre-treatment of the gel with pyridine aqueous solution was found to enhance the truncation reaction yields. After the truncation reaction, the products were treated with an aqueous solution of dimethylaminoethanol to hydrolyze oxazolone rings at the C termini of the truncated products and O-acetylated products of serine, threonine and/or tyrosine. Several commercially available proteins of 10-40 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE, such as myoglobin, trypsin inhibitor, alpha-hemolysin, cytochrome c, chymotrypsin C chain, elastase, acylase and histone H4, were subjected to the C-terminal analysis. The truncated proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin and the extracted peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, giving rise to a series of molecular mass ions of the C-terminal truncated fragments corresponding to the C-terminal amino acid sequence of the relevant protein.

<ABSTRACT>
The identification of functional proteomes is a major challenge in proteomic research. Here we describe a method for the detection and isolation of nuclear (localization sequence containing) proteins using a derepressed import receptor (DIRE) as a synthetic antibody. We demonstrate that the DIRE method specifically detects nuclear localization sequence containing proteins. Application to activation of primary T-lymphocytes exemplifies the potential use of DIRE for comparative proteomics and for diagnostics.

Recent evidence suggests that a subset of cancer cells within some tumors, the so-called cancer stem cells, may drive the growth and metastasis of these tumors. Understanding the pathways that regulate proliferation, self-renewal, survival, and differentiation of malignant and normal stem cells may shed light on mechanisms that lead to cancer and suggest better modes of treatment.

Cells often need to respond to multiple opposing signals simultaneously. In this issue of Cell, it is shown that challenging cells with multiple extracellular signals induces an external feedback that involves the release of and response to additional secreted factors with antagonistic functions. These results suggest that an individual cell's decision to die or survive is not wholly independent but depends, at least in part, on feedback from its neighbors.

Cell. 2006 Mar 24;124(6):1169-81.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Endogenous small RNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by mechanisms conserved across metazoans. While the number of verified human miRNAs is still expanding, only few have been functionally annotated. To perform genetic screens for novel functions of miRNAs, we developed a library of vectors expressing the majority of cloned human miRNAs and created corresponding DNA barcode arrays. In a screen for miRNAs that cooperate with oncogenes in cellular transformation, we identified miR-372 and miR-373, each permitting proliferation and tumorigenesis of primary human cells that harbor both oncogenic RAS and active wild-type p53. These miRNAs neutralize p53-mediated CDK inhibition, possibly through direct inhibition of the expression of the tumor-suppressor LATS2. We provide evidence that these miRNAs are potential novel oncogenes participating in the development of human testicular germ cell tumors by numbing the p53 pathway, thus allowing tumorigenic growth in the presence of wild-type p53.

The ubiquitin binding domain ZnF UBP recognizes the C-terminal diglycine
motif of unanchored ubiquitin.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Mar 24;124(6):1197-208.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Ubiquitin binding proteins regulate the stability, function, and/or localization of ubiquitinated proteins. Here we report the crystal structures of the zinc-finger ubiquitin binding domain (ZnF UBP) from the deubiquitinating enzyme isopeptidase T (IsoT, or USP5) alone and in complex with ubiquitin. Unlike other ubiquitin binding domains, this domain contains a deep binding pocket where the C-terminal diglycine motif of ubiquitin is inserted, thus explaining the specificity of IsoT for an unmodified C terminus on the proximal subunit of polyubiquitin. Mutations in the domain demonstrate that it is required for optimal catalytic activation of IsoT. This domain is present in several other protein families, and the ZnF UBP domain from an E3 ligase also requires the C terminus of ubiquitin for binding. These data suggest that binding the ubiquitin C terminus may be necessary for the function of other proteins.

The response of human epithelial cells to TNF involves an inducible
autocrine cascade.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Mar 24;124(6):1225-39.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a proinflammatory cytokine that induces conflicting pro- and antiapoptotic signals whose relative strengths determine the extent of cell death. TNF receptor (TNFR) has been studied in considerable detail, but it is not known how crosstalk among antagonistic pro- and antiapoptotic signals is achieved. Here we report an experimental and computational analysis of crosstalk between prodeath TNF and prosurvival growth factors in human epithelial cells. By applying classifier-based regression to a cytokine-signaling compendium of approximately 8000 intracellular protein measurements, we demonstrate that cells respond to TNF both directly, via activated TNF receptor, and indirectly, via the sequential release of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). We refer to the contingent and time-varying series of extracellular signals induced by TNF as an "autocrine cascade." Time-dependent crosstalk of synergistic and antagonistic autocrine circuits may serve to link cellular responses to the local environment.

Type II cadherin ectodomain structures: implications for classical
cadherin specificity.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Mar 24;124(6):1255-68.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Type I and II classical cadherins help to determine the adhesive specificities of animal cells. Crystal-structure determination of ectodomain regions from three type II cadherins reveals adhesive dimers formed by exchange of N-terminal beta strands between partner extracellular cadherin-1 (EC1) domains. These interfaces have two conserved tryptophan side chains that anchor each swapped strand, compared with one in type I cadherins, and include large hydrophobic regions unique to type II interfaces. The EC1 domains of type I and type II cadherins appear to encode cell adhesive specificity in vitro. Moreover, perturbation of motor neuron segregation with chimeric cadherins depends on EC1 domain identity, suggesting that this region, which includes the structurally defined adhesive interface, encodes type II cadherin functional specificity in vivo.

TRPA1 mediates the inflammatory actions of environmental irritants and
proalgesic agents.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Mar 24;124(6):1269-82.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
TRPA1 is an excitatory ion channel targeted by pungent irritants from mustard and garlic. TRPA1 has been proposed to function in diverse sensory processes, including thermal (cold) nociception, hearing, and inflammatory pain. Using TRPA1-deficient mice, we now show that this channel is the sole target through which mustard oil and garlic activate primary afferent nociceptors to produce inflammatory pain. TRPA1 is also targeted by environmental irritants, such as acrolein, that account for toxic and inflammatory actions of tear gas, vehicle exhaust, and metabolic byproducts of chemotherapeutic agents. TRPA1-deficient mice display normal cold sensitivity and unimpaired auditory function, suggesting that this channel is not required for the initial detection of noxious cold or sound. However, TRPA1-deficient mice exhibit pronounced deficits in bradykinin-evoked nociceptor excitation and pain hypersensitivity. Thus, TRPA1 is an important component of the transduction machinery through which environmental irritants and endogenous proalgesic agents depolarize nociceptors to elicit inflammatory pain.

Cell. 2006 Mar 24;124(6):1283-98.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
To enable arrayed or pooled loss-of-function screens in a wide range of mammalian cell types, including primary and nondividing cells, we are developing lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) libraries targeting the human and murine genomes. The libraries currently contain 104,000 vectors, targeting each of 22,000 human and mouse genes with multiple sequence-verified constructs. To test the utility of the library for arrayed screens, we developed a screen based on high-content imaging to identify genes required for mitotic progression in human cancer cells and applied it to an arrayed set of 5,000 unique shRNA-expressing lentiviruses that target 1,028 human genes. The screen identified several known and approximately 100 candidate regulators of mitotic progression and proliferation; the availability of multiple shRNAs targeting the same gene facilitated functional validation of putative hits. This work provides a widely applicable resource for loss-of-function screens, as well as a roadmap for its application to biological discovery.

A proteomic approach for dissecting H-Ras signaling networks in NIH/3T3
mouse embryonic fibroblast cells.
</TITLE>

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2433-43.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
To elucidate an understanding into H-Ras protein network, we have established various oncogene H-Ras-expressing NIH/3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cell clones, which are expressing G12V H-Ras, G12R H-Ras, and G12V/T35S H-Ras proteins under the tight control of expression by an antibiotic doxycycline. Here we provide a catalog of proteome profiles in total cell lysate derived from the oncogenic and partial loss of function H-Ras-expressing NIH/3T3 cells. In this biological context, we compared total proteome changes by the combined methods of 2-DE, quantitative image analysis and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis both commonly in oncogenic and partial loss of function H-Ras expression system. Thus, we tried to dissect H-Ras signaling pathway, especially a downstream effector molecule, Raf in NIH/3T3 cells using proteomics tools. In this study, we centralized upon the proteome profile changes as common targets for oncogenic H-Ras and a partial loss of function H-Ras in the H-Ras-expressing cells. Thirteen protein spots were selected as what the staining intensities on the gels for 2-DE images from both kinds of cells were consistently changed in their protein expression level. Differentially regulated expression was further confirmed for some subsets of candidates by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. Taken together, our results obtained and present here show that the comparative analysis of proteome from oncogenic and partial loss of function H-Ras-expressing cells has yielded interpretable data to elucidate the protein network directly and/or indirectly.

Effects of salinity levels on proteome of Suaeda aegyptiaca leaves.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr;6(8):2542-54.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Saline soils are the major problem of cultivated lands of Iran. Suaeda aegyptiaca is a salt-tolerant plant (halophytes) that grow naturally in salt-affected areas of Iran. We have employed proteomics to identify the mechanisms of salt responsiveness in leaves of S. aegyptiaca grown under different salt concentrations. Ten-day-old plants were treated with 0, 150, 300, 450, and 600 mM NaCl. After 30 days of treatment, leaf samples were collected and analyzed using 2-D-PAGE. Out of 700 protein spots reproducible detected within replications, 102 spots showed significant response to salt treatment compared to 0 mM NaCl. We analyzed expression pattern of salt-responsive proteins using a hierarchical and two nonhierarchical (Fuzzy ART and SOM) statistical methods and concluded that Fuzzy ART is the superior method. Forty proteins of 12 different expression groups were analyzed using LC/MS/MS. Of these, 27 protein spots were identified including proteins involved in oxidative stress tolerance, glycinebetain synthesis, cytoskeleton remodeling, photosynthesis, ATP production, protein degradation, cyanide detoxification, and chaperone activities. The expression pattern of these proteins and their possible roles in the adaptation of S. aegyptiaca to salinity is discussed.

Nodal flow and the generation of left-right asymmetry.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Apr 7;125(1):33-45.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The establishment of left-right asymmetry in mammals is a good example of how multiple cell biological processes coordinate in the formation of a basic body plan. The leftward movement of fluid at the ventral node, called nodal flow, is the central process in symmetry breaking on the left-right axis. Nodal flow is autonomously generated by the rotation of cilia that are tilted toward the posterior on cells of the ventral node. These cilia are built by transport via the KIF3 motor complex. How nodal flow is interpreted to create left-right asymmetry has been a matter of debate. Recent evidence suggests that the leftward movement of membrane-sheathed particles, called nodal vesicular parcels (NVPs), may result in the activation of the non-canonical Hedgehog signaling pathway, an asymmetric elevation in intracellular Ca(2+) and changes in gene expression.

A dominant complement fixation pathway for pneumococcal polysaccharides
initiated by SIGN-R1 interacting with C1q.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Apr 7;125(1):47-58.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The intricate system of serum complement proteins provides resistance to infection. A pivotal step in the complement pathway is the assembly of a C3 convertase, which digests the C3 complement component to form microbial binding C3 fragments recognized by leukocytes. The spleen and C3 provide resistance against blood-borne S. pneumoniae infection. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we studied SIGN-R1, a lectin that captures microbial polysaccharides in spleen. Surprisingly, conditional SIGN-R1 knockout mice developed deficits in C3 catabolism when given S. pneumoniae or its capsular polysaccharide intravenously. There were marked reductions in proteolysis of serum C3, deposition of C3 on organisms within SIGN-R1(+) spleen macrophages, and formation of C3 ligands. We found that SIGN-R1 directly bound the complement C1 subcomponent, C1q, and assembled a C3 convertase, but without the traditional requirement for either antibody or factor B. The transmembrane lectin SIGN-R1 therefore contributes to innate resistance by an unusual C3 activation pathway.

An RNA sensor for intracellular Mg(2+).

Cell. 2006 Apr 7;125(1):71-84.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Most RNA molecules require Mg(2+) for their structure and enzymatic properties. Here we report the first example of an RNA serving as sensor for cytoplasmic Mg(2+). We establish that expression of the Mg(2+) transporter MgtA of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is controlled by its 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). We show that the 5'UTR of the mgtA gene can adopt different stem-loop structures depending on the Mg(2+) levels, which determine whether transcription reads through into the mgtA coding region or stops within the 5'UTR. We could recapitulate the Mg(2+)-regulated transcription using a defined in vitro transcription system with RNA polymerase as the only protein component. The initiation of mgtA transcription responds to extracytoplasmic Mg(2+) and its elongation into the coding region to cytoplasmic Mg(2+), providing a singular example in which the same ligand is sensed in different cellular compartments to regulate disparate steps in gene transcription.

During anaphase, spindle elongation pulls sister chromatids apart until each pair is fully separated. In turn, cytokinesis cleaves the cell between the separated chromosomes. What ensures that cytokinesis proceeds only after that all chromosome arms are pulled out of the cleavage plane was unknown. Here, we show that a signaling pathway, which we call NoCut, delays the completion of cytokinesis in cells with spindle-midzone defects. NoCut depends on the Aurora kinase Ipl1 and the anillin-related proteins Boi1 and Boi2, which localize to the site of cleavage in an Ipl1-dependent manner and act as abscission inhibitors. Inactivation of NoCut leads to premature abscission and chromosome breakage by the cytokinetic machinery and is lethal in cells with spindle-elongation defects. We propose that NoCut monitors clearance of chromatin from the midzone to ensure that cytokinesis completes only after all chromosomes have migrated to the poles.

ESCRT-I core and ESCRT-II GLUE domain structures reveal role for GLUE in
linking to ESCRT-I and membranes.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Apr 7;125(1):99-111.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
ESCRT complexes form the main machinery driving protein sorting from endosomes to lysosomes. Currently, the picture regarding assembly of ESCRTs on endosomes is incomplete. The structure of the conserved heterotrimeric ESCRT-I core presented here shows a fan-like arrangement of three helical hairpins, each corresponding to a different subunit. Vps23/Tsg101 is the central hairpin sandwiched between the other subunits, explaining the critical role of its "steadiness box" in the stability of ESCRT-I. We show that yeast ESCRT-I links directly to ESCRT-II, through a tight interaction of Vps28 (ESCRT-I) with the yeast-specific zinc-finger insertion within the GLUE domain of Vps36 (ESCRT-II). The crystal structure of the GLUE domain missing this insertion reveals it is a split PH domain, with a noncanonical lipid binding pocket that binds PtdIns3P. The simultaneous and reinforcing interactions of ESCRT-II GLUE domain with membranes, ESCRT-I, and ubiquitin are critical for ubiquitinated cargo progression from early to late endosomes.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complexes are central to receptor downregulation, lysosome biogenesis, and budding of HIV. The yeast ESCRT-I complex contains the Vps23, Vps28, and Vps37 proteins, and its assembly is directed by the C-terminal steadiness box of Vps23, the N-terminal half of Vps28, and the C-terminal half of Vps37. The crystal structures of a Vps23:Vps28 core subcomplex and the Vps23:Vps28:Vps37 core were solved at 2.1 and 2.8 A resolution. Each subunit contains a structurally similar pair of helices that form the core. The N-terminal domain of Vps28 has a hydrophobic binding site on its surface that is conformationally dynamic. The C-terminal domain of Vps28 binds the ESCRT-II complex. The structure shows how ESCRT-I is assembled by a compact core from which the Vps23 UEV domain, the Vps28 C domain, and other domains project to bind their partners.

Tangential neuronal migration controls axon guidance: a role for
neuregulin-1 in thalamocortical axon navigation.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Apr 7;125(1):127-42.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Neuronal migration and axon guidance constitute fundamental processes in brain development that are generally studied independently. Although both share common mechanisms of cell biology and biochemistry, little is known about their coordinated integration in the formation of neural circuits. Here we show that the development of the thalamocortical projection, one of the most prominent tracts in the mammalian brain, depends on the early tangential migration of a population of neurons derived from the ventral telencephalon. This tangential migration contributes to the establishment of a permissive corridor that is essential for thalamocortical axon pathfinding. Our results also demonstrate that in this process two different products of the Neuregulin-1 gene, CRD-NRG1 and Ig-NRG1, mediate the guidance of thalamocortical axons. These results show that neuronal tangential migration constitutes a novel mechanism to control the timely arrangement of guidance cues required for axonal tract formation in the mammalian brain.

Coding of odors by a receptor repertoire.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Apr 7;125(1):143-60.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We provide a systematic analysis of how odor quality, quantity, and duration are encoded by the odorant receptor repertoire of the Drosophila antenna. We test the receptors with a panel of over 100 odors and find that strong responses are sparse, with response density dependent on chemical class. Individual receptors range along a continuum from narrowly tuned to broadly tuned. Broadly tuned receptors are most sensitive to structurally similar odorants. Strikingly, inhibitory responses are widespread among receptors. The temporal dynamics of the receptor repertoire provide a rich representation of odor quality, quantity, and duration. Receptors with similar odor sensitivity often map to widely dispersed glomeruli in the antennal lobe. We construct a multidimensional "odor space" based on the responses of each individual receptor and find that the positions of odors depend on their chemical class, concentration, and molecular complexity. The space provides a basis for predicting behavioral responses to odors.

Circannual control of hibernation by HP complex in the brain.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Apr 7;125(1):161-72.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Seasonal hibernation in mammals is under a unique adaptation system that protects organisms from various harmful events, such as lowering of body temperature (Tb), during hibernation. However, the precise factors controlling hibernation remain unknown. We have previously demonstrated a decrease in hibernation-specific protein (HP) complex in the blood of chipmunks during hibernation. Here, HP is identified as a candidate hormone for hibernation. In chipmunks kept in constant cold and darkness, HP is regulated by an individual free-running circannual rhythm that correlates with hibernation. The level of HP complex in the brain increases coincident with the onset of hibernation. Such HP regulation proceeds independently of Tb changes in constant warmth, and Tb decreases only when brain HP is increased in the cold. Blocking brain HP activity using an antibody decreases the duration of hibernation. We suggest that HP, a target of endogenously generated circannual rhythm, carries hormonal signals essential for hibernation to the brain.

<ABSTRACT>
Organs and organelles represent core biological systems in mammals, but the diversity in protein composition remains unclear. Here, we combine subcellular fractionation with exhaustive tandem mass spectrometry-based shotgun sequencing to examine the protein content of four major organellar compartments (cytosol, membranes [microsomes], mitochondria, and nuclei) in six organs (brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, and placenta) of the laboratory mouse, Mus musculus. Using rigorous statistical filtering and machine-learning methods, the subcellular localization of 3274 of the 4768 proteins identified was determined with high confidence, including 1503 previously uncharacterized factors, while tissue selectivity was evaluated by comparison to previously reported mRNA expression patterns. This molecular compendium, fully accessible via a searchable web-browser interface, serves as a reliable reference of the expressed tissue and organelle proteomes of a leading model mammal.

Cell. 2006 Apr 7;125(1):187-99.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Protein localization to membrane-enclosed organelles is a central feature of cellular organization. Using protein correlation profiling, we have mapped 1,404 proteins to ten subcellular locations in mouse liver, and these correspond with enzymatic assays, marker protein profiles, and confocal microscopy. These localizations allowed assessment of the specificity in published organellar proteomic inventories and demonstrate multiple locations for 39% of all organellar proteins. Integration of proteomic and genomic data enabled us to identify networks of coexpressed genes, cis-regulatory motifs, and putative transcriptional regulators involved in organelle biogenesis. Our analysis ties biochemistry, cell biology, and genomics into a common framework for organelle analysis.

<ABSTRACT>
Peroxisomes are present in nearly every eukaryotic cell and compartmentalize a wide range of important metabolic processes. Glycosomes of Kinetoplastid parasites are peroxisome-like organelles, characterized by the presence of the glycolytic pathway. The two replicating stages of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, the mammalian bloodstream form (BSF) and the insect (procyclic) form (PCF), undergo considerable adaptations in metabolism when switching between the two different hosts. These adaptations involve also substantial changes in the proteome of the glycosome. Comparative (non-quantitative) analysis of BSF and PCF glycosomes by nano LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS resulted in the validation of known functional aspects of glycosomes and the identification of novel glycosomal constituents.

Comprehensive glyco-proteomic analysis of human alpha(1)-antitrypsin and

Proteomics. 2006 Apr 18;6(11):3369-3380.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Human alpha(1)-antitrypsin (A1PI) is a well-known glycoprotein in human plasma important for the protection of tissues from proteolytic enzymes. The three N-glycosylation sites of A1PI contain diantennary N-glycans but also triantennary and even traces of tetraantennary structures leading to the typical IEF pattern observed for A1PI. Here we present an approach to characterize A1PI isoforms from human plasma and its PTMs by LC-ESI-MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS of peptides obtained by proteolytic digestion. The single cysteine residue of A1PI formed a disulfide bridge with free cysteine. The variability of the number of antennae and hence sialic acids on glycosylation site N107, which even contained minute amounts of tetraantennary structures, emerged as a major cause for the IEF pattern of A1PI. Only negligible amounts of triantennary structures were identified attached to N70, and exclusively diantennary structures were present on site N271 in each of the isoforms analyzed. Exoglycosidase digests revealed alpha2,6-linked neuraminic acids on diantennary N-glycans, and triantennary contained additionally one single alpha2,3-neuraminic acid per N-glycan, which, together with a fucose, formed a sialyl Lewis X determinant on the beta1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine, as shown by 2-D-HPLC of pyridylaminated asialoglycans. Fucosylation of diantennary structures was marginal and of the core alpha1,6 type.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr 18;6(11):3262-3274.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We reported recently that moderate hypoxia and hypoxia-mimetic agents could induce growth arrest and differentiation of leukemic cells via the mediation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha), but the exact molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, human acute promonocytic leukemic U937 cells were incubated under 2% O(2) or in 50 microM of the hypoxia mimetic agent cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)) and normal oxygen for 24 h, and their protein expression profiles were compared by 2-DE coupled with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS. We identified 62 and 16 proteins that were significantly deregulated by hypoxia and CoCl(2) treatment, respectively. These proteins were mainly involved in metabolism, gene expression regulation, signal transduction, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. As an example, N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), a putative differentiation-related gene, was up-regulated in both 2% O(2)- and CoCl(2)-treated U937 cells. Moreover, enforced HIF-1alpha expression also elevated NDRG1 mRNA and protein in U937 cells. These data will provide some clues for understanding mechanisms by which leukemic cells response to hypoxia.

<ABSTRACT>
Knowledge of early molecular events occurring upon ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) during liver transplantation (LT) is of great importance to improve the therapeutic intervention of surgical treatment. However, nowadays, few data are available on early protein targets of I/R injury. To identify these proteins, we used a differential proteomics approach in the characterization human liver biopsies during I/R upon LT. Analyses were performed on nine donor livers during LT. By using 2-DE and MALDI-TOF MS, we identified 36 proteins which resulted significantly altered upon I/R injury. The majority of these proteins are functionally involved in lipid and energy metabolism, in different metabolic pathways, in redox signalling and in oxidative-stress response. Our data represent the first global approach in the study of I/R injury in liver.

endotoxin-induced uveitis: Involvement of crystallin truncation in uveitis
pathogenesis.

<ABSTRACT>
Endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) is an animal model of acute ocular inflammation. To characterize the mechanism of EIU, we analyzed the infiltration of proteins in the vitreous bodies of rats with EIU and normal rats using 2-DE and micro LC/LC-MS/MS. Twenty spots were identified in vitreous bodies of rats. Eighteen of these spots were members of the crystallin family. The truncated form of beta A4- and beta B2-crystallin were predominant in normal vitreous bodies, but there were intact form of crystallins in lipopolysaccharide-injected rats with EIU. These results suggest that crystallin family proteins are the major group of proteins involved in uveitic vitreous and that C-terminal truncation of beta-crystallins may play a role in EIU-related disease progression.

<ABSTRACT>
Bacteria use a variety of means to communicate with one another and with their eukaryotic hosts. In some cases, social interactions allow bacteria to synchronize the behavior of all of the members of the group and thereby act like multicellular organisms. By contrast, some bacterial social engagements promote individuality among members within the group and thereby foster diversity. Here we explore the molecular mechanisms underpinning some recently discovered bacterial communication systems. These include long- and short-range chemical signaling channels; one-way, two-way, and multi-way communication; contact-mediated and contact-inhibited signaling; and the use and spread of misinformation or, more dramatically, even deadly information.

FSH directly regulates bone mass.

Cell. 2006 Apr 21;125(2):247-60.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Postmenopausal osteoporosis, a global public health problem, has for decades been attributed solely to declining estrogen levels. Although FSH levels rise sharply in parallel, a direct effect of FSH on the skeleton has never been explored. We show that FSH is required for hypogonadal bone loss. Neither FSHbeta nor FSH receptor (FSHR) null mice have bone loss despite severe hypogonadism. Bone mass is increased and osteoclastic resorption is decreased in haploinsufficient FSHbeta+/- mice with normal ovarian function, suggesting that the skeletal action of FSH is estrogen independent. Osteoclasts and their precursors possess G(i2alpha)-coupled FSHRs that activate MEK/Erk, NF-kappaB, and Akt to result in enhanced osteoclast formation and function. We suggest that high circulating FSH causes hypogonadal bone loss.

Cell. 2006 Apr 21;125(2):261-74.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The intracellular compartment harboring Toxoplasma gondii satisfies the parasite's nutritional needs for rapid growth in mammalian cells. We demonstrate that the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) of T. gondii accumulates material coming from the host mammalian cell via the exploitation of the host endo-lysosomal system. The parasite actively recruits host microtubules, resulting in selective attraction of endo-lysosomes to the PV. Microtubule-based invaginations of the PV membrane serve as conduits for the delivery of host endo-lysosomes within the PV. These tubular conduits are decorated by a parasite coat, including the tubulogenic protein GRA7, which acts like a garrote that sequesters host endocytic organelles in the vacuolar space. These data define an unanticipated process allowing the parasite intimate and concentrated access to a diverse range of low molecular weight components produced by the endo-lysosomal system. More generally, they identify a unique mechanism for unidirectional transport and sequestration of host organelles.

Synergistic functions of SII and p300 in productive activator-dependent
transcription of chromatin templates.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Apr 21;125(2):275-86.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
We have reconstituted a highly purified RNA polymerase II transcription system containing chromatin templates assembled with purified histones and assembly factors, the histone acetyltransferase p300, and components of the general transcription machinery that, by themselves, suffice for activated transcription (initiation and elongation) on DNA templates. We show that this system mediates activator-dependent initiation, but not productive elongation, on chromatin templates. We further report the purification of a chromatin transcription-enabling activity (CTEA) that, in a manner dependent upon p300 and acetyl-CoA, strongly potentiates transcription elongation through several contiguous nucleosomes as must occur in vivo. The transcription elongation factor SII is a major component of CTEA and strongly synergizes with p300 (histone acetylation) at a step subsequent to preinitiation complex formation. The purification of CTEA also identified HMGB2 as a coactivator that, while inactive on its own, enhances SII and p300 functions.

Structural basis for RNA unwinding by the DEAD-box protein Drosophila
Vasa.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Apr 21;125(2):287-300.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
DEAD-box RNA helicases, which regulate various processes involving RNA, have two RecA-like domains as a catalytic core to alter higher-order RNA structures. We determined the 2.2 A resolution structure of the core of the Drosophila DEAD-box protein Vasa in complex with a single-stranded RNA and an ATP analog. The ATP analog intensively interacts with both of the domains, thereby bringing them into the closed form, with many interdomain interactions of conserved residues. The bound RNA is sharply bent, avoiding a clash with a conserved alpha helix in the N-terminal domain. This "wedge" helix should disrupt base pairs by bending one of the strands when a duplex is bound. Mutational analyses indicated that the interdomain interactions couple ATP hydrolysis to RNA unwinding, probably through fine positioning of the duplex relative to the wedge helix. This mechanism, which differs from those for canonical translocating helicases, may enable the targeted modulation of intricate RNA structures.

<ABSTRACT>
Polycomb group proteins are essential for early development in metazoans, but their contributions to human development are not well understood. We have mapped the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) subunit SUZ12 across the entire nonrepeat portion of the genome in human embryonic stem (ES) cells. We found that SUZ12 is distributed across large portions of over two hundred genes encoding key developmental regulators. These genes are occupied by nucleosomes trimethylated at histone H3K27, are transcriptionally repressed, and contain some of the most highly conserved noncoding elements in the genome. We found that PRC2 target genes are preferentially activated during ES cell differentiation and that the ES cell regulators OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG cooccupy a significant subset of these genes. These results indicate that PRC2 occupies a special set of developmental genes in ES cells that must be repressed to maintain pluripotency and that are poised for activation during ES cell differentiation.

<ABSTRACT>
The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs). This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development. We explored this by examining histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed "bivalent domains," consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells. These results highlight the importance of DNA sequence in defining the initial epigenetic landscape and suggest a novel chromatin-based mechanism for maintaining pluripotency.

Alpha3Na+/K+-ATPase is a neuronal receptor for agrin.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Apr 21;125(2):359-69.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Agrin, through its interaction with the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK, mediates accumulation of acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at the developing neuromuscular junction. Agrin has also been implicated in several functions in brain. However, the mechanism by which agrin exerts its effects in neural tissue is unknown. Here we present biochemical evidence that agrin binds to the alpha3 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) in CNS neurons. Colocalization with agrin binding sites at synapses supports the hypothesis that the alpha3NKA is a neuronal agrin receptor. Agrin inhibition of alpha3NKA activity results in membrane depolarization and increased action potential frequency in cortical neurons in culture and acute slice. An agrin fragment that acts as a competitive antagonist depresses action potential frequency, showing that endogenous agrin regulates native alpha3NKA function. These data demonstrate that, through its interaction with the alpha3NKA, agrin regulates activity-dependent processes in neurons, providing a molecular framework for agrin action in the CNS.

KIF4 motor regulates activity-dependent neuronal survival by suppressing
PARP-1 enzymatic activity.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Apr 21;125(2):371-83.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
In brain development, apoptosis is a physiological process that controls the final numbers of neurons. Here, we report that the activity-dependent prevention of apoptosis in juvenile neurons is regulated by kinesin superfamily protein 4 (KIF4), a microtubule-based molecular motor. The C-terminal domain of KIF4 is a module that suppresses the activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), a nuclear enzyme known to maintain cell homeostasis by repairing DNA and serving as a transcriptional regulator. When neurons are stimulated by membrane depolarization, calcium signaling mediated by CaMKII induces dissociation of KIF4 from PARP-1, resulting in upregulation of PARP-1 activity, which supports neuron survival. After dissociation from PARP-1, KIF4 enters into the cytoplasm from the nucleus and moves to the distal part of neurites in a microtubule-dependent manner. We suggested that KIF4 controls the activity-dependent survival of postmitotic neurons by regulating PARP-1 activity in brain development.

A hybrid vector for ligand-directed tumor targeting and molecular imaging.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Cell. 2006 Apr 21;125(2):385-98.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Merging tumor targeting and molecular-genetic imaging into an integrated platform is limited by lack of strategies to enable systemic yet ligand-directed delivery and imaging of specific transgenes. Many eukaryotic viruses serve for transgene delivery but require elimination of native tropism for mammalian cells; in contrast, prokaryotic viruses can be adapted to bind to mammalian receptors but are otherwise poor vehicles. Here we introduce a system containing cis-elements from adeno-associated virus (AAV) and single-stranded bacteriophage. Our AAV/phage (AAVP) prototype targets an integrin. We show that AAVP provides superior tumor transduction over phage and that incorporation of inverted terminal repeats is associated with improved fate of the delivered transgene. Moreover, we show that the temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of gene expression mediated by targeted AAVP can be monitored by positron emission tomography. This new class of targeted hybrid viral particles will enable a wide range of applications in biology and medicine.

Proteomic analysis of recurrent spontaneous abortion: Identification of an

<ABSTRACT>
Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA), defined as the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies prior to the 20th week of gestation, affects up to 5% of the child-bearing population. To investigate the proteins associated with RSA, the protein expression in human follicular fluid was analyzed using 2-DE. Follicular fluid contains a variety of biologically important proteins for oocyte fertilization and follicle maturation in the mammalian reproductive process. Therefore, it can be used as a provisional source for identifying proteins involved in RSA. In this study, we identified five aberrantly expressed proteins (complement component C3c chain E, fibrinogen gamma, antithrombin, angiotensinogen, and hemopexin precursor) in follicular fluid from RSA patients with MALDI-TOF-MS and nano-LC MS/MS. Western blot analysis confirmed that the protein expression level of fibrinogen gamma and antithrombin was less in follicular fluid from RSA patients than those from normal controls. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and real-time PCR analyses revealed that mRNA level of these coagulation factors was also decreased significantly in chorionic villi of RSA patients compared with normal samples. Taken all together, it is likely that coagulation factors (fibrinogen gamma and antithrombin) play an important role in maintaining the normal pregnancy.

<ABSTRACT>
Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is often used as a model to investigate toxicity mechanisms and adaptation to hazardous chemicals in bacteria. The objective of this paper was to test the impact of the chlorophenoxy herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propanoic acid (DCPP) and their metabolites 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) and 3,5-dichlorocatechol (DCC), on protein expression patterns and physiological parameters. Both approaches showed that DCC has a different mode of action and induces different responses than DCPP, 2,4-D and DCP. DCC was the most toxic compound and was active as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. It repressed the synthesis of ferric uptake regulator (Fur)-dependent proteins, e.g. fumarase C and L-ornithine N5-oxygenase, which are involved in oxidative stress response and iron uptake. DCPP, 2,4-D and DCP were less toxic than DCC. They disturbed oxidative phosphorylation to a lesser extent by a yet unknown mechanism. Furthermore, they repressed enzymes of energy-consuming biosynthetic pathways and induced membrane transporters for organic substrates. A TolC homologue component of multidrug resistance transporters was found to be induced, which is probably involved in the removal of lipophilic compounds from membranes.

Proteomic analysis of the anterior cingulate cortex in the major
psychiatric disorders: Evidence for disease-associated changes.
</TITLE>
<SOURCE>
Proteomics. 2006 Apr 24;6(11):3414-3425.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Abnormalities of the anterior cingulate cortex have previously been described in schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. In this study 2-DE was performed followed by mass spectrometric sequencing to identify disease-specific protein changes within the anterior cingulate cortex in these psychiatric disorders. The 2-DE system comprised IPGs 4-7 and 6-9 in the first, IEF dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. Resultant protein spots were compared between control and disease groups. Statistical analysis indicated that 35 spots were differentially expressed in one or more groups. Proteins comprising 26 of these spots were identified by mass spectroscopy. These represented 19 distinct proteins; aconitate hydratase, malate dehydrogenase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase A, ATP synthase, succinyl CoA ketoacid transferase, carbonic anhydrase, alpha- and beta-tubulin, dihydropyrimidinase-related protein-1 and -2, neuronal protein 25, trypsin precursor, glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamine synthetase, sorcin, vacuolar ATPase, creatine kinase, albumin and guanine nucleotide binding protein beta subunit. All but three of these proteins have previously been associated with the major psychiatric disorders. These findings provide support for the view that cytoskeletal and mitochondrial dysfunction are important components of the neuropathology of the major psychiatric disorders.

Identification of candidate antigen in Whipple's disease using a
serological proteomic approach.

<ABSTRACT>
Whipple's disease (WD) is a chronic multisystemic infection, caused by Tropheryma whipplei, a Gram-positive rod. Recently, a reliable method has been developed for cultivating T. whipplei in vitro. This together with the availability of complete genome sequence of T. whipplei prompted us to initiate proteome analysis of T. whipplei. The objective of the present study was to identify candidate proteins for serological diagnosis of WD. Immunoreactivities of sera collected from 18 patients with WD were compared with those of 24 control subjects who did not have WD. For this, we used 2-DE, immunoblotting, and MS. In total, we identified 23 candidate antigenic proteins. These included a subset of six proteins, each of which was found significantly more frequently in cases as compared to their controls. The remaining 17 proteins were found exclusively in cases. The methods we used in the current study enabled us to identify candidate antigens that, in our view, might be useful for serological diagnosis of WD.

Proteome analysis of rice uppermost internodes at the milky stage.

Proteomics. 2006 Apr 24;6(11):3330-3338.
</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Uppermost internodes, which connect the part between the ear and lower stem, form an important pathway transporting mineral nutrition from roots and photosynthates from leaves (especially the flag leaf) to the ear. The milky stage is the first stage of seed ripening. The uppermost internodes of rice at the milky stage are critical for seed quality and yield. Total soluble proteins of the uppermost internodes of rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) at the milky stage were analyzed using proteomic methods. Using 2-DE, 762 reproducible protein spots were detected. Among them, 132 abundant proteins were analyzed using MALDI-TOF-MS. Searching in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, we could identify 98 proteins, which represent 80 gene products. These proteins belong to 11 functional groups with energy production-associated proteins in the first place. The large accumulation of proteins involved in metabolism, signaling, and stress resistance indicated that the uppermost internodes of rice have a high physiological and stress-resistant activity. In addition, our results will also enrich the database of the rice proteome.

Possible dysregulation of chaperon and metabolic proteins in cystic

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease due to mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene. A systematic approach to generate a protein expressional pattern in CF bronchial tissue has not been performed so far. It was the aim of this hypothesis-generating study to construct differential proteomes of bronchial biopsies in controls (n = 8) and CF patients (n = 9). Biopsies (pools of three per patient) were taken; proteins were extracted and run on 2-DE with subsequent in-gel digestion and mass spectrometrical identification and quantification of proteins using specific software. Three hundred sixty-six protein spots were identified and compared between groups. Following an approach for multiple testing correction, the chaperone 75 kDa glucose-regulated protein and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex core protein I and one form of nidogen, a pseudogene of aconitase 2, were increased in CF (p < 0.005). Aberrant protein levels may reflect molecular changes of CF as well as CF-linked inflammation, infection and cellular stress response.

<ABSTRACT>
To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer metastasis and search for potential markers for metastatic progression, we have developed a highly metastatic variant of human MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cell line through in vivo stepwise selection of pulmonary metastatic cells caused by parental MDA-MB-435 cells in the athymic mice. Comparative proteomic analysis using 2-DE and LC-IT-MS revealed that 102 protein spots were reproducibly altered more than three-fold between the selected variant and its parental counterpart. Eleven differentially expressed protein spots were identified with high confidence using SEQUEST with uninterpreted tandem mass raw data. Cathepsin D precursor, peroxiredoxin 6 (PDX6), heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), HSP60, tropomyosin 1 (TPM1), TPM2, TPM3, TPM4, 14-3-3 protein epsilon, and tumor protein D54 were up-regulated in the highly metastatic variant, whereas alpha B-crystalline (CRAB) was only detected in its parental counterpart. Differential expression was confirmed for four proteins including PDX6, CRAB, TPM4, and HSP60 by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis in our model. Immunohistochemical analysis in 80 breast cancer donors demonstrated a significant association of TPM4 (p = 0.002), HSP60 (p = 0.001), PDX6 (p = 0.002) but not CRAB (p = 0.113) staining with the presence of lymph node metastasis. In addition, TPM4 staining was also associated with clinical stage (p = 0.000), but no significant association was found between TPM4, PDX6, CRAB, and HSP60 expression and tumor size, hormone receptor, and HER-2 status (p > 0.05). The functional implication of these identified proteins was also discussed. These proteomic data are valuable and informative for understanding breast cancer metastasis and searching for potential markers for metastatic progression.

Selective binding and enrichment for low-molecular weight biomarker
molecules in human plasma after exposure to nanoporous silica particles.

<ABSTRACT>
The present manuscript describes a biomarker capturing strategy based on nanoporous silica particles. The method is shown to enrich the yield of species in the low-molecular weight proteome (LMWP), allowing detection of small peptides in the low-nanomolar range. Plasma samples were exposed to the silica particles, and the captured molecular species were profiled using MALDI-TOF. Mass spectra of the silica-treated human plasma samples showed a significant enrichment in MALDI-TOF protein profiles in the LMWP. Preliminary results indicated good level of reproducibility in plasma profiles with CVs on peak heights ranging from 6.3 to 14.7%. The MALDI-TOF signature changed significantly when the characteristics of the nanoporous silica were altered. The facile sample pretreatment before MS analysis, coupled to the potential for tailoring the surface properties of silica supports, hold promise for improving the recovery of low-abundance serum biomarkers.

<ABSTRACT>
The purpose of this study was to analyze altered protein expression in cancer tissues and determine its relationship to prognosis in colorectal carcinomas. We performed proteomic expression analysis on 14 colorectal carcinomas and matched nontumorous colonic mucosa by 2-DE and MALDI-TOF-MS. Comparative analysis of the respective spot patterns on 2-DE showed 14 spots that were markedly changed in the colorectal carcinomas. Among them, selenium-binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) was markedly decreased in 12 (85%) carcinomas. The reduced expression of SELENBP1 was further supported by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Suppression of SELENBP1 was further analyzed in another eight-paired adenomas and carcinomas from the same patients using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, and revealed that one adenoma and seven carcinomas exhibited markedly reduced SELENBP1 expression. Patients with low levels of SELENBP1 expression had significantly lower overall survival rates (72 vs. 85%, p = 0.021) among the 240 stages II and III colorectal carcinomas by using tissue microarray analysis. Our findings indicate that suppression of SELENBP1 is a frequent and late event in colorectal carcinogenesis, and may contribute to the rapid progression of colorectal carcinoma.

<ABSTRACT>
In the absence of a suitable carbohydrate-based vaccine, outer membrane vesicle (OMV) vaccines have been used to disrupt outbreaks of serogroup B meningococcal disease for more than 20 years. Proteomic technology provides physical methods with the potential to assess the composition and consistency of these complex vaccines. 2-DE, combined with MS, were used to generate a proteome map of an OMV vaccine, developed to disrupt a long-running outbreak of group B disease in New Zealand. Seventy four spots from the protein map were identified including the outer membrane protein (OMP) antigens: PorA, PorB, RmpM and OpcA. Protein identification indicates that, in addition to OMPs, OMV vaccines contain periplasmic, membrane-associated and cytoplasmic proteins. 2-D-DIGE technology highlighted differences between preclinical development batches of vaccines from two different manufacturers.

</SOURCE>
<ABSTRACT>
The selective removal of high-abundance proteins is considered to be an important prerequisite for a sensitive proteome analysis in plasma. In this study, we examined the "multiaffinity removal system", an immunoaffinity depletion column targeted against six plasma proteins. As determined by sandwich ELISA, the depletion rate for each target protein is >99% over 200 cycles of regeneration. Our data give evidence that two column antibodies are slowly inactivated during the repeated use of the column; however, the individual depletion rate meets the specification of the manufacturer. To estimate a potential loss of analytes after the immunodepletion, we performed spiking/recovery experiments with a selection of tumor markers at concentrations in the lower to medium ng/mL range. The average recovery of 9 out of 11 markers is 78%. A significant proportion of two other markers binds to the column. Based on the average marker recovery and a depletion of ;85% of the total protein we estimate a five-fold enrichment of a potential biomarker by the use of this depletion column. We conclude that the selective depletion of plasma proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography is a valid strategy for the enrichment of potential biomarkers sought by proteomics methodologies.
