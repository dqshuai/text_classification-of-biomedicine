This is the Readme file (Readme_IAS.txt) of the Second BioCreAtIvE challenge 
Protein-protein Interaction task (Interaction Article Sub-task), version June 2006.


This directory contains the following files:

1) bc2_ppi_ias_pmid_pos.txt
Contains the PubMed identifiers (PMID's)  of the positive training set, i.e. of articles which are relevant for protein interaction curation in the sense of the annotation process and guidelines used by the MINT and IntAct databases.  For a detailed subtask description refer to bc2_ppi_ias.pdf
This set contains 3536 PMID's

2) bc2_ppi_ias_abstract_pos.txt
Contains the abstracts and titles of the positive training set in xml-like format. (For format description refer to bc2_ppi_ias.pdf).

3) bc2_ppi_ias_pmid_neg.txt
Contains the PubMed identifiers (PMID's)  of the negative training set, i.e. of articles which are NOT relevant for protein interaction curation in the sense of the annotation process and guidelines used by the MINT and IntAct databases. This set contains 1959 PMID's

4) bc2_ppi_ias_abstract_neg.txt
Contains the abstracts and titles of the negative training set in xml-like format. (For format description refer to bc2_ppi_ias.pdf).

5) bc2_ppi_ias_pmid_pos_noisy.txt
Contains the PubMed identifiers (PMID's)  of the noisy positive training set, i.e. of articles which are relevant for protein interaction curation as used by other interaction databases (namely
BIND, HPRD, MPACT and GRID) and thus do not necessarily follow the guidelines used by the MINT and IntAct.  For a detailed subtask description refer to bc2_ppi_ias.pdf
This set contains 18930 PMID's

6) bc2_ppi_ias_abstract_pos_noisy.txt
Contains the abstracts and titles of the noisy positive training set in xml-like format. (For format description refer to bc2_ppi_ias.pdf).

7) bc2_ppi_ias.pdf
Corresponds to the IAS description in pdf format.
